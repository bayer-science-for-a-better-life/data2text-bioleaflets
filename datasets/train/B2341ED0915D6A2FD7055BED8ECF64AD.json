NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \nEach vial contains 5 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of solution for \ninjection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of \nanhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in a vial. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is also \nsuitable for the treatment of hyperglycaemic coma and ketoacidosis, as well as for achieving pre-, \nintra- and post-operative stabilisation in patients with diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before \na meal. \n \nIn the treatment of severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis in particular, insulin administration is part \nof a complex therapeutic regimen which includes measures to protect patients from possible severe \ncomplications of a relatively rapid lowering of blood glucose. This regimen requires close monitoring \n(metabolic status, acid-base and electrolyte status, vital parameters etc.) in an intensive care unit or \nsimilar setting. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid must not be used in external or implanted insulin pumps or in \nperistaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is administered subcutaneously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid may also be administered intravenously. Intravenous insulin therapy \nmust generally take place in an intensive care unit or under comparable monitoring and treatment \nconditions (see \"Daily doses and timing of administration\"). \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nInjection site swelling \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is \nthe phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC Code: A10AB01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following \nsubcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between \n1 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous \nadministration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site \nreactions \n\nInjection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC Code: A10AB01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following \nsubcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between \n1 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous \nadministration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach cartridge contains 3 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in a cartridge. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is also \nsuitable for the treatment of hyperglycaemic coma and ketoacidosis, as well as for achieving pre-, \nintra- and post-operative stabilisation in patients with diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before \na meal. \n \nIn the treatment of severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis in particular, insulin administration is part \nof a complex therapeutic regimen which includes measures to protect patients from possible severe \ncomplications of a relatively rapid lowering of blood glucose. This regimen requires close monitoring \n(metabolic status, acid-base and electrolyte status, vital parameters etc.) in an intensive care unit or \nsimilar setting. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid must not be used in external or implanted insulin pumps or in \nperistaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is administered subcutaneously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid may also be administered intravenously. Intravenous insulin therapy \nmust generally take place in an intensive care unit or under comparable monitoring and treatment \nconditions (see \"Daily doses and timing of administration\"). \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter.

Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nconditions Injection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling; \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC Code: A10AB01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following \nsubcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between \n1 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous \nadministration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach pen contains 3 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before \na meal. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is administered subcutaneously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nHandling of the pen \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC Code: A10AB01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following \nsubcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between \n1 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous \nadministration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed \nwithout a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. \n\n\u2022 Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. \n\u2022 The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm \nup. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nThe used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. \n \nMaintenance \n \nSoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. \n \nThe outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nThe pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. \n \nSoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should \navoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be \ndamaged, he must use a new one. \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nThe label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. \n \nAfter removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked: \nThe insulin solution (Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid) must be clear, colourless, with no solid particles \nvisible, and must have a water-like consistency. Do not use this SoloStar if insulin is cloudy, coloured \nor has particles. \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nOnly needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\nA new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should \nbe carefully attached straight onto the pen. \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nPrior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly \nand to remove air bubbles. \n \nA dose of 2 units has to be selected. \nThe outer and inner needle caps should be removed. \n \nWhile holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently \nwith the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nThen the injection button should be pressed in completely. \n \nIf insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. \nIf no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose \ngreater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. \n \nThe dose window must show \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nThe patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. \nThe injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down \n10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nThe needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent \ncontamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles \nmut not be re-used. \n \nSpecial caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety \nmeasures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) \nin order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. \n \nThe pen cap should be replaced on the pen. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of \nsuspension for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to \n0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an isophane insulin suspension. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected subcutaneously 45 to 60 minutes before \na meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal must \nnever be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n44 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n46 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting, ATC Code: A10AC01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal (an isophane insulin suspension) is an insulin with gradual onset and \nlong duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 60 minutes, the \nphase of maximum action is between 3 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 11 to \n20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg).  \nEach vial contains 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an isophane insulin suspension. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected subcutaneously 45 to 60 minutes before \na meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal must \nnever be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFur further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n51 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n52 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site \nerythema;  \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting, ATC Code: A10AC01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal (an isophane insulin suspension) is an insulin with gradual onset and \nlong duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 60 minutes, the \nphase of maximum action is between 3 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 11 to \n20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected subcutaneously 45 to 60 minutes before \na meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n59 \n\nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal must \nnever be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60 \n\nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nPens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Basal cartridges \nThe Insulin Human Winthrop Basal cartridges should only be used with the following pens:  \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Basal in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop \nBasal in 1 unit dose increments. \nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \nestablished with the listed pens.  \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, generalised \nskin reactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nreactions \n\nInjection site urticaria Injection site inflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n63 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting, ATC Code: A10AC01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n64 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal (an isophane insulin suspension) is an insulin with gradual onset and \nlong duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 60 minutes, the \nphase of maximum action is between 3 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 11 to \n20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

Not all of these pens may be \nmarketed in your country. \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.  \n \nThe manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen malfunctions (see instructions for using the pen), the suspension may be drawn from the \ncartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected. \n \nCartridges \nBefore insertion into the pen, Insulin Human Winthrop Basal must be kept at room temperature for 1 \nto 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge \nback and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick \nand thorough mixing of the contents. \n \nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again \nprior to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nmust not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if \nclumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. \nThese changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge \nyielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the \ninsulin requirement changes substantially. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n66 \n\nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nIt must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those \ndesigned specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see \nsection 6.2. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in \nthe cartridge. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an isophane insulin suspension. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected subcutaneously 45 to 60 minutes before \na meal. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n68 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal must \nnever be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n69 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nHandling of the pen \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n70 \n\nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n71 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n72 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting, ATC Code: A10AC01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n73 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal (an isophane insulin suspension) is an insulin with gradual onset and \nlong duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 60 minutes, the \nphase of maximum action is between 3 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 11 to \n20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nProtamine sulphate, \nmetacresol, \nphenol, \nzinc chloride, \nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, \nglycerol, \nsodium hydroxide, \nhydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), \nwater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances such \nas thioles and sulphites.  \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal must not be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin analogues. \n \nCare must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \nShelf life after first use of the pen \nThe pen in-use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25\u00b0C and \naway from direct heat or direct light. \nPens in-use must not be stored in the refrigerator. \nThe pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n74 \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nNot in-use pens \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nDo not put Insulin Human Winthrop Basal next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. \nKeep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nIn-use pens \nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) \nand a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and \nbromobutyl rubber (type 1)).  \nEach cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). \nThe cartridges are sealed in a disposable pen injector. \nInjection needles are not included in the pack. \nPacks of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 pens are available. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nBefore first use, Insulin Human Winthrop Basal must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and \nthen resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at \nleast ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing \nof the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nmust not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if \nclumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. \nThese changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nIt must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n75 \n\nHandling of the pen \nThe patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet \ncarefully before using SoloStar. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be \n\nperformed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed \nwithout a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. \n\n\u2022 Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. \n\u2022 The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm \nup. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nThe used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. \n \nMaintenance \n \nSoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. \n \nThe outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nThe pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. \n \nSoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should \navoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be \ndamaged, he must use a new one. \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nThe label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. \n \nAfter removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked: \nThe insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should \nbe mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should \nbe turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance. \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nOnly needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nA new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should \nbe carefully attached straight onto the pen. \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nPrior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly \nand to remove air bubbles. \n \nA dose of 2 units has to be selected. \nThe outer and inner needle caps should be removed. \n \nWhile holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently \nwith the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nThen the injection button should be pressed in completely. \n \nIf insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. \nIf no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose \ngreater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. \n \nThe dose window must show \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nThe patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional.  \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. \nThe injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down \n10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nThe needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent \ncontamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles \nmut not be re-used. \n \nSpecial caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety \nmeasures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) \nin order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. \n \nThe pen cap should be replaced on the pen. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 15% \ndissolved insulin and 85% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n79 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood\u2013glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n80 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n81 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n82 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site \nerythema;  \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n83 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n84 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 15% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 11 to 20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n86 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg).  \nEach vial contains 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 15% \ndissolved insulin and 85% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n88 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n89 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n91 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 15% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 11 to 20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n95 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human fomulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach cartridge contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 15% \ndissolved insulin and 85% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injectionin a cartridge. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n97 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n98 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nPens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 cartridges \nThe Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 cartridges should only be used with the following pens:  \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 in 1 unit dose increments. \nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \nestablished with the listed pens.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n99 \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n101 \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 15% \ndissolved insulin and 85% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n106 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n107 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nHandling of the pen \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n108 \n\nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n109 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n110 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n111 \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 15% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 11 to 20 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen \nyielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n113 \n\nHandling of the pen \nThe patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet \ncarefully before using SoloStar. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be \n\nperformed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed \nwithout a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. \n\n\u2022 Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly.  \n\u2022 The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm \nup. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nThe used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. \n \nMaintenance \n \nSoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. \n \nThe outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nThe pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. \n \nSoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should \navoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be \ndamaged, he must use a new one. \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nThe label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. \n \nAfter removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked: \nThe insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should \nbe mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should \nbe turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance. \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nOnly needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n114 \n\n \nA new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should \nbe carefully attached straight onto the pen. \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nPrior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly \nand to remove air bubbles. \n \nA dose of 2 units has to be selected. \nThe outer and inner needle caps should be removed. \n \nWhile holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently \nwith the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nThen the injection button should be pressed in completely. \n \nIf insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. \nIf no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose \ngreater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. \n \nThe dose window must show \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nThe patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional.  \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. \nThe injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down \n10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nThe needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent \ncontamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles \nmut not be re-used. \n \nSpecial caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety \nmeasures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) \nin order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. \n \nThe pen cap should be replaced on the pen. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 25% \ndissolved insulin and 75% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n117 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n118 \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n119 \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n120 \n\nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site \nerythema;  \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n121 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n122 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 25% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nProtamine sulphate, \nmetacresol, \nphenol, \nzinc chloride, \nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, \nglycerol, \nsodium hydroxide, \nhydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), \nwater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances \nsuch as thioles and sulphites.  \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n123 \n\nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be mixed with insulin human formulations designed \nspecifically for use in insulin pumps.  \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must also not be mixed with insulins of animal origin or with \ninsulin analogues. \nInsulins of different concentration (e.g. 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml) must not be mixed. \n \nCare must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \nShelf life after first use of the vial \nThe product may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25\u00b0C and away from direct heat or \ndirect light. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \nIt is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nUnopened vials \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nDo not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nOpened vials \nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n5 ml suspension in a vial (type 1 colourless glass) with a flanged cap (aluminium), a stopper \n(chlorobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a tear-off cap (polypropylene). \nPacks of 1 and 5 vials are available. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nBefore withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. \n \nImmediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be \nresuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n124 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n126 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood\u2013glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n127 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n128 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n129 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n130 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n131 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 25% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n133 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nPens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges \nThe Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges should only be used with the following pens:  \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 in 1 unit dose increments. \nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \nestablished with the listed pens.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n137 \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n139 \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n140 \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 25% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

Not all of these pens \nmay be marketed in your country. \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.  \n \nThe manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen malfunctions (see instructions for using the pen), the suspension may be drawn from the \ncartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected. \n \nCartridges \nBefore insertion into the pen, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for \n1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the \ncartridge back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate \nquick and thorough mixing of the contents. \n \nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again \nprior to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the \ncartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n142 \n\ncartridge yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge \nif the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n \nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed \nin the cartridge. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 25% \ndissolved insulin and 75% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n144 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n145 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nHandling of the pen \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n146 \n\nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n147 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n148 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n149 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 25% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth \n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \nmixing of the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the \ncartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen \nyielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n151 \n\nHandling of the pen \nThe patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet \ncarefully before using SoloStar. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be \n\nperformed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed \nwithout a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. \n\n\u2022 Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. \n\u2022 The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm \nup. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nThe used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. \n \nMaintenance \n \nSoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. \n \nThe outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nThe pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. \n \nSoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should \navoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be \ndamaged, he must use a new one. \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nThe label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. \n \nAfter removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked: \nThe insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should \nbe mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should \nbe turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance. \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nOnly needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n152 \n\n \nA new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should \nbe carefully attached straight onto the pen. \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nPrior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly \nand to remove air bubbles. \n \nA dose of 2 units has to be selected. \nThe outer and inner needle caps should be removed. \n \nWhile holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently \nwith the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nThen the injection button should be pressed in completely. \n \nIf insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. \nIf no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose \ngreater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. \n \nThe dose window must show \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nThe patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional.  \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. \nThe injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down \n10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nThe needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent \ncontamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles \nmut not be re-used. \n \nSpecial caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety \nmeasures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) \nin order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. \n \nThe pen cap should be replaced on the pen. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of \nsuspension for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to \n0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 30% \ndissolved insulin and 70% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n155 \n\nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 30 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n156 \n\n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n157 \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n158 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.

In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain ; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n159 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 30 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n162 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach cartridge contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 30% \ndissolved insulin and 70% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a cartridge. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n164 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 30 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n165 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nPens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges \nThe Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges should only be used with the following pens:  \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 30 in 1 unit dose increments. \nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \nestablished with the listed pens.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n166 \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 30% \ndissolved insulin and 70% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n173 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 30 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n174 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nHandling of the pen \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n175 \n\nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n176 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n177 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n178 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, \nonset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after \ninjection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. \n\n\u2022 Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. \n\u2022 The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm \nup. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nThe used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. \n \nMaintenance \n \nSoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. \n \nThe outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nThe pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. \n \nSoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should \navoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be \ndamaged, he must use a new one. \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nThe label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. \n \nAfter removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked: \nThe insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should \nbe mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should \nbe turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance. \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nOnly needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n181 \n\n \nA new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should \nbe carefully attached straight onto the pen. \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nPrior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly \nand to remove air bubbles. \n \nA dose of 2 units has to be selected. \nThe outer and inner needle caps should be removed. \n \nWhile holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently \nwith the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nThen the injection button should be pressed in completely. \n \nIf insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. \nIf no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose \ngreater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. \n \nThe dose window must show \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nThe patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional.  \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. \nThe injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down \n10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nThe needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent \ncontamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles \nmut not be re-used. \n \nSpecial caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety \nmeasures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) \nin order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. \n \nThe pen cap should be replaced on the pen. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 50% \ndissolved insulin and 50% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a vial. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n184 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n185 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n186 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n187 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site \nerythema;  \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n188 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n189 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous \ninjection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and \n4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nProtamine sulphate, \nmetacresol, \nphenol, \nzinc chloride, \nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, \nglycerol, \nsodium hydroxide, \nhydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), \nwater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances \nsuch as thioles and sulphites.  \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n190 \n\nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with insulin human formulations designed \nspecifically for use in insulin pumps.  \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must also not be mixed with insulins of animal origin or with \ninsulin analogues. \nInsulins of different concentration (e.g. 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml) must not be mixed. \n \nCare must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \nShelf life after first use of the vial \nThe product may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25\u00b0C and away from direct heat or \ndirect light. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \nIt is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nUnopened vials \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nDo not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nOpened vials \nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n5 ml suspension in a vial (type 1 colourless glass) with a flanged cap (aluminium), a stopper \n(chlorobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a tear-off cap (polypropylene). \nPacks of 1 and 5 vials are available. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nBefore withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. \n \nImmediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be \nresuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n191 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n193 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The \ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n194 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n195 \n\n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n196 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site \nerythema;  \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n197 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n198 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous \ninjection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and \n4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a \nfrosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. \nThese changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a \nuniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n200 \n\nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but notwith \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.  \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nPens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges \nThe Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges should only be used with the following pens:  \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 in 1 unit dose increments. \nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \nestablished with the listed pens.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n204 \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n205 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n206 \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n207 \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous \ninjection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and \n4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6.

Not all of these pens \nmay be marketed in your country. \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.  \n \nThe manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen malfunctions (see instructions for using the pen), the suspension may be drawn from the \ncartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected. \n \nCartridges \nBefore insertion into the pen, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for \n1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the \ncartridge back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate \nquick and thorough mixing of the contents. \n \nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again \nprior to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the \ncartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n209 \n\ncartridge yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge \nif the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n \nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in \ninfusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps. \n \nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with \nthose designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, \nsee section 6.2. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed \nin the cartridge. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 50% \ndissolved insulin and 50% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient\u2019s diet, physical \nactivity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes \nbefore a meal. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n211 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must never be injected intravenously. \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \narea must be rotated from one injection to the next. \n \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation \nis available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n212 \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nHandling of the pen \nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n213 \n\nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n214 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \nreactions (hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site \nurticaria \n\nInjection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n215 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n \nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n \nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nEyes disorders \nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n \nManagement \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n \nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n216 \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved \ninsulin) is an insulin with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous \ninjection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and \n4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nProtamine sulphate, \nmetacresol, \nphenol, \nzinc chloride, \nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, \nglycerol, \nsodium hydroxide, \nhydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), \nwater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances \nsuch as thioles and sulphites.  \n \nMixing of insulins \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin \nanalogues. \n \nCare must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years. \n \nShelf life after first use of the pen \nThe pen in-use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25\u00b0C and \naway from direct heat or direct light. \nPens in-use must not be stored in the refrigerator. \nThe pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n217 \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nNot in-use pens \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nDo not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. \nKeep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nIn-use pens \nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) \nand a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and \nbromobutyl rubber (type 1)). \nEach cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). \nThe cartridges are sealed in a disposable pen injector. \nInjection needles are not included in the pack. \nPacks of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 pens are available. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nBefore first use, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours \nand then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth \n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \nmixing of the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n \nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, \nor if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the \ncartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen \nyielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin \nrequirement changes substantially. \nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nIt must be remembered that \n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n \nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n218 \n\nHandling of the pen \nThe patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet \ncarefully before using SoloStar. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be \n\nperformed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed \nwithout a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. \n\n\u2022 Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. \n\u2022 The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm \nup. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nThe used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. \n \nMaintenance \n \nSoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. \n \nThe outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nThe pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. \n \nSoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should \navoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be \ndamaged, he must use a new one. \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nThe label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. \n \nAfter removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked: \nThe insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should \nbe mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should \nbe turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance. \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nOnly needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n219 \n\n \nA new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should \nbe carefully attached straight onto the pen. \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nPrior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly \nand to remove air bubbles. \n \nSelect a dose of 2 units. \nThe outer and inner needle caps should be removed. \n \nWhile holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently \nwith the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nThen the injection button should be pressed in completely. \n \nIf insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. \nIf no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose \ngreater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. \n \nThe dose window must show \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nThe patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. \nThe injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down \n10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nThe needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent \ncontamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles \nmut not be re-used. \n \nSpecial caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety \nmeasures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) \nin order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. \n \nThe pen cap should be replaced on the pen. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach vial contains 10 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. One IU (International \nUnit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in a vial. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin \npumps. It is specially stabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and \nthermal stress in such pumps. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is therefore also suitable for \ncontinuous insulin infusion with other, conventional injection syringe pumps. \n \nThe desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and \nadjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nWhen used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously \n(\"basal rate\"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals. Refer to the \noperating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the \nnecessary safety precautions. \n \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, \nand the rest is given as bolus injections before meals. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n222 \n\n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to \nthe technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat may be infused by the subcutaneous route. It is designed for use in \nthe Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron insulin pumps. It may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it \nhas been shown that they are suitable for this insulin (see pump manual). Only tetrafluoroethylene or \npolyethylene catheters must be used. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic \npumps with silicone tubing.  \n \nInsulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions. This is facilitated by the special equipment \navailable for the insulin pumps (e.g. catheters, cannulas). \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). The puncture site within a given \ninjection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days). \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient \nhas recovered complete consciousness. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n223 \n\nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n224 \n\n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nInsulin pump faults \nHyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed \ncompletely. Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to \na bolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction. \n \nIn the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or \npen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection. For details on safety precautions in the use of \ninsulin pumps, refer to the operator\u2019s manual. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n225 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n226 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC Code: A10AB01. \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin \n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of \ninsulin do not reflect its metabolic action. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).  \nEach cartridge contains 3.15 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 315 IU insulin. One IU \n(International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n \nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in a cartridge. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin \npumps. It is specially stabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and \nthermal stress in such pumps. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is therefore also suitable for \ncontinuous insulin infusion with other, conventional injection syringe pumps. \n \nThe desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and \nadjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. \n \nDaily doses and timing of administration \nWhen used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously \n(\"basal rate\"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals. Refer to the \noperating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the \nnecessary safety precautions. \n \nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \ndaily requirement. Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, \nand the rest is given as bolus injections before meals. \n \nSecondary dose adjustment \nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n- the patient's weight changes, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n231 \n\n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (\u226765 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nMethod of administration \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to \nthe technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat in cartridges may be infused by the subcutaneous route. It is \ndesigned for use in the Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron insulin pumps. It may also be used in other insulin \npumps for which it has been shown that they are suitable for this insulin and this type of cartridge (see \npump manual). Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used. \n \nInsulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions. This is facilitated by the special equipment \navailable for the insulin pumps (e.g. catheters, cannulas). \n \nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). The puncture site within a given \ninjection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days). \n \nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is \navailable must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and \u2013 where necessary \u2013 in \nconjunction with anti-allergic treatment. \n \nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a \ntransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat, since they may experience immunological \ncross-reactions. \n \nIn case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient \nhas recovered complete consciousness. \n \nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n232 \n\nTransfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dosage. \nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n \nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required \nin particular in patients who \n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n \nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n \nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia). \n \nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly,  \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n \nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n233 \n\n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. \n \nInsulin pump faults \nHyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed \ncompletely. Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to \na bolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction. \n \nIn the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or \npen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection. For details on safety precautions in the use of \ninsulin pumps, refer to the operator\u2019s manual. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n \nMedication errors \nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other \ninsulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each \ninjection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n \nCombination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If \nthe combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight \ngain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms \noccurs.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n234 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A \nlimited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to \nmarketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during \nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \ncan be presented. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n235 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \nallergic reactions \n(hypotension, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nbronchospasm, \ngeneralised skin \nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \nretinopathy; \nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \ninflammation;  \nInjection site pain; \nInjection site pruritus; \nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n \nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid may also be used \nfor treating hyperglycaemic coma (coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up \nof acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling \nblood sugar before, during and after surgery. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n330 \n\nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n331 \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n332 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional \ncircumstances, into a vein (blood vessel).  \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nInsulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, \nrequires experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a \nsimilar setting. \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid in insulin pumps \u2013 special insulin preparations are \navailable for use in such devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid \nparticles visible, and has a water-like consistency. \n \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you \nto measure the correct dose. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n333 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. Inject \nas soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per \nml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Rapid and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data.  \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n334 \n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n338 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n339 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid 40 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid may also be used \nfor treating hyperglycaemic coma (coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up \nof acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling \nblood sugar before, during and after surgery. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n340 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n341 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast--eeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n342 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional \ncircumstances, into a vein (blood vessel).  \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nInsulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, \nrequires experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a \nsimilar setting. \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid in insulin pumps \u2013 special insulin preparations are \navailable for use in such devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid \nparticles visible, and has a water-like consistency. \n \nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you \nto measure the correct dose. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n343 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. Inject \nas soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per \nml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Rapid and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannnot \nbe estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart \nattack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low \nblood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n344 \n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store Insulin Human Rapid \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \nafter \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened vials \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid next to \nthe freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from \nlight. \n \nOpened vials \nOnce in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25\u00b0C and \naway from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a \nlamp) Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be \nnoted on the label. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n348 \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n349 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid may also be used \nfor treating hyperglycaemic coma (coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up \nof acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling \nblood sugar before, during and after surgery. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n350 \n\nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOher medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n351 \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n352 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional \ncircumstances, into a vein (blood vessel).  \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nInsulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, \nrequires experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a \nsimilar setting. \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are \navailable for use in such devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid cartridges are to be used only \nwith the following pens: \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. \n \nLook at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid \nparticles visible, and has a water-like consistency. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n353 \n\n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n \nProblems with the pen? \n \nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. \nTherefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes \nwhich are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Rapid and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n354 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n358 \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n359 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml, solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully, including the Instructions for Use of Insulin Winthrop Rapid \nSoloStar, pre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. It \ncomes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n360 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n361 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n362 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nHow to handle SoloStar \n \nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. \n \nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n \nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved \nfor use with SoloStar. \nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n \nLook at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid if you notice \nparticles in it. Only use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid if the solution is clear, colourless and \nwaterlike. \n \nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \nyou think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid SoloStar pre-filled pen, \nis not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n363 \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n \nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be \ndiscarded and a new SoloStar has to be used. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Rapid and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n364 \n\n \nOther side effects include (frequency annot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n368 \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n369 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Rapid SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions \nfor Use. \n \nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n \nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n \nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n \nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n \nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or \ncall the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \n\nwith SoloStar. \n\u2022 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\u2022 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \n\naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n\u2022 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour \nwill vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below \nare for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nB.

Attach the needle \n \nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \nneedle blocks. \n \nBefore use of needle, carefully read the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d accompanying the needles. \n \nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \n\ndepending on the needle type). \n \n\n . \n \n\n\u2022 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n   \n \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\u2022 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\u2022 removing air bubbles \n \nA.

Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n   \n \nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  \n \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \n\nremove them. \n\u2022 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \n\nthis SoloStar. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n \nA. Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n \nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units).

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. The insulin is present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n375 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n376 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n377 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n378 \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. Inject \nas soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per \nml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of \nthis leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Basal and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n379 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n383 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n384 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. The insulin is present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n385 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n386 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n387 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n388 \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. Inject \nas soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per \nml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Basal and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n389 \n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \nafter \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened vials \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Basal next to \nthe freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from \nlight. \n \nOpened vials \nOnce in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25\u00b0C and \naway from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a \nlamp). Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be \nnoted on the label. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n393 \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n394 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. The insulin is present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal.  \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n395 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n396 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol. \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n397 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps \u2013 special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Basal cartridges are to be used only \nwith the following pens: \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the \ninsulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \nthen be used. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n398 \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n \nProblems with the pen? \n \nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. \nTherefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes \nwhich are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Hun Winthrop Basal \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of \nthis leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Basal and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n399 \n\n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \ncartridge after \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened cartridges \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Basal next to \nthe freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect \nfrom light. \n \nIn-use cartridges \nCartridges in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks \nnot above 25\u00b0C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct \nsunlight or next to a lamp). The cartridge in-use must not be stored in a refrigerator.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n403 \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n404 \n\n  \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully, including the Instructions for Use of Insulin Human Winthrop \nBasal SoloStar, pre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. The insulin is present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. It comes in cartridges sealed in \ndisposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n405 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n406 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n407 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nHow to handle SoloStar \n \nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. \n \nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n \nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved \nfor use with SoloStar. \nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n \nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \nmust then be used. \n \nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \nyou think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n408 \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal SoloStar pre-filled pen, \nis not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n \nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n \nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be \ndiscarded and a new SoloStar has to be used. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Basal and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n409 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n413 \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n414 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Basal SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \nInstructions for Use. \n \nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n \nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n \nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n \nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n \nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or \ncall the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \n\nwith SoloStar. \n\u2022 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\u2022 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \n\naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n\u2022 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour \nwill vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below \nare for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \nC. Check the appearance of your insulin.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n415 \n\nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human \nWinthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn \nthe pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance.  \n\n \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \nneedle blocks. \n \nBefore use of needle, carefully read the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d accompanying the needles.  \n \nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle.  \n \nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \n\ndepending on the needle type). \n \n\n . \n \n\n\u2022 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n   \n \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\u2022 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\u2022 removing air bubbles \n \nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n416 \n\n   \n \nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \n\ninner needle cap and discard it.  \n \n\n   \n \nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n   \n \nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  \n \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \n\nremove them. \n\u2022 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \n\nthis SoloStar. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n \nA. Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n \nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \n\nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n \n\n  \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n417 \n\n\u2022 Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. \n \n\u2022 You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \n\ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. \n\n \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n   \n \nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \n\nwill return to \u201c0\u201d as you inject.  \n\n   \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n \nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when \nthe total of 300 units of insulin have been used. \n\n \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached.  \nThis helps prevent: \n\u2022 Contamination and/or infection  \n\u2022 Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n \nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \n\nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.  \n \n\n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \ninfectious diseases. \n\n \nB. Dispose of the needle safely.  \n \nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n418 \n\nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. \nCold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n \n \nMaintenance \n \nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n \nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.  \n \nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it.  \n \nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely.

What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to you doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n420 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n421 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n422 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 15. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed \nfor this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain \nany other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n423 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of \nthis leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n424 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n428 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n429 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n430 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n431 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n432 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 15. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off capon the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n433 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n434 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n438 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15.\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n439 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.

What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n440 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOother medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n441 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n442 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 15. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blodd vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 cartridges are to be used \nonly with the following pens: \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the \ninsulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \nthen be used. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n443 \n\nAlways use a new cartridge must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is \nunexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you \nthink you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n \nProblems with the pen? \n \nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. \nTherefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes \nwhich are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n444 \n\n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n448 \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n449 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled \n\npen \nInsulin human \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully, including the Instructions for Use of Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 15 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15  \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n450 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n451 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n452 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 15. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nHow to handle SoloStar \n \nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. \n \nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n \nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved \nfor use with SoloStar. \nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n \nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \nmust then be used. \n \nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \nyou think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n453 \n\n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 SoloStar, pre-filled \npen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n \nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n \nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be \ndiscarded and a new SoloStar has to be used. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 \n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not know). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n454 \n\n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n458 \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n459 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \nInstructions for Use. \n \nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n \nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n \nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n \nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n \nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or \ncall the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \n\nwith SoloStar. \n\u2022 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\u2022 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \n\naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n\u2022 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour \nwill vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below \nare for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nB.

Turn \nthe pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance.  \n\n \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \nneedle blocks. \n \nBefore use of needle, carefully read the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d accompanying the needles.  \n \nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle.  \n \nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \n\ndepending on the needle type). \n \n\n . \n \n\n\u2022 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n   \n \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\u2022 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\u2022 removing air bubbles \n \nA.

Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n   \n \nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  \n \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \n\nremove them. \n\u2022 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \n\nthis SoloStar. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n \nA. Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n \nB.

Do not force the \n\ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. \n\n \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n   \n \nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \n\nwill return to \u201c0\u201d as you inject.  \n\n   \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n \nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when \nthe total of 300 units of insulin have been used. \n\n \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached.  \nThis helps prevent: \n\u2022 Contamination and/or infection  \n\u2022 Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n \nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \n\nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.  \n \n\n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \ninfectious diseases. \n\n \nB. Dispose of the needle safely.  \n \nC.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n465 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n466 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n467 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 25. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed \nfor this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain \nany other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly \ngetting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you \nmay have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n468 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicine except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can cause side effects, although not everybody \ngets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions caanot be estimated from \navailable data. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n469 \n\n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n473 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n474 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n475 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n476 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n477 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 25. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps \u2013 special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly \ngetting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you \nmay have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n478 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin HumaWinthrop Comb 25 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of \nthis leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailabla data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n479 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n483 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n484 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n485 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n486 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n487 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 25. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges are to be used \nonly with the following pens: \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the \ninsulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \nthen be used. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n488 \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n \nProblems with the pen? \n \nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. \nTherefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes \nwhich are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n489 \n\n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.  \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \ncartridge after \u201cEXP\u201d.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n493 \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n494 \n\n  \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled \n\npen \nInsulin human \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully, including the Instructions for Use of Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 25 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25  \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n495 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n496 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n497 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 25. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel).  \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nHow to handle SoloStar \n \nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. \n \nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n \nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved \nfor use with SoloStar. \nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n \nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \nmust then be used. \n \nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \nyou think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n498 \n\n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 SoloStar, pre-filled \npen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n \nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n \nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be \ndiscarded and a new SoloStar has to be used. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.

If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n503 \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n504 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Solostar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \nInstructions for Use. \n \nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n \nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n \nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n \nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n \nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or \ncall the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \n\nwith SoloStar. \n\u2022 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\u2022 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \n\naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n\u2022 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour \nwill vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below \nare for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \nC.

Turn \nthe pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance.  \n\n \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \nneedle blocks. \n \nBefore use of needle, carefully read the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d accompanying the needles.  \n \nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle.  \n \nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \n\ndepending on the needle type). \n \n\n . \n \n\n\u2022 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n   \n \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\u2022 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\u2022 removing air bubbles \n \nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n506 \n\n   \n \nB.

Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n   \n \nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  \n \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \n\nremove them. \n\u2022 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \n\nthis SoloStar. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n \nA. Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n \nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \n\nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n507 \n\n\u2022 Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. \n \n\u2022 You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \n\ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. \n\n \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n   \n \nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \n\nwill return to \u201c0\u201d as you inject.  \n\n   \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n \nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when \nthe total of 300 units of insulin have been used. \n\n \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached.  \nThis helps prevent: \n\u2022 Contamination and/or infection  \n\u2022 Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n \nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \n\nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.  \n \n\n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \ninfectious diseases. \n\n \nB. Dispose of the needle safely.  \n \nC.

You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n511 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n512 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 30. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed \nfor this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain \nany other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly \ngetting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you \nmay have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n513 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 30 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 30 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n514 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n518 \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n519 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n520 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n521 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n522 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 30. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges are to be used \nonly with the following pens: \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the \ninsulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \nthen be used. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n523 \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n \nProblems with the pen? \n \nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. \nTherefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes \nwhich are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 30 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 30 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n524 \n\n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \ncartridge after \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened cartridges \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n528 \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n-  you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n529 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled \n\npen \nInsulin human \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully, including the Instructions for Use of Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 30 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of \naction. It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30  \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n530 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n531 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n532 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 30. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel).  \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nHow to handle SoloStar \n \nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. \n \nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n \nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved \nfor use with SoloStar. \nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n \nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \nmust then be used. \n \nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \nyou think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n533 \n\n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar, pre-filled \npen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n \nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n \nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be \ndiscarded and a new SoloStar has to be used. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 30 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 30 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n534 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n538 \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n2. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n539 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \nInstructions for Use. \n \nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n \nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n \nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n \nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n \nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurseor \ncall the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \n\nwith SoloStar. \n\u2022 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\u2022 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \n\naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n\u2022 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nA Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human \nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary \nbased on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for \nillustrative purposes only. \n \nB Take off the pen cap. \n \nC Check the appearance of your insulin.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n540 \n\nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human \nWinthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn \nthe pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance.  \n\n \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \nneedle blocks. \n \nBefore use of needle, carefully read the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d accompanying the needles.  \n \nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nA Remove the protective seal from a new needle.  \n \nB Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \ndepending on the needle type). \n \n\n . \n \n\n\u2022 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n   \n \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test  \n \nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\u2022 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\u2022 removing air bubbles \n \nA Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n541 \n\n   \n \nB Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off \nthe inner needle cap and discard it.  \n \n\n   \n \nC Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \nD Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nE Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n   \n \nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  \n \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \n\nremove them. \n\u2022 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \n\nthis SoloStar. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n \nA Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n \nB Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn \npast your dose, you can turn back down. \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n542 \n\n\u2022 Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. \n \n\u2022 You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \n\ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. \n\n \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nA Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nB Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n   \n \nC Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose \nwindow will return to \u201c0\u201d as you inject.  \n\n   \n \n\nD Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when \nthe total of 300 units of insulin have been used. \n\n \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached.  \nThis helps prevent: \n\u2022 Contamination and/or infection  \n\u2022 Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n \nA Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.  \n\n \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \n\nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \ninfectious diseases. \n\n \nB Dispose of the needle safely.  \n \nC Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n543 \n\nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. \nCold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n \n \nMaintenance \n \nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n \nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.  \n \nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it.  \n \nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long \nduration of action.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n545 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n546 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:  \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n547 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 50. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps \u2013 special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed \nfor this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain \nany other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n548 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n549 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n553 \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n554 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long \nduration of action.  \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n555 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n556 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:  \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n557 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 50. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps \u2013 special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for \nthis insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any \nother medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n \nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. \n \nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n \nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n558 \n\nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those \nspecially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins \nor insulin analogues. \n \nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. \nInject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU \nper ml and 40 IU per ml). \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n559 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n563 \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n564 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.

You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n566 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:  \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n567 \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 50. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \nuse in such devices. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges are to be used \nonly with the following pens: \n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  \n- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  \n \nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the \ninsulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \nthen be used. \n \nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n568 \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n-  \n-  \n \nProblems with the pen? \n \nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \nIf the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. \nTherefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes \nwhich are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin HumaWinthrop Comb 50 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n569 \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \ncartridge after \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened cartridges \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next \nto the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect \nfrom light. \n \nIn-use cartridges \nCartridges in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks \nnot above 25\u00b0C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct \nsunlight or next to a lamp). The cartridge in-use must not be stored in a refrigerator. Do not use the \ncartridge after this time period. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n570 \n\n \n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n573 \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n574 \n\n  \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled \n\npen \nInsulin human \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully, including the Instructions for Use of Insulin Human Winthrop \nComb 50 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long \nduration of action. It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes \nmellitus who need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse befor using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n575 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n576 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:  \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50  \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n577 \n\n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop \n\nComb 50. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n \nDo NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein. \n \nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \ndoses. \n \nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n \nHow to handle SoloStar \n \nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. \n \nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n \nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved \nfor use with SoloStar. \nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n \nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \nimmediately before each injection. \n \nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n \nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \nmust then be used. \n \nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \nyou think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n578 \n\n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar, pre-filled \npen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n \nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n \nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be \ndiscarded and a new SoloStar has to be used. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, your blood sugar level \n\nmay become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to \nprevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information \non the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n579 \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 peopel) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \" Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n583 \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \" Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n584 \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. \nInstructions for Use. \n \nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n \nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n \nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n \nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n \nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n \nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or \ncall the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n \nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n \n\u2022 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \n\nwith SoloStar. \n\u2022 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\u2022 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \n\naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\u2022 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n\u2022 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n \nStep 1. Check the insulin \n \nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour \nwill vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below \nare for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \nC. Check the appearance of your insulin.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n585 \n\nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human \nWinthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn \nthe pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an \nevenly milky-white appearance.  \n\n \n \nStep 2. Attach the needle \n \nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \nneedle blocks. \n \nBefore use of needle, carefully read the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d accompanying the needles. \n \nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \n\ndepending on the needle type). \n \n\n  \n \n\u2022 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \n\nleakage, or break the needle. \n \n\n   \n \n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n \nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\u2022 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\u2022 removing air bubbles \n \nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n586 \n\n   \n \nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \n\ninner needle cap and discard it.  \n \n\n   \n \nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n   \n \nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \n\nremove them. \n\u2022 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\u2022 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \n\nthis SoloStar. \n \nStep 4. Select the dose \n \nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n \nA. Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n \nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \n\nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n587 \n\n\u2022 Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. \n \n\u2022 You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \n\ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. \n\n \n \nStep 5. Inject the dose \n \nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n   \n \nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \n\nwill return to \u201c0\u201d as you inject.  \n\n   \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n \nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when \nthe total of 300 units of insulin have been used. \n\n \n \nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n \nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \nThis helps prevent: \n\u2022 Contamination and/or infection \n\u2022 Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n \nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \n\nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n \n\n\u2022 If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \ninfectious diseases. \n\n \nB. Dispose of the needle safely.  \n \nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n588 \n\nStorage instructions  \n \nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n \nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. \nCold insulin is more painful to inject. \n \nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n \n \nMaintenance \n \nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n \nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n \nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n \nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat. \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n590 \n\nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n591 \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \n \n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n592 \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat per day you will need, how much of this \n\nis infused continuously (\"basal rate\") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an \n\"insulin boost\" (\"bolus dose\"), \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a solution to be given under the skin. \n \nYour doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how \noften you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the \ninsulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in \nwhich you must not start or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for \nthese pumps. \n \nHow to handle the vials \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat has been developed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron. It must \nonly be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene \ncatheters must be used for infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump will tell you how \nto use it. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid \nparticles visible, and has a water-like consistency. \n \nThe insulin cartridge of the pump must be sterile and must be used once only. After filling the \ncartridge of the pump keep it at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before using it, so that you can see \nand remove any air bubbles which form during warming-up. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other \ndisinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must NOT be mixed \nwith any other insulin preparations. \n \nInsulin pump faults \n \nYou should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired \nblood sugar levels, \n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at larger doses or more often than usual, or \n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at smaller doses or less often than usual. \n \nFor details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual. \n \nIf the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection \nsyringe for injection. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n593 \n\nonly those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International \nUnits) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Infusat without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Infusat and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n594 \n\nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n598 \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that \n\nyou are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes \nor a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial \nsweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n599 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is and what it is used for \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a \nbiotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \nIt comes in cartridges designed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron (insulin pumps). \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus \nwho need treatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce \nenough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse beforing using Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \nFollow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n \nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n \nSpecial patient groups \nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n600 \n\n \nTravel \nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nIllnesses and injuries \nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n \nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and \ncontinue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that \nyou require insulin. \n \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nOther medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels \nthat are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \naction, if any, you need to take. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:  \n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),  \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),  \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),  \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:  \n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n601 \n\n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:  \n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nBetablockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:  \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight.  \nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \n \n3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n \nDose \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n602 \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n- determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat per day you will need, how much of this \n\nis infused continuously (\"basal rate\") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an \n\"insulin boost\" (\"bolus dose\"), \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat. \n \nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a solution to be given under the skin. \n \nYour doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how \noften you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the \ninsulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. \n \nDo not use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in \nwhich you must not start or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for \nthese pumps. \n \nHow to handle the cartridges \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat comes in cartridges designed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron. \nIt must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene or \npolyethylene catheters must be used for infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump will \ntell you how to use it. \n \nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid \nparticles visible, and has a water-like consistency. \n \nKeep the cartridge at room temperature 1 to 2 hours before inserting it in the pump so that you can see \nand remove any air bubbles which form during warming-up. \n \nSpecial care before injection \n \nBefore starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other \ndisinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n \nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must NOT be mixed \nwith any other insulin preparations. \n \nDo not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n \nInsulin pump faults \n \nYou should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired \nblood sugar levels, \n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at larger doses or more often than usual, or \n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at smaller doses or less often than usual. \n \nFor details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual. \n \nIf the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection \nsyringe for injection. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n603 \n\nonly those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International \nUnits) per ml. \n \nIf you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat than you should \n- If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat, your blood sugar level may \n\nbecome too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent \nhypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the \ntreatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \n- If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat or if you have not injected \n\nenough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your \nblood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid \nin the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human \nWinthrop Infusat without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nInsulin Mix-ups \n \nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin \nHuman Winthrop Infusat and other insulins.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack \nor brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood \nsugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nSevere allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); \nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from \navailable data. \n \nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Oedema \nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \nankles. \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) \n\u2022 Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n604 \n\nOther side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)  \n\u2022 Sodium retention \n\u2022 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\u2022 Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the \ninjection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. \n\u2022 Skin and allergic reactions \nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a \nfew weeks. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n \nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n607 \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n \nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n \nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). \n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n \n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n \n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n \nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if \n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human \n\nWinthrop, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). \n \nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n608 \n\ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n \n1. Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that \n\nyou are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes \nor a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial \nsweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

when you start or stop taking another medicine. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: - all other medicines to treat diabetes, - angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), - disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), - fluoxetine (used to treat depression), - fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), - monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used to treat depression), - pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used

always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will - determine how much insulin human winthrop rapid per day you will need, - tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, - tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of insulin human winthrop rapid. many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. frequency of administration insulin human winthrop rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. method of administration insulin human winthrop rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein (blood vessel). your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. with each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions. for these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting. do not use insulin human winthrop rapid in insulin pumps special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. how to handle the vials insulin human winthrop rapid contains 100 iu insulin per ml. only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 iu per ml) must be used. the injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. insulin human winthrop rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency. do not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. special care before injection before injection remove any air bubbles. make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below. insulin human winthrop rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, except those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. also, it must not be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. if you need to inject a mixture, draw insulin human winthrop rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. inject as soon as you have mixed them. do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 iu per ml and 40 iu per ml). if you use more insulin human winthrop rapid than you should - if you have injected too much insulin human winthrop rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. if you forget to use insulin human winthrop rapid - if you have missed a dose of insulin human winthrop rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. for information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. - do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop using insulin human winthrop rapid this could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). do not stop insulin human winthrop rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. insulin mix-ups you must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between insulin human winthrop rapid and other insulins.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "insulin human

of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data. side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) oedema insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. injection site reactions 334 side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) injection site urticaria (itchy rash) other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) sodium retention eye reactions a marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. if you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) if you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. skin and allergic reactions other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. they can also spread around the injection site. most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). however, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "insulin human winthrop", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
