NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nAerinaze 2.5 mg/120 mg modified-release tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 2.5 mg desloratadine and 120 mg pseudoephedrine sulphate. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nModified-release tablet.\nBlue and white bilayer oval tablet with \u201cD12\u201d branded to blue layer.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAerinaze is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older for the symptomatic treatment of \nseasonal allergic rhinitis when accompanied by nasal congestion. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet twice a day. \n\nThe recommended dosage and the duration of treatment should not be exceeded.\n\nThe duration of treatment should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the \nsymptoms have disappeared. It is advisable to limit treatment to about 10 days, as during chronic \nadministration the activity of pseudoephedrine sulphate may diminish. After improvement of the \ncongestive condition of the mucosae of the upper airway, treatment may be maintained with \ndesloratadine alone, if necessary.\n\nElderly patients\nPatients of 60 years or older are more likely to experience adverse reactions to sympathomimetic \nmedicinal products, such as pseudoephedrine sulphate. The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not \nbeen established in this population, and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose \nrecommendations. Therefore Aerinaze should be used with caution in patients above 60 years of age.\n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been established in patients with impaired renal or \nhepatic function, and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations. Aerinaze is \nnot recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Aerinaze in children below the age of 12 years have not been established.\nNo data are available. Aerinaze is not recommended for use in children below the age of 12 years.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nThe tablet may be taken with a full glass of water but must be swallowed entirely (without crushing, \nbreaking or chewing it). The tablet may be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to adrenergic \nmedicinal products or to loratadine. \n\nAs Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine sulphate, it is also contraindicated in patients who are \nreceiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or during the 2 weeks following the stopping \nof such treatment.\n\nAerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with:\n\uf0b7 narrow-angle glaucoma,\n\uf0b7 urinary retention, \n\uf0b7 cardiovascular diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe \n\nhypertension,\n\uf0b7 hyperthyroidism,\n\uf0b7 a history of haemorrhagic stroke or with risk factors which could increase the risk of \n\nhaemorrhagic stroke. This is due to the alpha-mimetic activity of pseudoephedrine sulphate in \ncombination with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitine, pergolide, lisuride, \ncabergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or any other decongestant medicinal product used \nas a nasal decongestant, either by oral route or by nasal route (phenylpropanolamine, \nphenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline\u2026). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCardiovascular and general effects\nPatients should be informed that the treatment should be discontinued in case of hypertension, \ntachycardia, palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological sign (such as \nheadache or increased headache).\n\nCaution should be exercised in the following patient groups:\n\uf0b7 Patients with cardiac arrhythmias\n\uf0b7 Patients with hypertension\n\uf0b7 Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction, or \n\npositive anamnesis of bronchospasm\n\uf0b7 Patients receiving digitalis (see section 4.5)\n\nGastrointestinal and genitourinary effects\nUse with caution in patients with stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and obstruction \nof the vesical cervix.\n\nCentral nervous system effects\nCaution should also be exercised in patients being treated with other sympathomimetics (see \nsection 4.5). These include:\n\uf0b7 decongestants\n\uf0b7 anorexogenics or amphetamine-type psychostimulants\n\uf0b7 antihypertensive medicinal products\n\uf0b7 tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients suffering from migraine who are currently being treated with \nergot alkaloid vasoconstrictors (see section 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nConvulsions\nDesloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of \nseizures, and mainly young children, being more susceptible to develop new seizures under \ndesloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in patients \nwho experience a seizure while on treatment.\n\nCentral nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying \nhypotension may be produced by sympathomimetic amines. These effects may be more likely to occur \nin adolescents from 12 years old, elderly patients, or in cases of overdose (see section 4.9).\n\nRisks of abuse\nPseudoephedrine sulphate carries the risk of abuse. Increased doses may ultimately produce toxicity. \nContinuous use can lead to tolerance resulting in an increased risk of overdosing. Depression may \nfollow rapid withdrawal.\n\nOther\nPerioperative acute hypertension can occur if volatile halogenated anaesthetics are used during \ntreatment with indirect sympathomimetic agents. Therefore, if surgery is scheduled, it is preferable to \ndiscontinue treatment 24 hours before anaesthesia.\n\nInterference with serological testing\nAthletes should be informed that treatment with pseudoephedrine sulphate could lead to positive \ndoping tests.\n\nThe administration of Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours before skin tests since \nantihistamines maybe prevent or reduce otherwise positive reaction to dermal reactivity index.\n\nSevere skin reactions\nSevere skin reactions such as acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) may occur with \npseudoephedrine-containing products. Patients should be carefully monitored. If signs and symptoms \nsuch as pyrexia, erythema or many small pustules are observed, administration of Aerinaze should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate measures taken if needed.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAerinaze\nThe following combinations are not recommended:\n\uf0b7 digitalis (see section 4.4)\n\uf0b7 bromocriptine\n\uf0b7 cabergoline\n\uf0b7 lisuride, pergolide: risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed with the combination of desloratadine and \npseudoephedrine sulphate.\n\nThe interaction with Aerinaze and alcohol has not been studied. However, in a clinical pharmacology \ntrial desloratadine taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the performance impairing \neffects of alcohol. No significant differences were found in the psychomotor test results between \ndesloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or with alcohol. Alcohol use should be \navoided during Aerinaze treatment.\n\nDesloratadine\nNo clinically relevant interactions or changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed \nin clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered. \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nThe enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and \ntherefore, some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine \ndoes not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not \ninhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.\n\nPseudoephedrine sulphate\nAntacids increase the rate of pseudoephedrine sulphate absorption, kaolin decreases it.\n\nSympathomimetics\nReversible and irreversible MAO inhibitor(s) may cause: risk of vasoconstriction and increased blood \npressure. \n\nConcurrent administration with other sympathomimetics (decongestants, anorexogenics or \namphetamine-type psychostimulants, antihypertensive medicinal products, tricyclic antidepressants \nand other antihistamines) may result in critical hypertension reactions (see section 4.4).\n\nDihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrine: risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood \npressure.\n\nOther vasoconstrictors used as nasal decongestant, by oral or nasal route (phenylpropanolamine, \nphenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline\u2026): risk of vasoconstriction.\n\nSympathomimetic medicines reduce the antihypertensive effect of \u03b1-methyldopa, mecamylamine, \nreserpine, veratrum alkaloids, and guanethidine.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of the \ncombination of desloratadine and pseudoephedrine sulphate in pregnant women. Animal studies do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nDesloratadine and pseudoephedrine sulphate have been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of \ntreated women. There is insufficient information on the effects of desloratadine and pseudoephedrine \nsulphate in newborns/infants. Decreased milk production in nursing mothers has been reported with \npseudoephedrine sulphate. Aerinaze should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data available on male and female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAerinaze has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \ninformed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as there is individual variation in \nresponse to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are advised not to engage in activities \nrequiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, until they have established their own \nresponse to the medicinal product.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials involving 414 adults the most frequent of adverse reactions reported were insomnia \n(8.9 %), dry mouth (7.2 %) and headache (3.1 %). \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to Aerinaze are listed below by \nSystem Organ Class. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with Aerinaze\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nCommon\n\nUncommon\n\nDecreased appetite\n\nThirst, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common\n\nUncommon\n\nInsomnia, somnolence, sleep disorder, \nnervousness\nAgitation, anxiety, irritability\n\nNervous system disorders Common\n\nUncommon\n\nDizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity \n\nHyperkinesia, confusional state\n\nEye disorders Uncommon Vision blurred, dry eye\n\nCardiac disorders Common\n\nUncommon\n\nTachycardia\n\nPalpitation, supraventricular extrasystoles\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCommon \n\nUncommon\n\nPharyngitis\n\nRhinitis, sinusitis, epistaxis, nasal discomfort, \nrhinorrhea, dry throat, hyposmia\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common\n\nUncommon\n\nConstipation\n\nDyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, \ngastroenteritis, abnormal faeces\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Pruritus\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon Dysuria, micturition disorder\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon\n\nUncommon\n\nHeadache, fatigue, dry mouth\n\nChills, flushing, hot flush\n\nInvestigations Uncommon Hepatic enzymes increased\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nOther adverse reactions reported for desloratadine during the post-marketing period are listed \nhereunder.\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions\n\nImmune system disorders Very rare Hypersensitivity (such as anaphylaxis, \nangioedema, dyspnoea, pruritus, rash, and \nurticaria)\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nNot known Increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders Very rare\n\nNot known\n\nHallucination\n\nAbnormal behaviour, aggression\nNervous system disorders Very rare Convulsion\n\nCardiac disorders Not known QT prolongation\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very rare Vomiting, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very rare Hepatitis\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nVery rare Myalgia\n\nInvestigations Very rare\n\nNot known\n\nBlood bilirubin increased \n\nWeight increased\n\nCases of severe skin reactions such as acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been \nreported with pseudoephedrine-containing products.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of overdose are mostly of a sympathomimetic nature. Symptoms may vary from CNS \ndepression (sedation, apnoea, diminished mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) \nto CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucination, tremors, convulsions) with possible fatal outcome. Other \nsymptoms may include: headache, anxiety, micturition difficulty, muscle weakness and tenseness, \neuphoria, excitement, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, \nperspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and \nhypertension or hypotension. CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as are atropine-like \nsymptoms (dry mouth, fixed and dilated pupils, flushing, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal \nsymptoms). Some patients may present a toxic psychosis with delusions and hallucinations.\n\nManagement\nIn the event of overdose, symptomatic and supportive treatment immediately should be started and \nmaintained it for as long as necessary. Adsorption of active substance remaining in the stomach may \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nbe attempted by administration of active charcoal suspended in water. Gastric lavage with physiologic \nsaline solution may be performed, particularly in children. In adults, tap water can be used. As much \nas possible of the amount administered should be removed before the next instillation. Desloratadine \nis not removed by haemodialysis and it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis. After \nemergency treatment, medical monitoring of the patient should be continued.\n\nTreatment of the pseudoephedrine sulphate overdose is symptomatic and supportive. Stimulants \n(analeptics) must not be used. Hypertension can be controlled with an adrenoceptor-blocking agent \nand tachycardia with a beta-blocking agent. Short acting barbiturates, diazepam or paraldehyde may \nbe administered to control seizures. Hyperpyrexia, especially in children, may require treatment with \ntepid water sponge baths or hypothermia blanket. Apnoea is treated with respiratory assistance.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Nasal preparations, nasal decongestants for systemic use, ATC code: \nR01BA52.\n\nMechanism of action\nDesloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-\nreceptor antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral \nhistamine H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system.\n\nDesloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting \nthe release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast \ncells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on \nendothelial cells. \n\nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In a single dose study performed \nin adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance including \nexacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying. In controlled clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to\nplacebo. Desloratadine given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance \nin clinical trials. \n\nPseudoephedrine sulphate (d-isoephedrine sulphate) is a sympathomimetic agent with mostly \uf061-\nmimetic activity in comparison with the \uf062-activity. Pseudoephedrine sulphate provides a nasal \ndecongestant effect after oral administration due to its vasoconstrictive action. It has an indirect \nsympathomimetic effect due primarily to the release of adrenergic mediators from the post-ganglionic \nnerve endings.\n\nOral administration of pseudoephedrine sulphate at the recommended dose can cause other \nsympathomimetic effects, such as increased blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of central \nnervous system excitation.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nThe pharmacodynamic effects of Aerinaze tablets are directly related to that of its components.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Aerinaze tablets was evaluated in two, 2-week multicentre, \nrandomized parallel group clinical trials involving 1,248 patients 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal \nallergic rhinitis, 414 of whom received Aerinaze tablets. In both trials, the antihistaminic efficacy of \nAerinaze tablets as measured by total symptom score, excluding nasal congestion, was significantly \ngreater than pseudoephedrine sulphate alone over the 2-week treatment period. In addition, the \n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\ndecongestant efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, as measured by nasal stuffiness/congestion, was \nsignificantly greater than desloratadine alone over the 2-week treatment period.\n\nThere were no significant differences in the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets across subgroups of patients \ndefined by gender, age, or race.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\n- Desloratadine and Pseudoephedrine sulphate:\n\nAbsorption\nIn a single dose pharmacokinetic study with Aerinaze, plasma concentration of desloratadine can be \ndetected within 30 minutes of administration. The mean time to maximum plasma concentrations \n(Tmax) for desloratadine occurred at approximately 4-5 hours post dose and mean peak plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of approximately \n1.09 ng/ml and 31.6 ng\u2022hr/ml, respectively, were observed. For pseudoephedrine sulphate, the mean \nTmax occurred at 6-7 hours post dose and mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) of \napproximately 263 ng/ml and 4,588 ng\u2022hr/ml, respectively, were observed. Food had no effect on the \nbioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine or pseudoephedrine sulphate. The half-life for \ndesloratadine is 27.4 hours. The apparent half-life of pseudoephedrine sulphate is 7.9 hours.\n\nFollowing oral administration of Aerinaze for 14 days in normal healthy volunteers, steady-state \nconditions were reached on day 10 for desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine\nsulphate. For desloratadine, mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC (0-12 h)) of \napproximately 1.7 ng/ml and 16 ng\u2022hr/ml were observed, respectively. For pseudoephedrine sulphate, \nmean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC (0-12 h)) of 459 ng/ml and \n4,658 ng\u2022hr/ml were observed.\n\n- Desloratadine \n\nAbsorption\nIn a series of pharmacokinetic and clinical trials, 6 % of the subjects reached a higher concentration of \ndesloratadine. The prevalence of this poor metabolizer phenotype was greater among Black adults \nthan Caucasian adults (18 % vs. 2 %) however the safety profile of these subjects was not different \nfrom that of the general population. In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the \ntablet formulation in healthy adult subjects, four subjects were found to be poor metabolisers of \ndesloratadine. These subjects had a Cmax concentration about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours \nwith a terminal phase half-life of approximately 89 hours.\n\nDistribution\nDesloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins.\n\n- Pseudoephedrine sulphate\n\nAbsorption\nA component interaction study demonstrated that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine\nsulphate following administration of pseudoephedrine sulphate alone was bioequivalent to \npseudoephedrine sulphate exposure following administration of the Aerinaze tablet. Therefore \nabsorption of pseudoephedrine sulphate was not affected by the Aerinaze formulation.\n\nDistribution\nPseudoephedrine sulphate is presumed to cross the placenta and the haematoencephalic barrier.\n\nThe active substance is excreted in breast milk of breast-feeding women.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nElimination\nIts elimination half-life in humans, at an approximate urinary pH of 6, ranges from 5 to 8 hours. The \nactive substance and its metabolite are excreted in urine; 55-75 % of the administered dose is excreted \nunchanged. The rate of excretion is accelerated and the duration of action decreased in acidic urine \n(pH5). In case of alkalinisation of the urine, a partial resorption takes place.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNo pre-clinical studies have been performed with Aerinaze. However, non-clinical data with \ndesloratadine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction\nand development. \n\nThe lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with desloratadine and \nloratadine.\n\nThe combination of loratadine/pseudoephedrine sulphate used in acute and multiple-dose studies, \nexhibited a low order of toxicity. The combination was not more toxic than their individual \ncomponents, and observed effects were generally related to the pseudoephedrine sulphate component.\n\nDuring reproductive toxicity studies, the combination of loratadine/pseudoephedrine sulphate was not \nteratogenic when administered orally to rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day and rabbits at doses up to \n120 mg/kg/day. \n\n6.

What Aerinaze is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Aerinaze is\nAerinaze tablets contain a combination of two active ingredients, desloratadine which is an \nantihistamine and pseudoephedrine sulphate which is a decongestant. \n\nHow Aerinaze works\nAntihistamines help to reduce allergic symptoms by preventing the effects of a substance called \nhistamine, which is produced by the body. Decongestants help to clear nasal congestion\n(blocked/stuffy nose).\n\nWhen Aerinaze should be used\nAerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as, \nsneezing, runny or itchy nose, and eyes, when accompanied by nasal congestion in adults and \nadolescents 12 years of age and older.\n\n2.
