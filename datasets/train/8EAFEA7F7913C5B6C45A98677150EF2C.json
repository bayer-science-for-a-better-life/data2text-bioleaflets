NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nRebetol 200 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains 200 mg of ribavirin.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach hard capsule contains 40 mg of lactose monohydrate.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule (capsule)\n\nWhite, opaque and imprinted with blue ink.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRebetol is indicated in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) in adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). \n\nRebetol is indicated in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) for paediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents) not \npreviously treated and without liver decompensation (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated, and monitored, by a physician experienced in the management of \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\n\nRebetol must be used in combination therapy as described in section 4.1.\nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of medicinal products \nused in combination with Rebetol for additional prescribing information particular to that product and \nfor further dosage recommendations on co-administration with Rebetol.\n\nRebetol capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses (morning and evening) \nwith food. \n\nAdults\nThe recommended dose and duration of Rebetol depends on patient\u2019s weight and on the medicinal \nproduct that is used in combination. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products\nused in combination with Rebetol.\n\nIn the cases in which no specific dose recommendation is made, the following dose should be used: \nPatient weight: < 75 kg =1,000 mg and > 75 kg = 1,200 mg.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nPaediatric population\nNo data are available in children below 3 years of age.\n\nNote: For patients who weigh < 47 kg, or are unable to swallow capsules, please refer to the SmPC for \nRebetol 40 mg/mL oral solution.\n\nDosing of Rebetol for children and adolescent patients is determined by the patient body weight. For \nexample, the body weight dosing used in conjunction with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b \nis shown in Table 1. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in \ncombination with Rebetol as some combination regimens do not adhere to the Rebetol dosing \nguidance provided in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 Rebetol dose based on body weight when used in combination with interferon alfa-2b or \npeginterferon alfa-2b in paediatric patients\n\nPatient weight (kg) Daily Rebetol dose Number of 200 mg capsules\n47 - 49 600 mg 3 capsules a\n\n50 - 65 800 mg 4 capsules b\n\n> 65 Refer to adult dose recommendations\na1 morning, 2 evening\nb2 morning, 2 evening\n\nDose modification for adverse reactions\n\nDose modification for adults\nDose reduction of Rebetol depends on the initial Rebetol posology which depends on the medicinal \nproduct that is used in combination with Rebetol.\n\nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to Rebetol, the Rebetol dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity.\n\nTable 2 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s \nhaemoglobin concentration, cardiac status and indirect bilirubin concentration.\n\nTable 2 Management of Adverse Reactions\nLaboratory values Reduce Rebetol dose*\n\nif:\nDiscontinue\nRebetol if:\n\nHaemoglobin in patients with \nNo Cardiac Disease\n\n< 10 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL\n\nHaemoglobin: Patients with \nHistory of Stable Cardiac \nDisease\n\n\uf0b3 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any\n\n4 week period during treatment \n(permanent dose reduction)\n\n< 12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose\n\nBilirubin \u2013 Indirect > 5 mg/dL > 4 mg/dL (adults)\n\n* For patients receiving a 1,000 mg (< 75 kg) or 1,200 mg (> 75 kg) dose, Rebetol dose should be \nreduced to 600 mg/day (administered as one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules\nin the evening). If the abnormality is reversed, Rebetol may be restarted at 600 mg daily, and further \nincreased to 800 mg daily at the discretion of the treating physician. However, a return to higher doses \nis not recommended.\nFor patients receiving a 800 mg (< 65 kg)-1,000 mg (65-80 kg)-1,200 mg (81-105 kg) or 1,400 mg \n(> 105 kg) dose, 1st dose reduction of Rebetol is by 200 mg/day (except in patients receiving the \n1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, 2nd dose reduction of Rebetol is by an \nadditional 200 mg/day. Patients whose dose of Rebetol is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg \ncapsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules in the evening.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nIn case of serious adverse reaction potentially related to medicinal products used in combination with \nRebetol, refer to the corresponding SmPC of these medicinal products as some combination regimens \ndo not adhere to the Rebetol dose modification and/or discontinuation guidelines as described in \nTable 2.\n\nDose modification for paediatric patients\nDose reduction in paediatric patients without cardiac disease follows the same guidelines as adult \npatients without cardiac disease regarding haemoglobin levels (Table 2).\n\nThere are no data for paediatric patients with cardiac disease (see section 4.4).\n\nTable 3 provides guidelines for discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s indirect bilirubin \nconcentration.\n\nTable 3 Management of Adverse Reactions\nLaboratory values Discontinue Rebetol if: \nBilirubin \u2013 Indirect > 5 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks)\n\n(children and adolescents treated with interferon alfa-2b),\nor\n\n> 4 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks)\n(children and adolescents treated with peginterferon alfa-2b)\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 65 years of age)\nThere does not appear to be a significant age-related effect on the pharmacokinetics of Rebetol. \nHowever, as in younger patients, renal function must be determined prior to administration of Rebetol\n(see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents)\nRebetol may be used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b (see section 4.4). \nThe selection of Rebetol formulation is based on individual characteristics of the patient. \nThe safety and efficacy of ribavirin used together with direct-acting-anti-virals in these patients has \nnot been established. No data are available.\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with Rebetol for \nfurther dosage recommendations on co-administration.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rebetol is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent creatinine clearance in these patients (see section 5.2). Therefore, it is recommended that \nrenal function be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of Rebetol. Adult patients with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/minute) should be administered alternating daily \ndoses of 200 mg and 400 mg. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of \n< 30 mL/minute) and patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or on haemodialysis should be \nadministered Rebetol 200 mg/day. Table 4 provides guidelines for dose modification for patients with \nrenal dysfunction. Patients with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with \nrespect to the development of anaemia. No data are available regarding dose modification for \npaediatric patients with renal impairment.\n\nTable 4 Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment in Adult Patients\nCreatinine Clearance Rebetol Dose (daily)\n30 to 50 mL/min Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day\nLess than 30 mL/min 200 mg daily\nHaemodialysis (ESRD) 200 mg daily\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction appears between Rebetol and hepatic function (see section 5.2). For \nuse in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, see the corresponding SmPC of the medicinal products \nused in combination with Rebetol.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nRebetol should be administered orally with food. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Pregnancy (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3). In females of childbearing potential, Rebetol must not \n\nbe initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to \ninitiation of therapy.\n\n- Breast-feeding.\n- History of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease, \n\nin the previous six months (see section 4.4).\n- Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia).\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with Rebetol for \ncontraindications specific to these products.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRebetol must be used in combination with other medicinal products (see section 5.1).\n\nPlease refer to the SmPC of (peg)interferon alfa for details on the recommendations of monitoring and \nmanagement regarding the adverse reactions listed below before initiating therapy and other \nprecautions associated with (peg)interferon alfa.\n\nThere are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of Rebetol with \n(peg)interferon alfa. These include:\n- Severe psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal ideation, \n\nattempted suicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.)\n- Growth inhibition in children and adolescents that may be irreversible in some patients\n- Increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in children and adolescents\n- Severe ocular disorders\n- Dental and periodontal disorders.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nWhen deciding not to defer combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \nuntil adulthood, it is important to consider that this combination therapy induced a growth inhibition \nthat may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case.\n\nHaemolysis\n\nA decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/dL was observed in up to 14 % of adult patients and 7 % of \nchildren and adolescents treated with Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b in clinical trials. Although Rebetol has no direct cardiovascular effects, anaemia associated with \nRebetol may result in deterioration of cardiac function, or exacerbation of the symptoms of coronary \ndisease, or both. Thus, Rebetol must be administered with caution to patients with pre-existing cardiac \ndisease (see section 4.3). Cardiac status must be assessed before start of therapy and monitored clinically \nduring therapy; if any deterioration occurs, therapy must be stopped (see section 4.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nCardiovascular\n\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have \npre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of \ntreatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but \nmay require discontinuation of therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of \ncardiac disease.\n\nTeratogenic risk\n\nPrior to initiation of treatment with Rebetol the physician must comprehensively inform both male \nand female patients of the teratogenic risk of Rebetol, the necessity of effective and continuous \ncontraception, the possibility that contraceptive methods may fail and the possible consequences of \npregnancy should it occur during or following treatment with Rebetol (see section 4.6). For laboratory \nmonitoring of pregnancy, please refer to Laboratory tests.\n\nAcute hypersensitivity\n\nIf an acute hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) \ndevelops, Rebetol must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy instituted. \nTransient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.\n\nLiver function\n\nAny patient developing significant liver function abnormalities during treatment must be monitored \nclosely. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with \nRebetol for discontinuation or dose modification recommendations.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rebetol is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent clearance in these patients. Therefore, it is recommended that renal function be evaluated in \nall patients prior to initiation of Rebetol. Due to substantial increases in ribavirin plasma \nconcentrations in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, Rebetol dose adjustments are \nrecommended in adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute. No data are available \nregarding dose modification for paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\nHaemoglobin concentrations should be monitored closely during treatment and corrective action taken \nas necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nPotential to exacerbate immunosuppression\n\nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to \n7 weeks after the administration of a peginterferon and Rebetol concomitantly with azathioprine. This \nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infection\n\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:\nCaution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon \nalfa/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should \ncarefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when Rebetol is administered. \nFor additional details see section 4.5.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) may \nbe at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Other baseline factors in co-infected \npatients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with \ndidanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentrations.\nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC \nof medicinal products used in combination with Rebetol for discontinuation or dose modification \nrecommendations. Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis \ntreatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.\n\nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and cART may be \nat increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be \nmanaged by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in \nthis population of patients (see section 4.2 and below \u201cLaboratory tests\u201d and section 4.8). \nPatients treated with Rebetol and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, \nthe concomitant use of Rebetol with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with low CD4 counts\nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/\u00b5L. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \npatients with low CD4 counts.\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with Rebetol.\n\nLaboratory tests\n\nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistries (complete blood count [CBC] and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid) and pregnancy tests must be \nconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as \na guideline prior to initiation of Rebetol therapy:\n\n\uf0b7 Haemoglobin Adult: \uf0b3 12 g/dL (females); \uf0b3 13 g/dL (males)\nChildren and adolescents: \uf0b3 11 g/dL (females); \uf0b3 12 g/dL (males)\n\nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).\n\nUric acid may increase with Rebetol due to haemolysis; therefore, the potential for development of gout \nmust be carefully monitored in pre-disposed patients.\n\nInformation on excipients\n\nEach Rebetol capsule contains 40 mg of lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nResults of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated no \ncytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of Rebetol. Rebetol does not inhibit cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. There is no evidence from toxicity studies that Rebetol induces liver enzymes. Therefore, \nthere is a minimal potential for P450 enzyme-based interactions.\n\nRebetol, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere with \nazathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate \n(6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with azathioprine. The \nuse of pegylated alpha interferons and Rebetol concomitantly with azathioprine should be avoided. In \nindividual cases where the benefit of administering Rebetol concomitantly with azathioprine warrants \nthe potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done during concomitant \nazathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with these medicines \nshould be stopped (see section 4.4).\n\nNo interaction studies have been conducted with Rebetol and other medicinal products, except for \npeginterferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2b and antacids.\n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between Rebetol and peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.\n\nAntacid\nThe bioavailability of Rebetol 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid containing \nmagnesium aluminium and simethicone; AUCtf decreased 14 %. It is possible that the decreased \nbioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of Rebetol or modified pH. This interaction is not \nconsidered to be clinically relevant.\n\nNucleoside analogues\nUse of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic \nacidosis. Pharmacologically, Rebetol increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of Rebetol and didanosine is not recommended. \nReports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, \nhave been reported (see section 4.4).\nThe exacerbation of anaemia due to Rebetol has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nRebetol with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a \nknown history of zidovudine induced anaemia. \n\nAny potential for interactions may persist for up to two months (five half-lives for Rebetol) after \ncessation of Rebetol therapy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2).\n\nThere is no evidence that Rebetol interacts with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or \nprotease inhibitors.\n\nConflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and Rebetol. \nSome data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at \nrisk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/Rebetol therapy. Caution should be exercised \nwhen both medicines are co-administered.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\n\nFemale patients\nRebetol must not be used by females who are pregnant (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients (see section 5.3). Rebetol therapy must not be initiated until \na report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy. \nFemales of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for \nfour months after treatment has been concluded; routine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed \nduring this time. If pregnancy does occur during treatment or within four months from stopping \ntreatment, the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic risk of Rebetol to the foetus (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nMale patients and their female partners\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in partners of male patients taking Rebetol (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3). Rebetol accumulates intracellularly and is cleared from the body very slowly. \nIt is unknown whether the Rebetol that is contained in sperm will exert its potential teratogenic or \ngenotoxic effects on the human embryo/foetus. Although data on approximately 300 prospectively \nfollowed pregnancies with paternal exposure to Rebetol have not shown an increased risk of \nmalformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern of malformation, either \nmale patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment with Rebetol and for seven months after treatment. Routine monthly \npregnancy tests must be performed during this time. Men whose partners are pregnant must be \ninstructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of Rebetol to the partner.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of Rebetol is contraindicated during pregnancy. Rebetol has been shown in preclinical studies \nto be teratogenic and genotoxic (see section 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether Rebetol is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse \nreactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nFertility\n\nPreclinical data\n- Fertility: In animal studies, Rebetol produced reversible effects on spermatogenesis (see \n\nsection 5.3).\n- Teratogenicity: Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential have been demonstrated for \n\nRebetol in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted, occurring at doses \nas low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose (see section 5.3).\n\n- Genotoxicity: Rebetol induces genotoxicity (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nRebetol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines; however, other medicinal \nproducts used in combination may have an effect. Thus, patients who develop fatigue, somnolence, or \nconfusion during treatment must be cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe salient safety issue of Rebetol is haemolytic anaemia occurring within the first weeks of therapy. \nThe haemolytic anaemia associated with Rebetol therapy may result in deterioration of cardiac \nfunction and/or worsening of pre-existing cardiac disease. An increase in uric acid and indirect \nbilirubin values associated with haemolysis were also observed in some patients.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in this section are primarily derived from clinical trials and/or as adverse \ndrug reactions from spontaneous reports when Rebetol was used in combination with interferon \nalfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b.\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products that are used in combination with \nRebetol for additional undesirable effects reported with these products.\n\nAdults\n\nBitherapy with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b\nThe safety of Rebetol capsules is evaluated from data from four clinical trials in patients with no \nprevious exposure to interferon (interferon-na\u00efve patients): two trials studied Rebetol in combination \nwith interferon alfa-2b, two trials studied Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.\n\nPatients who are treated with interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol after previous relapse from interferon \ntherapy or who are treated for a shorter period are likely to have an improved safety profile than that \ndescribed below.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions for adults\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 5 are based on experience from clinical trials in adult na\u00efve \npatients treated for 1 year and post-marketing use. A certain number of adverse reactions, generally \nattributed to interferon therapy but that have been reported in the context of hepatitis C therapy (in \ncombination with Rebetol) are also listed for reference in Table 5. Also, refer to peginterferon alfa-2b \nand interferon alfa-2b SmPCs for adverse reactions that may be attributable to interferons \nmonotherapy. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \nfrequency using the following categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 5 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of Rebetol \nwith pegylated interferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b\n\nSystem Organ Class

There \nwere some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with Rebetol in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2b (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]); WHO \ngrade 3 leukopenia was also reported in 7 % of this treatment group.\n\nAn increase in uric acid and indirect bilirubin values associated with haemolysis was observed in \nsome patients treated with Rebetol used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b in clinical trials, but values returned to baseline levels by four weeks after the end of therapy. \nAmong those patients with elevated uric acid levels, very few patients treated with the combination \ndeveloped clinical gout, none of which required treatment modification or discontinuation from the \nclinical trials.\n\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients\nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, other \nadverse reactions (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \nstudies with a frequency > 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), CD4 \nlymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9 %), \nback pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic hepatitis \n(6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %). \n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nMitochondrial toxicity\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \nregimen and associated-Rebetol for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).\n\nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological \nabnormalities were more frequently reported in patients receiving Rebetol in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2b when compared to patients receiving Rebetol in combination with interferon \nalfa-2b. In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3\n\nwas observed in 4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in \n4 % (8/194) of patients receiving Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. Anaemia\n(haemoglobin < 9.4 g/dL) was reported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with Rebetol in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b.\n\nCD4 lymphocytes decrease\nTreatment with Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b was associated with decreases in \nabsolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The \ndecrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of \nRebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b had no observable negative impact on the control \nof HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N = 25) are available in co-infected \npatients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/\u00b5L (see section 4.4).\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with Rebetol in combination with other medicinal products.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with \ncombination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, dose modifications were required in 25 % \nof patients, most commonly for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse \nreactions profile in children and adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a \npaediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to \n48 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, growth inhibition was observed that resulted \nin reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight loss and growth inhibition were very \ncommon during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from baseline in weight and in \nheight percentiles were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth velocity was \ninhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).\n\nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles, respectively, and 20% of the children continued \nto have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety-four of 107 children enrolled in the \n5 year long-term follow-up trial. The effects on growth were less in those children treated for \n24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up among \nchildren treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 9.0 percentiles, \nrespectively. Twenty-four percent of children (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of children \n(19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment to the \nend of 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of \nchildren (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of children (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were observed \nto have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline > 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end of the 5 year \nlong-term follow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-for-age \npercentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, \nrespectively. For BMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, BMI-for-age percentiles \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\ndecreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. \nDecrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children. The decline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the \ntreatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term \nfollow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site \nerythema (29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction \n(thrombocytopenia). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in \nseverity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection \nsite pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). \nImportant treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were \nnervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and \nhypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated \nTSH. \n\nIn combination with interferon alfa-2b\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age treated with combination therapy \nof interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the \nadverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as \ndecrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean \npercentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up \npost-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44th percentile, which was below the median \nof the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) \nof 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a \n> 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term \nfollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated \nthat 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.\nDuring combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, growth inhibition \nwas observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in \nmean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs. 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., \ndepression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, \npyrexia, anorexia, vomiting and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropenia.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in paediatric population\n\nReported adverse reactions listed in Table 6 are based on experience from the two multicentre \nchildren and adolescents clinical trials using Rebetol with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nTable 6 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported during clinical \ntrials in children and adolescents with Rebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b or \npeginterferon alfa-2b\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions\nInfections and infestations\nVery common: Viral infection, pharyngitis\nCommon: Fungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, \n\nnasopharyngitis, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, \nsinusitis, tooth abscess, influenza, oral herpes, herpes \nsimplex, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, gastroenteritis\n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)\nCommon: Neoplasm unspecified\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nVery common: Anaemia, neutropenia\nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy\nEndocrine disorders\nVery common: Hypothyroidism\nCommon: Hyperthyroidism, virilism\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nVery common: Anorexia, increased appetite, decreased appetite\nCommon: Hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia\nPsychiatric disorders\nVery common: Depression, insomnia, emotional lability\nCommon: Suicidal ideation, aggression, confusion, affect liability, \n\nbehaviour disorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, \nmood altered, restlessness, nervousness, sleep disorder, \nabnormal dreaming, apathy\n\nUncommon: Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, \nfear, nightmare\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache, dizziness\nCommon: Hyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, \n\nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, \nsomnolence, disturbance in attention, poor quality of sleep\n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, psychomotor hyperactivity\nEye disorders\nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland \n\ndisorder\nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision \n\nblurred, photophobia\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nCommon: Vertigo\n\nCardiac disorders\nCommon: Tachycardia, palpitations\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Pallor, flushing\nUncommon: Hypotension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal \n\ncongestion, nasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, sneezing,\npharyngolaryngeal pain\n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nTable 6 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported during clinical \ntrials in children and adolescents with Rebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b or \npeginterferon alfa-2b\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions\nGastro-intestinal disorders\nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting , \n\ndiarrhoea, nausea\nCommon: Mouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, aphthous \n\nstomatitis, dyspepsia, cheilosis, glossitis, gastroesophoageal \nreflux, rectal disorder, gastrointestinal disorder, \nconstipation, loose stools, toothache, tooth disorder, \nstomach discomfort, oral pain\n\nUncommon: Gingivitis\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal\nUncommon: Hepatomegaly\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery common: Alopecia, rash\nCommon: Pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, \n\neczema, hyperhidrosis, acne, skin disorder, nail disorder, \nskin discolouration, dry skin, erythema, bruise\n\nUncommon: Pigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin exfoliation\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain\nCommon: Pain in extremity, back pain, muscle contracture\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence,\n\nproteinuria\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, \n\nvaginal disorder, Male: testicular pain\nUncommon: Female: dysmenorrhoea\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Fatigue, rigors, pyrexia, influenza-like illness, asthenia, \n\nmalaise, irritability\nCommon: Chest pain, oedema, pain, feeling cold\nUncommon: Chest discomfort, facial pain\nInvestigations\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for \n\nage)\nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin \n\nincreased\nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nCommon: Skin laceration\nUncommon: Contusion\n\nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the Rebetol/peginterferon alfa-2b clinical trial were mild \nor moderate.

The patient was observed for two days in the emergency room, during which time no adverse \nreaction from the overdose was noted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HCV infections, \nATC code: J05AP01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRibavirin (Rebetol) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue which has shown in vitro activity against some \nRNA and DNA viruses. The mechanism by which Rebetol in combination with other medicinal products\nexerts its effects against HCV is unknown. Oral formulations of Rebetol monotherapy have been \ninvestigated as therapy for chronic hepatitis C in several clinical trials. Results of these investigations\nshowed that Rebetol monotherapy had no effect on eliminating hepatitis virus (HCV-RNA) or improving \nhepatic histology after 6 to 12 months of therapy and 6 months of follow-up.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nRebetol in combination with Direct Antiviral Agent (DAA):\nPlease refer to the SmPC of the corresponding DAA for a full description of the clinical data with \nsuch combination.\nOnly the description of the use of Rebetol from the original development with (peg)interferon alfa-2b \nis detailed in the current SmPC:\n\nBitherapy with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b:\nThe use of Rebetol in combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b was \nevaluated in a number of clinical trials. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 30 IU/mL), a liver \nbiopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nNa\u00efve patients\nThree trials examined the use of interferon in na\u00efve patients, two with Rebetol + interferon alfa-2b \n(C95-132 and I95-143) and one with Rebetol + peginterferon alfa-2b (C/I98-580). In all cases the \ntreatment was for one year with a follow-up of six months. The sustained response at the end of \nfollow-up was significantly increased by the addition of Rebetol to interferon alfa-2b (41 % vs 16 %, \np < 0.001).\n\nIn clinical trials C95-132 and I95-143, Rebetol + interferon alfa-2b combination therapy proved to be \nsignificantly more effective than interferon alfa-2b monotherapy (a doubling in sustained response). \nCombination therapy also decreased the relapse rate. This was true for all HCV genotypes, \n\n \n\nhttps://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=J05AP&showdescription=no\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19\n\nparticularly Genotype 1, in which the relapse rate was reduced by 30 % compared with interferon \nalfa-2b monotherapy.\n\nIn clinical trial C/I98-580, 1,530 na\u00efve patients were treated for one year with one of the following \ncombination regimens:\n\uf0b7 Rebetol (800 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) (n = 511).\n\uf0b7 Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month \n\nfollowed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) (n = 514).\n\uf0b7 Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) (n = 505).\n\nIn this trial, the combination of Rebetol and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) was \nsignificantly more effective than the combination of Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b, particularly in \npatients infected with Genotype 1. Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months \nafter the cessation of treatment.\n\nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response \nrates. However, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of Rebetol \nadministered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b. In those patients that \nreceived > 10.6 mg/kg Rebetol (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral \nload, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received \uf0a3 10.6 mg/kg \nRebetol (Table 7), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg Rebetol were even \nhigher. \n\nTable 7 Sustained response rates with Rebetol + peginterferon alfa-2b \n(by Rebetol dose [mg/kg], genotype and viral load)\n\nHCV Genotype Rebetol dose\n(mg/kg)\n\nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R\n\nAll Genotypes All 54 % 47 % 47 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 50 % 41 % 27 %\n> 10.6 61 % 48 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 All 42 % 34 % 33 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 38 % 25 % 20 %\n> 10.6 48 % 34 % 34 %\n\nGenotype 1 \n\uf0a3 600,000 IU/mL\n\nAll 73 % 51 % 45 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 74 % 25 % 33 %\n> 10.6 71 % 52 % 45 %\n\nGenotype 1\n> 600,000 IU/mL\n\nAll 30 % 27 % 29 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 27 % 25 % 17 %\n> 10.6 37 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 All 82 % 80 % 79 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 79 % 73 % 50 %\n> 10.6 88 % 80 % 80 %\n\nP1.5/R Rebetol (800 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg) \nP0.5/R Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg)\nI/R Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU)\n\nIn a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received peginterferon alfa-2b, 1.5 microgram/kg \nsubcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg \u20131,400 mg p.o. for 6 months \n(based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 8). \nTwenty-four % had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nTable 8 Virologic Response at End of Treatment, Sustained Virologic Response and Relapse by \nHCV Genotype and Viral Load*\n\nRebetol 800-1,400 mg/day plus peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 \uf06dg/kg once weekly \nEnd of Treatment \n\nResponse\nSustained Virologic Response Relapse\n\nAll Subjects 94 % (211/224) 81 % (182/224) 12 % (27/224)\nHCV 2 100 % (42/42) 93 % (39/42) 7 % (3/42)\n\uf0a3 600,000 \n\nIU/mL\n100 % (20/20) 95 % (19/20) 5 % (1/20)\n\n> 600,000 \nIU/mL\n\n100 % (22/22) 91 % (20/22) 9 % (2/22)\n\nHCV 3 93 % (169/182) 79 % (143/182) 14 % (24/166)\n\uf0a3 600,000 \n\nIU/mL\n93 % (92/99) 86 % (85/99) 8 % (7/91)\n\n> 600,000 \nIU/mL\n\n93 % (77/83) 70 % (58/83) 23 % (17/75)\n\n* Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the follow-up week 12 visit and missing data at the follow-up \nweek 24 visit was considered a sustained responder. Any subject with missing data in and after the follow-up \nweek 12 window was considered to be a non-responder at week 24 of follow-up.\n\nThe 6 month treatment duration in this trial was better tolerated than one year of treatment in the \npivotal combination trial; for discontinuation 5 % vs. 14 %, for dose modification 18 % vs. 49 %.\n\nIn a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) \nreceived peginterferon alfa-2b, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with \nweight adjusted Rebetol. The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was \n50 %. Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at week 4 \nand week 24 of therapy. In this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response \nrate. The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis \n(n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).\nLimited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher \nsustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following \n24 weeks of treatment).\n\nA large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two \npeginterferon alfa-2b/Rebetol regimens [peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 \u00b5g/kg and 1 \u00b5g/kg subcutaneously \nonce weekly both in combination with Rebetol 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and \npeginterferon alfa-2a 180 \u00b5g subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily \n(in two divided doses) in 3,070 treatment-na\u00efve adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Response \nto the treatment was measured by Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) which is defined as \nundetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (see Table 9).\n\nTable 9 Virologic response at treatment week 12, end of treatment response, relapse rate* and \nSustained Virologic Response (SVR)\n\nTreatment group % (number) of patients\n\npeginterferon alfa-2b \n1.5 \u00b5g/kg \n+ Rebetol\n\npeginterferon alfa-2b \n1 \u00b5g/kg \n\n+ Rebetol\n\npeginterferon alfa-2a\n180 \u00b5g\n\n+ ribavirin\nUndetectable HCV-RNA \n\nat treatment week 12\n40 (407/1,019) 36 (366/1,016) 45 (466/1,035)\n\nEnd of treatment \nresponse*\n\n53 (542/1,019) 49 (500/1,016) 64 (667/1,035)\n\nRelapse* 24 (123/523) 20 (95/475) 32 (193/612)\n\nSVR* 40 (406/1,019) 38 (386/1,016) 41 (423/1,035)\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nTreatment group % (number) of patients\n\nSVR in patients with \nundetectable HCV-RNA \n\nat treatment week 12\n81 (328/407) 83 (303/366) 74 (344/466)\n\n*HCV-RNA PCR assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 IU/mL\nLack of early virologic response by treatment week 12 (detectable HCV-RNA with a < 2 log10 reduction from \nbaseline) was a criterion for discontinuation of treatment.\n\nIn all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. In patients of African \nAmerican origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for HCV eradication), treatment with \npeginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u00b5g/kg)/Rebetol combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic \nresponse rate compared to peginterferon alfa-2b 1 \u00b5g/kg dose. At the peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 \u00b5g/kg \nplus Rebetol dose, sustained virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients \nwith normal ALT levels, in patients with a baseline viral load > 600,000 IU/mL and in patients \n> 40 years old. Caucasian patients had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the \nAfrican Americans. Among patients with undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment, the relapse \nrate was 24 %. \n\nPredictability of sustained virological response in na\u00efve patients\nVirological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels \nof HCV-RNA. Virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or \nundetectable levels of HCV-RNA. These time points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12) have \nbeen shown to be predictive for sustained response (Table 10). \n\nTable 10 Predictive Value of In-Treatment Virologic Response while on peginterferon alfa-2b\n1.5 \u00b5g/kg/Rebetol 800-1,400 mg Combination Therapy\n\nNegative Positive\nNo \n\nresponse \nat \n\nTreatment \nWeek\n\nNo \nsustained \nResponse\n\nPredictive \nValue\n\nResponse \nat \n\nTreatment \nWeek\n\nSustained \nResponse\n\nPredictive \nValue\n\nGenotype 1*\n\nBy Week 4***\n(n= 950)\nHCV-RNA negative 834 539 65 %\n\n(539/834)\n116 107 92 %\n\n(107/116)\n\nHCV-RNA negative\nor\n\n\u2265 1 log decrease in \nviral load\n\n220 210 95 %\n(210/220)\n\n730 392 54 %\n(392/730)\n\nBy Week 12***\n(n= 915)\nHCV-RNA negative 508 433 85 %\n\n(433/508)\n407 328 81 %\n\n(328/407)\nHCV-RNA negative\n\nor\n\u2265 2 log decrease in \n\nviral load\n\n206 205 N/A\u2020 709 402 57 %\n(402/709)\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nGenotype 2, 3**\n\nBy Week 12\n(n=215)\nHCV-RNA negative \n\nor \n\u2265 2 log decrease in \n\nviral load \n\n2 1 50 %\n(1/2)\n\n213 177 83 %\n(177/213)\n\n*Genotype 1 receive 48 weeks treatment\n**Genotype 2, 3 receive 24 weeks treatment\n***The presented results are from a single point of time.

The response to treatment \nin both of these trials is presented in Table 11. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, \nmulticentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who \nwere co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either Rebetol (800 mg/day) plus \npeginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) or Rebetol (800 mg/day) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) \nfor 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre \nstudy that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were \nco-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either Rebetol (800-1,200 mg/day based \non weight) plus peginterferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 \u00b5g/week based on weight) or Rebetol \n(800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW). The duration of therapy \nwas 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 \nand viral load < 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6 month follow-up \nperiod.\n\nTable 11 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Rebetol in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2b in HCV/HIV co-infected patients\n\nStudy 11 Study 22\n\nRebetol \n(800 mg/day) \n\n+\npeginterferon \n\nalfa-2b \n(1.5 \u00b5g/kg/\n\nweek)\n\nRebetol \n(800 mg/day) +\n\ninterferon \nalfa-2b (3 MIU \n\nTIW)\np \n\nvaluea\n\nRebetol (800-\n1,200 mg/day)d\n\n+\npeginterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 or \n150c \u00b5g/week)\n\nRebetol (800-\n1,200 mg/day)d\n\n+\ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b \n(3 MIU TIW)\n\np \nvalueb\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017\nGenotype 1, 4 17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007\nGenotype 2, 3 44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730\n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.\na: p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.\nb: p value based on chi-square test.\nc: subjects < 75 kg received 100 \u00b5g/week peginterferon alfa-2b and subjects \u2265 75 kg received 150 \u00b5g/week peginterferon \n\nalfa-2b .\nd: Rebetol dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.\n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement \nand none showed worsening. There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study. \nSteatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3. \n\nPreviously treated patients\n- Retreatment of prior treatment failures (relapse and non-responder patients) with peginterferon \nalfa-2b in combination with Rebetol:\nIn a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous \ntreatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with peginterferon alfa-2b, \n1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted Rebetol. Failure \nto prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum \nof 12 weeks of treatment).\n\nPatients who were HCV-RNA negative at Treatment week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and \nwere followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Response week 12 was defined as undetectable \nHCV-RNA after 12 weeks of treatment. Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as \nundetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 12).\n\nTable 12 Rates of Response to retreatment in prior treatment failures \nPatients with undetectable HCV\u2013RNA \n\nat treatment week 12 and SVR upon retreatement\n\ninterferon alpha/ribavirin peginterferon alpha/ribavirin\nOverall \n\nPopulation*\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99 % CI\n\nOverall 38.6 \n(549/1,423)\n\n59.4\n(326/549)\n54.0,64.8\n\n31.5 \n(272/863)\n\n50.4 \n(137/272)\n42.6, 58.2\n\n21.7 \n(497/2,293)\n19.5, 23.9\n\nPrior Response\n  Relapse 67.7 (203/300) 59.6 \n\n(121/203)\n50.7, 68.5\n\n58.1 \n(200/344)\n\n52.5 \n(105/200)\n43.4, 61.6\n\n37.7 (243/645)\n32.8, 42.6\n\n     Genotype 1/4 59.7 (129/216) 51.2 (66/129)\n39.8, 62.5\n\n48.6 \n(122/251)\n\n44.3 (54/122)\n32.7, 55.8\n\n28.6 (134/468)\n23.3, 34.0\n\n     Genotype 2/3 88.9 (72/81) 73.6 (53/72)\n(60.2, 87.0)\n\n83.7 (77/92) 64.9 (50/77)\n50.9, 78.9\n\n61.3 (106/173)\n51.7, 70.8\n\n  NR 28.6 (258/903) 57.0 \n(147/258)\n49.0, 64.9\n\n12.4 (59/476) 44.1 (26/59)\n27.4, 60.7\n\n13.6 \n(188/1,385)\n11.2, 15.9\n\n     Genotype 1/4 23.0 (182/790) 51.6 (94/182)\n42.1, 61.2\n\n9.9 (44/446) 38.6 (17/44)\n19.7, 57.5\n\n9.9 (123/1,242)\n7.7, 12.1\n\n     Genotype 2/3 67.9 (74/109) 70.3 (52/74)\n56.6, 84.0\n\n53.6 (15/28) 60.0 (9/15)\n27.4, 92.6\n\n46.0 (63/137)\n35.0, 57.0\n\nGenotype\n    1 30.2 \n\n(343/1,135)\n51.3 \n(176/343)\n44.4, 58.3\n\n23.0 \n(162/704)\n\n42.6 (69/162)\n32.6, 52.6\n\n14.6 \n(270/1,846)\n12.5, 16.7\n\n    2/3 77.1 (185/240) 73.0 \n(135/185)\n64.6, 81.4\n\n75.6 (96/127) 63.5 (61/96)\n50.9, 76.2\n\n55.3 (203/367)\n48.6, 62.0\n\n     4 42.5 (17/40) 70.6 (12/17)\n42.1, 99.1\n\n44.4 (12/27) 50.0 (6/12)\n12.8, 87.2\n\n28.4 (19/67)\n14.2, 42.5\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nTable 12 Rates of Response to retreatment in prior treatment failures \nPatients with undetectable HCV\u2013RNA \n\nat treatment week 12 and SVR upon retreatement\n\ninterferon alpha/ribavirin peginterferon alpha/ribavirin\nOverall \n\nPopulation*\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99 % CI\n\nMETAVIR \nFibrosis score\n    F2 46.0 (193/420) 66.8 \n\n(129/193)\n58.1, 75.6\n\n33.6 (78/232) 57.7 (45/78)\n43.3, 72.1\n\n29.2 (191/653)\n24.7, 33.8\n\n    F3 38.0 (163/429) 62.6 \n(102/163)\n52.8, 72.3\n\n32.4 (78/241) 51.3 (40/78)\n36.7, 65.9\n\n21.9 (147/672)\n17.8, 26.0\n\n    F4 33.6 (192/572) 49.5 (95/192)\n40.2, 58.8\n\n29.7 \n(116/390)\n\n44.8 (52/116)\n32.9, 56.7\n\n16.5 (159/966)\n13.4, 19.5\n\nBaseline Viral \nLoad\nHVL (>600,000 \nIU/mL)\n\n32.4 (280/864) 56.1 \n(157/280)\n48.4, 63.7\n\n26.5 \n(152/573)\n\n41.4 (63/152)\n31.2, 51.7\n\n16.6 \n(239/1,441)\n14.1, 19.1\n\nLVL (\u2264600,000 \nIU/mL)\n\n48.3 (269/557) 62.8 \n(169/269)\n55.2, 70.4\n\n41.0 \n(118/288)\n\n61.0 (72/118)\n49.5, 72.6\n\n30.2 (256/848)\n26.1, 34.2\n\nNR: Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.\nPlasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central \nlaboratory\n\n*Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.\n\nOverall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at \nweek 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/mL). In this \nsubgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. For patients with prior \nfailure on therapy with non-pegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the \nsustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively. Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral \nreduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. In those patients \nthe SVR was 12 %.\n\nNon-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a \nweek 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to non-pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin \n(12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). However, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR \nregardless of prior treatment or prior response.\n\n- Retreatment of relapse patients with Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment\nTwo trials examined the use of Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment in relapse \npatients (C95-144 and I95-145); 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had relapsed after previous \ninterferon treatment were treated for six months with a six month follow-up. Combination therapy \nwith Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b resulted in a sustained virological response that was ten-fold \nhigher than that with interferon alfa-2b alone (49 % vs 5 %, p < 0.0001). This benefit was maintained \nirrespective of standard predictors of response to interferon alfa-2b such as virus level, HCV genotype \nand histological staging.\n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nLong-term efficacy data \u2013 Adults\n\nTwo large long-term follow-up studies enrolled 1,071 patients and 567 patients after treatment in \nprior studies with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without Rebetol) and pegylated interferon \nalfa-2b (with or without Rebetol), respectively. The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the \ndurability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity \non clinical outcomes. At least 5 years of long-term follow-up was completed after treatment in \n462 patients and 327 patients, respectively. Twelve out of 492 sustained responders and only 3 out of \n366 sustained responders relapsed, respectively, in the studies.\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 97 % (95 % CI: 95-99 %) \nfor patients receiving non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without Rebetol), and is 99 % (95 % \nCI: 98-100 %) for patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without Rebetol).\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and non-pegylated, with or \nwithout Rebetol) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic \ninfection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of \nhepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nRebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with Rebetol 15 mg/kg per day plus \npegylated interferon alfa-2b 60 \u00b5g/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and \nbaseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of \n107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV \nGenotype 1 and 63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with \nmild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the \ndisease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of Rebetol and \npegylated interferon alfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 \nand 4.8). The study results are summarized in Table 13.\n\nTable 13 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects\n\nn = 107\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\n\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \ndetection = 125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \n\ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\nRebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received Rebetol 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2\n\n3 times a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after treatment. A total of 118 patients were \nenrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1, 64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population \nenrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials, \nsustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to \n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nthe lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of Rebetol and interferon \nalfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).The study \nresults are summarized in Table 14.\n\nTable 14 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents\nRebetol 15 mg/kg/day \n\n+\ninterferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\nOverall Responsea (n = 118) 54 (46 %)*\nGenotype 1 (n = 92) 33 (36 %)*\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n = 26) 21 (81 %)*\n* Number (%) of patients\na.

The \npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) \nand assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were \nsustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and \nribavirin treatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of \nsustained responders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR relapsed during the \n5 years of follow-up.\n\nRebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b\nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in two previously mentioned multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\n\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with Rebetol results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIn a single dose, crossover study of ribavirin in healthy adult subjects, the capsule and oral solution \nformulations were found to be bioequivalent.\n\nAbsorption\n\nRibavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose (mean Tmax= 1.5 hours), \nfollowed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases (single dose half-lives of absorption, \ndistribution and elimination are 0.05, 3.73 and 79 hours, respectively). Absorption is extensive with \n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\napproximately 10 % of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces. However, absolute bioavailability is \napproximately 45 %-65 %, which appears to be due to first pass metabolism. There is a linear \nrelationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200-1,200 mg ribavirin. Volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,000 l. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins.\n\nDistribution\n\nRibavirin transport in non-plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells, and has \nbeen identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of transporter\nis present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of ribavirin. The \nratio of whole blood:plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1; the excess of ribavirin in \nwhole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nRibavirin has two pathways of metabolism: 1) a reversible phosphorylation pathway; 2) a degradative \npathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxyacid metabolite. Both \nribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are also excreted renally.\n\nRibavirin has been shown to produce high inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability following \nsingle oral doses (intrasubject variability of approximately 30 % for both AUC and Cmax), which may be \ndue to extensive first pass metabolism and transfer within and beyond the blood compartment.\n\nElimination\n\nUpon multiple dosing, ribavirin accumulates extensively in plasma with a six-fold ratio of multiple-dose \nto single-dose AUC12hr. Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID, steady-state was reached by \napproximately four weeks, with mean steady state plasma concentrations approximately 2,200 ng/mL. \nUpon discontinuation of dosing the half-life was approximately 298 hours, which probably reflects slow \nelimination from non-plasma compartments.\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\nFood effect\nThe bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by co-administration of a high fat \nmeal (AUCtf and Cmax both increased by 70 %). It is possible that the increased bioavailability in this \nstudy was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. The clinical relevance of results from this \nsingle dose study is unknown. In the pivotal clinical efficacy trial, patients were instructed to take \nribavirin with food to achieve the maximal plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\nRenal function\nBased on published data, single-dose ribavirin pharmacokinetics was altered (increased AUCtf and Cmax) \nin patients with renal dysfunction compared with control subjects (creatinine clearance > 90 mL/minute). \nThe mean AUCtf was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance between 10 and \n30 mL/min compared with control subjects. In subjects with creatinine clearance between 30 and \n50 mL/min, AUCtf was twofold greater compared with control subjects. This appears to be due to \nreduction of apparent clearance in these patients. Ribavirin concentrations are essentially unchanged by \nhaemodialysis. \n\nHepatic function\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction \n(Child-Pugh Classification A, B or C) is similar to those of normal controls. \n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nElderly patients (\uf0b3 65 years of age)\nSpecific pharmacokinetic evaluations for elderly subjects have not been performed. However, in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic study, age was not a key factor in the kinetics of ribavirin; renal function is \nthe determining factor.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using sparsely sampled serum concentration values \nfrom four controlled clinical trials. The clearance model developed showed that body weight, gender, \nage, and serum creatinine were the main covariates. For males, clearance was approximately 20 % higher \nthan for females. Clearance increased as a function of body weight and was reduced at ages greater than \n40 years. Effects of these covariates on ribavirin clearance appear to be of limited clinical significance \ndue to the substantial residual variability not accounted for by the model.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nRebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Rebetol and peginterferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C have been evaluated during a clinical study. In children \nand adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of peginterferon alfa-2b at \n60 \u00b5g/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted \nto be 58 % (90 % CI: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week. The \npharmacokinetics of Rebetol (dose-normalized) in this trial was similar to those reported in a prior \nstudy of Rebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescent patients and in \nadult patients.\n\nRebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Rebetol capsules and interferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 15. The \npharmacokinetics of Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) is similar in adults and children \nor adolescents.\n\nTable 15 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for interferon alfa-2b and \nRebetol capsules when administered to paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C\nParameter Rebetol\n\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n(n = 17)\n\nInterferon alfa-2b\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for Rebetol; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for interferon alfa-2b\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRibavirin\nRibavirin is embryotoxic or teratogenic, or both, at doses well below the recommended human dose in \nall animal species in which studies have been conducted. Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, \nlimbs, skeleton and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects \nincreased with escalation of the dose. Survival of foetuses and offspring was reduced.\n\nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups dosed from postnatal day 7 to 63 with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of \nribavirin demonstrated a dose-related decrease in overall growth, which was subsequently manifested \nas slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length and bone length. At the end of the recovery \nperiod, tibial and femoral changes were minimal although generally statistically significant compared \nto controls in males at all dose levels and in females dosed with the two highest doses compared to \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\ncontrols. No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed \nregarding neurobehavioural or reproductive development. Plasma concentrations achieved in rat pups \nwere below human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose.\n\nErythrocytes are a primary target of toxicity for ribavirin in animal studies. Anaemia occurs shortly after \ninitiation of dosing, but is rapidly reversible upon cessation of treatment.\n\nIn 3- and 6-month studies in mice to investigate ribavirin-induced testicular and sperm effects, \nabnormalities in sperm, occurred at doses of 15 mg/kg and above. These doses in animals produce \nsystemic exposures well below those achieved in humans at therapeutic doses. Upon cessation of \ntreatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity occurred within one or two \nspermatogenic cycles (see section 4.6).\n\nGenotoxicity studies have demonstrated that ribavirin does exert some genotoxic activity. Ribavirin was \nactive in the Balb/3T3 in vitro transformation assay. Genotoxic activity was observed in the mouse \nlymphoma assay, and at doses of 20-200 mg/kg in a mouse micronucleus assay. A dominant lethal assay \nin rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted through male \ngametes.\n\nConventional carcinogenicity rodent studies with low exposures compared to human exposure under\ntherapeutic conditions (factor 0.1 in rats and 1 in mice) did not reveal tumorigenicity of ribavirin. In \naddition, in a 26 week carcinogenicity study using the heterozygous p53(+/-) mouse model, ribavirin \ndid not produce tumours at the maximally tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg (plasma exposure factor \napproximately 2.5 compared to human exposure). These studies suggest that a carcinogenic potential \nof ribavirin in humans is unlikely.\n\nRibavirin plus interferon\nWhen used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, ribavirin did not cause any \neffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. The major treatment-related change \nwas a reversible mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by \neither active substance alone.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRebetol is indicated in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) for paediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents) not \npreviously treated and without liver decompensation (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated, and monitored, by a physician experienced in the management of \nchronic hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\n\nRebetol must be used in combination therapy as described in section 4.1.\nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of medicinal products\nused in combination with Rebetol for additional prescribing information particular to that product and \nfor further dosage recommendations on co-administration with Rebetol.\n\nRebetol oral solution is supplied in a concentration of 40 mg/mL.\nRebetol oral solution is administered orally in two divided doses (morning and evening) with food.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo data are available in children below 3 years of age.\n\nDosing of Rebetol for children and adolescent patients is determined by the patient body weight. For \nexample, the body weight dosing used in conjunction with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b \nis shown in Table 1. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in \ncombination with Rebetol as some combination regimens do not adhere to the Rebetol dosing \nguidance provided in Table 1.\n\nIn clinical studies performed in this population, Rebetol was used in doses of 15 mg/kg/day (Table 1).\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nTable 1 Rebetol oral solution - Children and adolescents dosage to be administered with interferon \nalfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b\n\nBody Weight (kg) Measured Dose\n(Morning / Evening)\n\n10-12 2 mL / 2 mL\n13-14 3 mL / 2 mL\n15-17 3 mL / 3 mL\n18-20 4 mL / 3 mL\n21-22 4 mL / 4 mL\n23-25 5 mL / 4 mL\n26-28 5 mL / 5 mL\n29-31 6 mL / 5 mL\n32-33 6 mL / 6 mL\n34-36 7 mL / 6 mL\n37-39 7 mL / 7 mL\n40-41 8 mL / 7 mL\n42-44 8 mL / 8 mL\n45-47 9 mL / 8 mL\n\nPatients who weigh > 47 kg and are able to swallow capsules may take the equivalent dose of \nribavirin 200 mg capsules in two divided doses (Please see SmPC for Rebetol capsules).\n\nDose modification for adverse reactions\nDose reduction of Rebetol depends on the initial Rebetol posology which depends on the medicinal \nproduct that is used in combination with Rebetol.\n\nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to Rebetol, the Rebetol dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. \n\nTable 2 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s \nhaemoglobin concentration and indirect bilirubin concentration.\n\nThere are no data for paediatric patients with cardiac disease (see section 4.4).\n\nTable 2 Management of Adverse Reactions\nLaboratory values Reduce Rebetol dose*\n\nif:\nDiscontinue\nRebetol if:\n\nHaemoglobin in patients with \nNo Cardiac Disease\n\n< 10 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL\n\nBilirubin - Indirect - > 5 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks)\n(children and adolescents \n\ntreated with interferon \nalfa-2b),\n\nor \n> 4 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n(children and adolescents \ntreated with peginterferon \n\nalfa-2b)\n* In children and adolescent patients treated with Rebetol plus peginterferon alfa-2b, 1st dose \nreduction of Rebetol is to 12 mg/kg/day, 2nd dose reduction of Rebetol is to 8 mg/kg/day.\nIn children and adolescent patients treated with Rebetol plus interferon alfa-2b, reduce Rebetol dose \nto 7.5 mg/kg/day.\n\nIn case of serious adverse reaction potentially related to medicinal products used in combination with \nRebetol, please refer to the corresponding SmPC of these medicinal products as some combination \n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nregimens do not adhere to the Rebetol dose modification and/or discontinuation guidelines as \ndescribed in Table 2.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents)\nRebetol may be used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b (see section 4.4). \nThe selection of Rebetol formulation is based on individual characteristics of the patient. \nThe safety and efficacy of ribavirin used together with direct-acting-anti-virals in these patients has \nnot been established. No data are available.\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with Rebetol for \nfurther dosage recommendations on co-administration.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rebetol is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent creatinine clearance in these patients (see section 5.2). Therefore, it is recommended that \nrenal function be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of Rebetol. Adult patients with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 30- 50 mL/minute) should be administered alternating daily \ndoses of 200 mg and 400 mg. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 30 mL/minute) and patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or on haemodialysis should be \nadministered Rebetol 200 mg/day. Table 3 provides guidelines for dose modification for patients with \nrenal dysfunction. Patients with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with \nrespect to the development of anaemia. No data are available regarding dose modification for \npaediatric patients with renal impairment.\n\nTable 3 Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment in Adult Patients\nCreatinine Clearance Rebetol Dose (daily)\n30 to 50 mL/min Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day\nLess than 30 mL/min 200 mg daily\nHaemodialysis (ESRD) 200 mg daily\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction appears between Rebetol and hepatic function (see section 5.2). For \nuse in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, see the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used \nin combination with Rebetol.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nRebetol should be administered orally with food. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Pregnancy (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3). In females of childbearing potential, Rebetol must not \n\nbe initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to \ninitiation of therapy.\n\n- Breast-feeding.\n- History of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease, \n\nin the previous six months (see section 4.4).\n- Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia).\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with Rebetol for \ncontraindications specific to these products.\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRebetol must be used in combination with other medicinal products (see section 5.1).\n\nPlease refer to the SmPC of (peg)interferon alfa for details on the recommendations of monitoring and \nmanagement regarding the adverse reactions listed below before initiating therapy and other \nprecautions associated with (peg)interferon alfa.\n\nThere are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of Rebetol with \n(peg)interferon alfa. These include:\n- Severe psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal ideation, \n\nattempted suicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.)\n- Growth inhibition in children and adolescents that may be irreversible in some patients\n- Increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in children and adolscents\n- Severe ocular disorders\n- Dental and periodontal disorders.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nWhen deciding not to defer combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \nuntil adulthood, it is important to consider that this combination therapy induced a growth inhibition \nthat may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case.\n\nHaemolysis\n\nA decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/dL was observed in up to 14 % of adult patients and in 7 % \nof children and adolescents treated with Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b in clinical trials. Although Rebetol has no direct cardiovascular effects, anaemia associated with \nRebetol may result in deterioration of cardiac function, or exacerbation of the symptoms of coronary \ndisease or both. Thus, Rebetol must be administered with caution to patients with pre-existing cardiac \ndisease (see section 4.3). Cardiac status must be assessed before start of therapy and monitored clinically \nduring therapy; if any deterioration occurs, therapy must be stopped (see section 4.2).\n\nCardiovascular\n\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have \npre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of \ntreatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but \nmay require discontinuation of therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of \ncardiac disease.\n\nTeratogenic risk\n\nPrior to initiation of treatment with Rebetol the physician must comprehensively inform both male \nand female patients of the teratogenic risk of Rebetol, the necessity of effective and continuous \ncontraception, the possibility that contraceptive methods may fail and the possible consequences of \npregnancy should it occur during or following treatment with Rebetol (see section 4.6). For laboratory \nmonitoring of pregnancy, please refer to Laboratory tests.\n\nAcute hypersensitivity\n\nIf an acute hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) \ndevelops, Rebetol must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy instituted. \nTransient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nLiver function\n\nAny patient developing significant liver function abnormalities during treatment must be monitored \nclosely. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with \nRebetol for discontinuation or dose modification recommendations. \n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rebetol is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent clearance in these patients. Therefore, it is recommended that renal function be evaluated in \nall patients prior to initiation of Rebetol. Due to substantial increases in ribavirin plasma \nconcentrations in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, Rebetol dose adjustments are \nrecommended in adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute. No data are available \nregarding dose modification for paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\nHaemoglobin concentrations should be monitored closely during treatment and corrective action taken \nas necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nPotential to exacerbate immunosuppression\n\nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to \n7 weeks after the administration of a peginterferon and Rebetol concomitantly with azathioprine. This \nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infection\n\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:\nCaution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon \nalfa/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should \ncarefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when Rebetol is administered. \nFor additional details see section 4.5.\n\nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) may \nbe at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Other baseline factors in co-infected \npatients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with \ndidanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentrations.\nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC \nof medicinal products used in combination with Rebetol for discontinuation or dose modification \nrecommendations. Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis \ntreatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.\n\nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and cART may be \nat increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be \nmanaged by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in \nthis population of patients (see section 4.2 and below \u201cLaboratory tests\u201d and section 4.8).\nPatients treated with Rebetol and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, the \nconcomitant use of Rebetol with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n36\n\nPatients with low CD4 counts\nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/\u00b5L. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \npatients with low CD4 counts.\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with Rebetol.\n\nLaboratory tests\n\nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistries (complete blood count [CBC] and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid) and pregnancy tests must be \nconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered \nas a guideline prior to initiation of Rebetol therapy in children and adolescents:\n\n\uf0b7 Haemoglobin \uf0b3 11 g/dL (females); \uf0b3 12 g/dL (males)\n\nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).\n\nUric acid may increase with Rebetol due to haemolysis; therefore, the potential for development of gout \nmust be carefully monitored in pre-disposed patients.\n\nInformation on excipients\n\nThis product contains sucrose and sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not \ntake this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nResults of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated no \ncytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of Rebetol. Rebetol does not inhibit cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. There is no evidence from toxicity studies that Rebetol induces liver enzymes. Therefore, \nthere is a minimal potential for P450 enzyme-based interactions.\n\nRebetol, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere with \nazathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate \n(6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with azathioprine. The \nuse of pegylated alpha interferons and Rebetol concomitantly with azathioprine should be avoided. In \nindividual cases where the benefit of administering Rebetol concomitantly with azathioprine warrants \nthe potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done during concomitant \nazathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with these medicines \nshould be stopped (see section 4.4).\n\nNo interaction studies have been conducted with Rebetol and other medicinal products, except for \ninterferon alfa-2b and antacids.\n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b in a \nmultiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.\n\n \n\n\n\n37\n\nAntacid\nThe bioavailability of Rebetol 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid containing \nmagnesium, aluminium and simethicone; AUCtf decreased 14 %. It is possible that the decreased \nbioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of Rebetol or modified pH. This interaction is not \nconsidered to be clinically relevant.\n\nNucleoside analogues\nUse of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic \nacidosis. Pharmacologically, Rebetol increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of Rebetol and didanosine is not recommended. \nReports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, \nhave been reported (see section 4.4).\nThe exacerbation of anaemia due to Rebetol has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nRebetol with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) \nregimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known \nhistory of zidovudine induced anaemia.\n\nAny potential for interactions may persist for up to two months (five half-lives for Rebetol) after \ncessation of Rebetol therapy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2).\n\nThere is no evidence that Rebetol interacts with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or \nprotease inhibitors.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\n\nFemale patients\nRebetol must not be used by females who are pregnant (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). Extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients (see section 5.3). Rebetol therapy must not be initiated until \na report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy. \nFemales of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for \nfour months after treatment has been concluded; routine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed \nduring this time. If pregnancy does occur during treatment or within four months from stopping \ntreatment, the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic risk of Rebetol to the foetus (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nMale patients and their female partners\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in partners of male patients taking Rebetol (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3). Rebetol accumulates intracellularly and is cleared from the body very slowly. \nIt is unknown whether the Rebetol that is contained in sperm will exert its potential teratogenic or \ngenotoxic effects on the human embryo/foetus. Although data on approximately 300 prospectively \nfollowed pregnancies with paternal exposure to Rebetol have not shown an increased risk of \nmalformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern of malformation, either \nmale patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment with Rebetol and for seven months after treatment. Routine monthly \npregnancy tests must be performed during this time. Men whose partners are pregnant must be \ninstructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of Rebetol to the partner.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of Rebetol is contraindicated during pregnancy. Rebetol has been shown in preclinical studies \nto be teratogenic and genotoxic (see section 4.4 and 5.3).\n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether Rebetol is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse \nreactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nFertility\n\nPreclinical data\n- Fertility: In animal studies, Rebetol produced reversible effects on spermatogenesis (see \n\nsection 5.3).\n- Teratogenicity: Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential have been demonstrated for \n\nRebetol in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted, occurring at doses \nas low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose (see section 5.3).\n\n- Genotoxicity: Rebetol induces genotoxicity (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nRebetol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines; however, other medicinal \nproducts used in combination may have an effect. Thus, patients who develop fatigue, somnolence, or \nconfusion during treatment must be cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of safety profile\n\nThe salient safety issue of Rebetol is haemolytic anaemia occurring within the first weeks of therapy. \nThe haemolytic anaemia associated with Rebetol therapy may result in deterioration of cardiac \nfunction and/or worsening of pre-existing cardiac disease. An increase in uric acid and indirect \nbilirubin values associated with haemolysis were also observed in some patients.\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in this section are primarily derived from clinical trials and/or as adverse \ndrug reactions from spontaneous reports when Rebetol was used in combination with interferon \nalfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b.\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products that are used in combination with \nRebetol for additional undesirable effects reported with these products.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with \ncombination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, dose modifications were required in 25 % \nof patients, most commonly for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse \nreactions profile in children and adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a \npaediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to \n48 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, growth inhibition was observed that resulted \nin reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight loss and growth inhibition were very \ncommon during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from baseline in weight and in \nheight percentiles were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth velocity was \ninhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).\n\nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles, respectively, and 20% of the children continued \nto have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety-four of 107 children enrolled in the \n5 year long-term follow-up trial. The effects on growth were less in those children treated for \n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\n24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up among \nchildren treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 9.0 percentiles, \nrespectively. Twenty-four percent of children (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of children \n(19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment to the \nend of 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of \nchildren (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of children (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were observed \nto have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline > 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end of the 5 year \nlong-term follow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-for-age \npercentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, \nrespectively. For BMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, BMI-for-age percentiles \ndecreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. \nDecrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children. The decline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the \ntreatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term \nfollow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection site \nerythema (29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction \n(thrombocytopenia). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in \nseverity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection \nsite pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). \nImportant treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were \nnervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and \nhypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated \nTSH.\n\nIn combination with interferon alfa-2b\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age treated with combination therapy \nof interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the \nadverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as \ndecrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean \npercentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up \npost-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44th percentile, which was below the median \nof the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) \nof 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a \n> 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term \nfollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated \nthat 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.\nDuring combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with interferon alfa-2b and Rebetol, growth inhibition \nwas observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in \nmean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children (see section 4.4).\n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs. 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., \ndepression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, \npyrexia, anorexia, vomiting and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropenia.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in paediatric population\n\nReported adverse reactions listed in Table 4 are based on experience from the two multicentre \nchildren and adolescents clinical trials using Rebetol with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100).

The \npatient was observed for two days in the emergency room, during which time no adverse reaction from \nthe overdose was noted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HCV infections, \nATC code: J05AP01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRibavirin (Rebetol) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue which has shown in vitro activity against some \nRNA and DNA viruses. The mechanism by which Rebetol in combination with other medicinal products \nexerts its effects against HCV is unknown. Oral formulations of Rebetol monotherapy have been \ninvestigated as therapy for chronic hepatitis C in several clinical trials. Results of these investigations \nshowed that Rebetol monotherapy had no effect on eliminating hepatitis virus (HCV-RNA) or improving \nhepatic histology after 6 to 12 months of therapy and 6 months of follow-up.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=J05AP&showdescription=no\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nOnly the description of the use of Rebetol from the original development with (peg)interferon alfa-2b \nis detailed in the current SmPC.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nRebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with Rebetol 15 mg/kg per day plus \npegylated interferon alfa-2b 60 \u00b5g/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and \nbaseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of \n107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV \nGenotype 1 and 63 % < 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with \nmild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the \ndisease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of Rebetol and \npegylated interferon alfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 \nand 4.8).The study results are summarized in Table 6\n\nTable 6 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013All subjects\n\nn = 107\n24 weeks 48 weeks\n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\n\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \ndetection = 125 IU/mL.\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \n\ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\nRebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received Rebetol 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 three \ntimes a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were \nenrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1, 64 % \uf0a3 12 years of age. The population \nenrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. The population enrolled \nmainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials, sustained \nvirological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults (see Table 7). \nDue to the lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the \ndisease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of Rebetol and \ninterferon alfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \nThe study results are summarized in Table 7.\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nTable 7 Sustained virological response: previously untreated children and adolescents\nRebetol 15 mg/kg/day \n\n+\ninterferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\nOverall Responsea (n = 118) 54 (46 %)*\nGenotype 1 (n = 92) 33 (36 %)*\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n = 26) 21 (81 %)*\n*Number (%) of patients\na. Defined as HCV RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period\n\nLong-term efficacy data\n\nRebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in a multicentre trial. Of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. The \npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) \nand assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were \nsustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and \nribavirin treatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of \nsustained responders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR relapsed during the \n5 years of follow-up.\n\nRebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b\nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in two previously mentioned multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit.\n\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with Rebetol results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIn a single dose, crossover study of ribavirin in healthy adult subjects, the capsule and oral solution \nformulations were found to be bioequivalent.\n\nAbsorption\n\nRibavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose (mean Tmax= 1.5 hours), \nfollowed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases (single dose half-lives of absorption, \ndistribution and elimination are 0.05, 3.73 and 79 hours, respectively). Absorption is extensive with \napproximately 10 % of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces. However, absolute bioavailability is \napproximately 45 %-65 %, which appears to be due to first pass metabolism. There is a linear \nrelationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200-1,200 mg ribavirin. Volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,000 l. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins.\n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\nDistribution\n\nRibavirin transport in non-plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells, and has \nbeen identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of transporter\nis present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of ribavirin. The \nratio of whole blood:plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1; the excess of ribavirin in \nwhole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nRibavirin has two pathways of metabolism: 1) a reversible phosphorylation pathway; 2) a degradative \npathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxyacid metabolite. Both \nribavirin and its triazole, carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are also excreted renally.\n\nRibavirin has been shown to produce high inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability following \nsingle oral doses (intrasubject variability of approximately 30 % for both AUC and Cmax), which may be \ndue to extensive first pass metabolism and transfer within and beyond the blood compartment.\n\nElimination\n\nUpon multiple dosing, ribavirin accumulates extensively in plasma with a six-fold ratio of multiple-dose \nto single-dose AUC12hr. Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID, steady-state was reached by \napproximately four weeks, with mean steady state plasma concentrations approximately 2,200 ng/mL. \nUpon discontinuation of dosing the half-life was approximately 298 hours, which probably reflects slow \nelimination from non-plasma compartments.\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\nFood effect\nThe bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by co-administration of a high fat \nmeal (AUCtf and Cmax both increased by 70 %). It is possible that the increased bioavailability in this \nstudy was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. The clinical relevance of results from this \nsingle dose study is unknown. In the pivotal clinical efficacy trial, patients were instructed to take \nribavirin with food to achieve the maximal plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\nRenal function\nBased on published data, single-dose ribavirin pharmacokinetics was altered (increased AUCtf and Cmax) \nin patients with renal dysfunction compared with control subjects (creatinine clearance > 90 mL/minute). \nThe mean AUCtf was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance between 10 and \n30 mL/min compared with control subjects. In subjects with creatinine clearance between 30 and \n50 mL/min, AUCtf was twofold greater compared with control subjects. This appears to be due to \nreduction of apparent clearance in these patients. Ribavirin concentrations are essentially unchanged by \nhaemodialysis. \n\nHepatic function\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction \n(Child-Pugh Classification A, B or C) is similar to those of normal controls.\n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\nPaediatric population\n\nRebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Rebetol and peginterferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C have been evaluated during a clinical study. In children \nand adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of peginterferon alfa-2b at \n60 \u00b5g/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted \nto be 58 % (90 % CI: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week. The \npharmacokinetics of Rebetol (dose-normalized) in this trial was similar to those reported in a prior \nstudy of Rebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescent patients and in \nadult patients.\n\nRebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Rebetol capsules and interferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 8. The \npharmacokinetics of Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) is similar in adults and children \nor adolescents.\n\nTable 8 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for interferon alfa-2b and \nRebetol capsules when administered to paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C\n\nPARAMETER Rebetol\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses\n\n(n = 17)\n\nInterferon alfa-2b\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week\n\n(n = 54)\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36)\n\nCmax (ng/mL) 3,275 (25) 51 (48)\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48)\n\nApparent clearance L/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for Rebetol; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) for interferon alfa-2b\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRibavirin\nRibavirin is embryotoxic or teratogenic, or both, at doses well below the recommended human dose in \nall animal species in which studies have been conducted. Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, \nlimbs, skeleton and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects \nincreased with escalation of the dose. Survival of foetuses and offspring was reduced.\n\nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups dosed from postnatal day 7 to 63 with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of \nribavirin demonstrated a dose-related decrease in overall growth, which was subsequently manifested \nas slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length and bone length. At the end of the recovery \nperiod, tibial and femoral changes were minimal although generally statistically significant compared \nto controls in males at all dose levels and in females dosed with the two highest doses compared to \ncontrols. No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed \nregarding neurobehavioural or reproductive development. Plasma concentrations achieved in rat pups \nwere below human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose.\n\nErythrocytes are a primary target of toxicity for ribavirin in animal studies. Anaemia occurs shortly after \ninitiation of dosing, but is rapidly reversible upon cessation of treatment.\n\nIn 3-and 6-month studies in mice to investigate ribavirin-induced testicular and sperm effects, \nabnormalities in sperm occurred at doses of 15 mg/kg and above. These doses in animals produce \nsystemic exposures well below those achieved in humans at therapeutic doses. Upon cessation of \ntreatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity occurred within one or \ntwo spermatogenic cycles (see section 4.6).\n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\nGenotoxicity studies have demonstrated that ribavirin does exert some genotoxic activity. Ribavirin was \nactive in the Balb/3T3 in vitro transformation assay. Genotoxic activity was observed in the mouse \nlymphoma assay, and at doses of 20-200 mg/kg in a mouse micronucleus assay. A dominant lethal assay \nin rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted through male \ngametes.\n\nConventional carcinogenicity rodent studies with low exposures compared to human exposure under \ntherapeutic conditions (factor 0.1 in rats and 1 in mice) did not reveal tumorigenicity of ribavirin. In \naddition, in a 26 week carcinogenicity study using the heterozygous p53(+/-) mouse model, ribavirin \ndid not produce tumours at the maximally tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg (plasma exposure factor \napproximately 2.5 compared to human exposure). These studies suggest that a carcinogenic potential \nof ribavirin in humans is unlikely.\n\nRibavirin plus interferon\nWhen used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, ribavirin did not cause any \neffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. The major treatment-related change \nwas a reversible mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by \neither active substance alone.\n\n6.

Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the \nHIV infection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or \nnot your Rebetol treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients receiving \nzidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons could be at increased \nrisk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). Therefore the use of \nzidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons is not recommended.\n\n\uf02d Due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis,\nthe use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of ribavirin and \nstavudine should be avoided.\n\n\uf02d Co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving cART may be at increased \nrisk of worsening liver function. Adding treatment with an alpha interferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cOther medicines\" section of the Package Leaflet for the other medicines \nused in combination with Rebetol before you begin combination treatment with this \nmedicine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant, you must not take this medicine.

This should be discussed with your doctor. \n\n- Men:\nDo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the \npossibility for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. \nIf your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for \npregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. \nYou or your female partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking \nRebetol and for 7 months after stopping treatment.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\nThis Package Leaflet contains information for the paediatric patient (child or adolescent, 3 through \n17 years of age), or for his or her parent or caregiver.\n\n1. What Rebetol is and what it is used for\n\nRebetol contains the active substance ribavirin. This medicine stops the multiplication of hepatitis C \nvirus. Rebetol must not be used alone.\n\nThe combination of Rebetol and other medicines is used to treat patients who have chronic hepatitis C \n(HCV).\nRebetol may be used in paediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents), who \nare not previously treated and without severe liver disease.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Rebetol \n\nDo not take Rebetol\nDo not take Rebetol if any of the following apply to you or the child you are caring for.\n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebetol.\n\uf0b7 are allergic to ribavirin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\uf0b7 are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d).\n\uf0b7 are breast-feeding.\n\uf0b7 had a serious heart problem during the past 6 months.\n\uf0b7 have any blood disorders, such as anaemia (low blood count), thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cDo not take\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for the other medicines used \nin combination  with this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n77\n\nWarnings and precautions\nThere are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of ribavirin with \n(peg)interferon alfa. These include:\n\uf0b7 Psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal thoughts, attempted \n\nsuicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.). Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you \nare becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want \nto consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression \nor changes in your behaviour\n\n\uf0b7 Severe eye disorders\n\uf0b7 Dental and periodontal disorders: Dental and gum disorders have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving Rebetol in combination with (peg)interferon alfa-2b. You should brush your teeth \nthoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may \nexperience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards\n\n\uf0b7 Inability to achieve full adult height may occur in some children and adolescents\n\uf0b7 Increased hormone related to your thyroid (TSH) in children and adolescents\n\nPaediatric population\nIf you are caring for a child and your doctor decides not to defer combination treatment with \npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b until adulthood, it is important to understand that this \ncombination therapy induces a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. \n\nIn addition these events have occurred in patients taking Rebetol:\nHaemolysis: Rebetol can cause a break down in red blood cells causing anaemia which may impair \nyour heart function or worsen symptoms of heart disease.\nPancytopenia: Rebetol can cause a decrease in your platelet and red and white blood cell count when \nused in combination with peginterferon. \n\nStandard blood tests will be taken to check your blood, kidney and liver function.\n- Blood tests will be done regularly to help your doctor to know if this treatment is working.\n- Depending upon the results of these tests, your doctor may change/adjust the number of hard \n\ncapsules you or the child you are caring for take, prescribe a different pack size of this \nmedicine, and/or change the length of time to take this treatment.\n\n- If you have or develop severe kidney or liver problems, this treatment will be stopped.\n\nSeek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as \ndifficulty in breathing, wheezing or hives) while taking this treatment.\n\nTalk to your doctor if you or the child you are caring for:\n\uf0b7 are a woman of childbearing age (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d).\n\uf0b7 are a male and your female partner is of childbearing age (see section \u201cPregnancy and \n\nbreast-feeding\u201d).\n\uf0b7 had a previous heart condition or have heart disease.\n\uf0b7 have another liver problem in addition to hepatitis C infection.\n\uf0b7 have problems with your kidneys.\n\uf0b7 have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or have ever had any other problems with your\n\nimmune system.\n\nPlease refer to the Package Leaflet of (peg)interferon alfa for more detailed information on these \nsafety issues.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for the other \nmedicines used in combination with Rebetol before you begin combination treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\nOther medicines with Rebetol\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for are taking, have recently taken or \nmight take:\n- azathioprine is a medicine that suppresses your immune system, using this medicine in \n\ncombination with Rebetol may increase your risk of developing severe blood disorders.\n- anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) medicines - [nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NRTI), and/or combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART)]:\n\uf02d Taking this medicine in combination with an alpha interferon and an anti-HIV medicine\n\nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities \ndevelopment (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white \nblood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets).\n\n\uf02d With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if this medicine will change the way \nthese medicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the \nHIV infection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or \nnot your Rebetol treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients receiving \nzidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons could be at increased \nrisk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). Therefore the use of \nzidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons is not recommended.\n\n\uf02d Due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis,\nthe use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of ribavirin and \nstavudine should be avoided.\n\n\uf02d Co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving cART may be at increased \nrisk of worsening liver function. Adding treatment with an alpha interferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cOther medicines\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for the other medicines \nused in combination with Rebetol before you begin combination treatment with this \nmedicine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, you must not take this medicine. This medicine can be very damaging to your \nunborn baby (embryo).\n\nBoth female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \npossibility for pregnancy to occur:\n- Girl or woman of childbearing age:\n\nYou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and \nfor the 4 months after treatment is stopped. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n\n- Men:\nDo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the \npossibility for ribavirin to be left in the woman\u2019s body. \nIf your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for \npregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. \nYou or your female partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking \nRebetol and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with your doctor \n(see section \u201cDo not take Rebetol\u201d). \n\nIf you are a woman who is breast-feeding, you must not take this medicine. Discontinue \nbreast-feeding before starting to take this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive or use machines; however, other medicines used in \ncombination with Rebetol may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Therefore, do not drive or \nuse machines if you become tired, sleepy, or confused from this treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n79\n\nRebetol contains sucrose and sorbitol\nThis medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol, these are types of sugars. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\n3.

The recommended dose of Rebetol combined with \ninterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b, is shown in the below table. \n\nRebetol oral solution -\nUsual dosage to be used with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b in children above 3 years of \nage and adolescents\nIf the patient weighs this many kg Measure and give this dose\n\nMorning Dose Evening Dose\n10-12 2 mL 2 mL\n13-14 3 mL 2 mL\n15-17 3 mL 3 mL\n18-20 4 mL 3 mL\n21-22 4 mL 4 mL\n23-25 5 mL 4 mL\n26-28 5 mL 5 mL\n29-31 6 mL 5 mL\n32-33 6 mL 6 mL\n34-36 7 mL 6 mL\n37-39 7 mL 7 mL\n40-41 8 mL 7 mL\n42-44 8 mL 8 mL\n45-47 9 mL 8 mL\n\n1.

Insert the assembled dosing syringe into the bottle of Rebetol oral \nsolution.\n\nB. While keeping the tip in the liquid, pull the rod out. As the solution \nfills the syringe, you will see the numbers on the rod go up, such as \n1.5 mL, 2.0 mL, 2.5 mL, etc.\n\nReminder: Your doctor may have changed the amount based on \nrecent test results.\n\nC. Pull the rod out until you can read the correct number of mL for the \ndose you are measuring.\n\nD. Take the oral syringe out of the bottle and check to see that the correct \namount appears in the bottom of the syringe. If you have too much or \ntoo little, try again until you have the correct amount.\n\n2. Deliver: Try not to let the oral syringe touch the inside of the mouth.\nHold the syringe to your mouth and release the dose into your mouth (or \nthe mouth of the patient you are caring for) by pushing in the rod. \nSwallow the dose.\n\n3. Rinse: If the syringe has touched the inside of the mouth, rinse it with water \nbefore inserting it in the bottle again.\nThe syringe should be rinsed with water after each use to avoid \nstickiness.\n\n4.

and breast-feeding\"). are breast-feeding. had a serious heart problem during the past 6 months. have any blood disorders, such as anaemia (low blood count), thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia. reminder: please read the \"do not take\" section of the package leaflet for the other medicines used in combination with this medicine. warnings and precautions there are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of ribavirin with (peg)interferon alfa. these include: psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.). be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. you may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour severe eye disorders dental and periodontal disorders: dental and gum disorders have been reported in patients receiving rebetol in combination with (peg)interferon alfa-2b. you should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. in addition some patients may experience vomiting. if you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards inability to achieve full adult height may occur in some children and adolescents increased hormone related to your thyroid (tsh) in children and adolescents paediatric population if you are caring for a child and your doctor decides not to defer combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b until adulthood, it is important to understand that this combination therapy induces a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. in addition these events have occurred in patients taking rebetol: haemolysis: rebetol can cause a break down in red blood cells causing anaemia which may impair your heart function or worsen symptoms of heart disease. pancytopenia: rebetol can cause a decrease in your platelet and red and white blood cell count when used in combination with peginterferon. standard blood tests will be taken to check your blood, kidney and liver function. - blood tests will be done regularly to help your doctor to know if this treatment is working. - depending upon the results of these tests, your doctor may change/adjust the number of hard capsules you or the child you are caring for take, prescribe a different pack size of this medicine, and/or change the length of time to take this treatment. - if you have or develop severe kidney or liver problems, this treatment will be stopped. seek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or hives) while taking this treatment. talk to your doctor if you or the child you are caring for: are a woman of childbearing age (see section \"pregnancy and breast-feeding\"). are a male and your female partner is of childbearing age (see section \"pregnancy and breast-feeding\"). had a previous heart condition or have heart disease. have another liver problem in addition to hepatitis c infection. have problems with your kidneys. have hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) or have ever had any other problems with your immune system. please refer to the package leaflet of (peg)interferon alfa for more detailed information on these safety issues. reminder: please read the \"warnings and precautions\" section of the package leaflet for the other medicines used in combination with rebetol before you begin combination treatment. use in children and adolescents if the child is weighing less than 47 kg or unable to swallow an oral solution of rebetol is available. other medicines with rebetol tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for are taking, have recently taken or might take: - azathioprine is a medicine that suppresses your immune system, using this medicine in combination with rebetol may increase your risk of developing severe blood disorders. - anti-human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) medicines - [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti), and/or combined anti-retroviral therapy (cart)]: taking this medicine in combination with an alpha interferon and an anti-hiv medicine may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities development (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets). - with zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if this medicine will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not your rebetol treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients receiving zidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons is not recommended. due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis, the use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of ribavirin and stavudine should be avoided. co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving cart may be at increased risk of worsening liver function. adding treatment with an alpha interferon alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. reminder: please read the \"other medicines\" section of the package leaflet for the other medicines used in combination with rebetol before you begin combination treatment with this medicine. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant, you must not take this medicine. this medicine can be very damaging to your unborn baby (embryo). both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any possibility for pregnancy to occur: - girl or woman of childbearing age: you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. this should be discussed with your doctor. - men: do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. this will lessen the possibility for ribavirin to be left in the woman's body. if your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. you or your female partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking rebetol and for 7 months after stopping treatment. this should be discussed with your doctor (see section \"do not take rebetol\"). if you are a woman who is breast-feeding, you must not take this medicine. discontinue breast-feeding before starting to take this medicine. driving and using machines this medicine does not affect your ability to drive or use machines; however, other medicines
