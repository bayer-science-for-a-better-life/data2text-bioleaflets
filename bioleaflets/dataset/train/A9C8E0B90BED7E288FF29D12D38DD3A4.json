This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nElebrato Ellipta 92 micrograms/55 micrograms/22 micrograms inhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single inhalation provides a delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece) of 92 micrograms \nfluticasone furoate, 65 micrograms umeclidinium bromide equivalent to 55 micrograms umeclidinium and \n22 micrograms vilanterol (as trifenatate). This corresponds to a pre-dispensed dose of 100 micrograms \nfluticasone furoate, 74.2 micrograms umeclidinium bromide equivalent to 62.5 micrograms umeclidinium \nand 25 micrograms vilanterol (as trifenatate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach delivered dose contains approximately 25 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). \n \nWhite powder in a light grey inhaler (Ellipta) with a beige mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nElebrato Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled \ncorticosteroid and a long-acting \u03b22-agonist or a combination of a long-acting \u03b22-agonist and a long-acting \nmuscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptom control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \n \nThe recommended and maximum dose is one inhalation of Elebrato Ellipta 92/55/22 micrograms once daily, \nat the same time each day. \n \nIf a dose is missed the next dose should be inhaled at the usual time the next day. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Elebrato \nEllipta should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Elebrato Ellipta in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the \nindication of COPD. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nElebrato Ellipta is for inhalation use only. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \nThe following instructions for the 30 dose (30 day supply) Ellipta inhaler also apply to the 14 dose (14 day \nsupply) Ellipta inhaler. \n \n \na) Prepare a dose \n \nOpen the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. \n \nSlide the cover down fully until a \u201cclick\u201d is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. \n \nThe dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the \u201cclick\u201d is \nheard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. \n \nb) How to inhale the medicinal product \n \nThe inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable, but not breathing out \ninto the inhaler. \n \nThe mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. The \nair vents should not be blocked with fingers during use. \n \n\n\u2022 Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as possible (at \nleast 3-4 seconds). \n\n\u2022 Remove the inhaler from the mouth. \n\u2022 Breathe out slowly and gently. \n\n \nThe medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. \n \nThe mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. \n \nc) Close the inhaler and rinse your mouth \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nSlide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece. \n \nRinse your mouth with water after you have used the inhaler, do not swallow.  \n \nThis will make it less likely to develop a sore mouth or throat as side effects. \n \nFor further instructions on handling the device, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAsthma  \n \nElebrato Ellipta should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient \npopulation. \n \nNot for acute use \n \nThere are no clinical data to support the use of Elebrato Ellipta for the treatment of acute episodes of \nbronchospasm, or to treat an acute COPD exacerbation (i.e. as a rescue therapy). \n \nDeterioration of disease \n \nIncreasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms may indicate deterioration of disease \ncontrol. In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with Elebrato Ellipta, a re-evaluation of the \npatient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken. \n \nPatients should not stop therapy with Elebrato Ellipta without physician supervision since symptoms may \nrecur after discontinuation. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \n \nAdministration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol may produce paradoxical bronchospasm with \nan immediate wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing and may be life-threatening. Treatment with \nElebrato Ellipta should be discontinued immediately if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. The patient should \nbe assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. \n \nCardiovascular effects  \n \nCardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after \nthe administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including umeclidinium and \nvilanterol, respectively. Therefore, Elebrato Ellipta should be used with caution in patients with unstable or \nlife-threatening cardiovascular disease. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment receiving Elebrato Ellipta should be monitored for \nsystemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 5.2). \n \nSystemic corticosteroid effects \n \nSystemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long \nperiods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nVisual disturbance  \n \nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with \nsymptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to \nan ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases \nsuch as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical \ncorticosteroids. \n \nCoexisting conditions  \n \nElebrato Ellipta should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in \npatients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. \n \nElebrato Ellipta should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in patients \nwith chronic or untreated infections. \n \nAnticholinergic activity \n \nElebrato Ellipta should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention. \nPatients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma and should be \ninformed to stop using Elebrato Ellipta and to contact their doctor immediately should any of these signs or \nsymptoms develop. \n \nPneumonia in patients with COPD \n \nAn increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been \nobserved in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an increased \nrisk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all \nstudies. \n \nThere is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk \namong inhaled corticosteroid products. \n \nPhysicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the \nclinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. \n \nRisk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass index \n(BMI) and severe COPD. \n \nHypokalaemia \n \nBeta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the potential to \nproduce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring \nsupplementation.  \n \nNo clinically relevant effects of hypokalaemia were observed in clinical studies with Elebrato Ellipta at the \nrecommended therapeutic dose. Caution should be exercised when Elebrato Ellipta is used with other \nmedicinal products that also have the potential to cause hypokalaemia (see section 4.5). \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nBeta2-adrenergic agonists may produce transient hyperglycaemia in some patients. No clinically relevant \neffects on plasma glucose were observed in clinical studies with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol \nat the recommended therapeutic dose. There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in \ndiabetic patients treated with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol and this should be considered when \n\n\n\n6 \n\nprescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. Upon initiation of treatment with Elebrato Ellipta, \nplasma glucose should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients. \n \nExcipients  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nClinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol at clinical \ndoses are considered unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. \n \nInteraction with beta-blockers \n \nBeta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, such as \nvilanterol. If beta-blockers are required, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, however, \ncaution should be exercised during concurrent use of both non-selective and selective beta-blockers. \n \nInteraction with CYP3A4 inhibitor \n \nFluticasone furoate and vilanterol are rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by enzyme \nCYP3A4. \n \nCaution is advised when co-administering with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, \ncobicistat-containing products) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both fluticasone \nfuroate and vilanterol, which could lead to an increased potential for adverse reactions. Co-administration \nshould be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid adverse \nreactions, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid adverse reactions. A repeat \ndose study was performed in healthy subjects with the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination \n(184/22 micrograms) and ketoconazole (400 milligrams, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Co-administration \nincreased mean fluticasone furoate AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 36% and 33%, respectively. The increase in \nfluticasone furoate exposure was associated with a 27% reduction in 0-24 hours weighted mean serum \ncortisol. Co-administration increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) and Cmax by 65% and 22%, respectively. The \nincrease in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an increase in beta2-agonist related systemic effects \non heart rate or blood potassium. \n \nInteraction with CYP2D6 inhibitors/CYP2D6 polymorphism \n \nUmeclidinium is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state pharmacokinetics of \numeclidinium was assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers). No effect on \numeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a dose 8-fold higher than the therapeutic dose. An \napproximately 1.3-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed at 16-fold higher dose with no effect on \numeclidinium Cmax. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is \nexpected when fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or \nwhen administered to patients who are genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers). \n \nInteraction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors \n \nFluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol are substrates of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp). The \neffect of the moderate P-gp inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of \numeclidinium and vilanterol was assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on \numeclidinium or vilanterol Cmax. An approximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed \nwith no effect on vilanterol AUC. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug \ninteraction is expected when fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is co-administered with P-gp \ninhibitors. Clinical pharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone furoate have not been \nconducted. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nOther long acting antimuscarinics and long acting beta2- adrenergic agonists \n \nCo-administration of Elebrato Ellipta with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists or long-acting beta2- \nadrenergic agonists has not been studied and is not recommended as it may potentiate the adverse reactions \n(see sections 4.8 and 4.9). \n \nHypokalaemia \n \nConcomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-sparing \ndiuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, therefore caution \nshould be exercised (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nAdministration of Elebrato Ellipta to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to \nthe mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, vilanterol or their metabolites are excreted in \nhuman milk.  However, other corticosteroids, muscarinic antagonists and beta2-adrenergic agonists are \ndetected in human milk.  A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  A decision must be made whether \nto discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Elebrato Ellipta therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol on human fertility.  Animal \nstudies indicate no effects of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol on male or female fertility (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Elebrato Ellipta were nasopharyngitis (7%), headache \n(5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (2%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe safety profile of Elebrato Ellipta is based on three phase III clinical studies. \n \nThe first study included safety data from 911 patients with COPD who received fluticasone \nfuroate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 92/55/22 micrograms, once daily, for up to 24 weeks, of whom 210 patients \nreceived fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 92/55/22 micrograms once daily for up to 52 weeks, \nwith an active comparator (study CTT116853, FULFIL). \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe second study included safety data from 527 patients with COPD who received fluticasone \nfuroate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (92/55/22 micrograms) and 528 patients with COPD who received \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol (92/22 micrograms) + umeclidinium (55 micrograms) once daily for up to \n24 weeks (study 200812). \n \nThe third study included safety data from 4,151 patients with COPD who received fluticasone \nfuroate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 92/55/22 micrograms once daily for up to 52 weeks, with two active \ncomparators (study CTT116855, IMPACT). \n \nWhere adverse reaction frequencies differed between studies, the higher frequency is reported below. \n \nAdverse reactions detected during these clinical trials are listed by MedDRA system organ class. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n  \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions \n \n\nFrequency \n\nInfections and infestations Pneumonia \nUpper respiratory tract infection \nBronchitis \nPharyngitis \nRhinitis \nSinusitis  \nInfluenza  \nNasopharyngitis \nCandidiasis of mouth and throat \nUrinary tract infection \n\nCommon \n\nViral respiratory tract infection Uncommon \nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nEye disorders Vision blurred (see section 4.4) Not known \nCardiac disorders Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia \n\nTachycardia \nAtrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic & \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough \nOropharyngeal pain \n\nCommon \n\nDysphonia Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nConstipation Common \nDry mouth Uncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia \nBack pain \n\nCommon \n\nFractures Uncommon \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPneumonia  \nIn a total of 1810 patients with advanced COPD (mean post bronchodilatory screening FEV1 45% of \npredicted, standard deviation (SD) 13%), 65% of whom had experienced a moderate/severe COPD \nexacerbation in the year prior to study entry (study CTT116853), there was a higher incidence of pneumonia \nevents reported up to 24 weeks in patients receiving Elebrato Ellipta (20 patients, 2%) than in patients \nreceiving budesonide/formoterol (7 patients, <1%).  Pneumonia which required hospitalisation occurred in \n1% of patients receiving Elebrato Ellipta and <1% of patients receiving budesonide/formoterol up to 24 \nweeks. One fatal case of pneumonia was reported in a patient who received Elebrato Ellipta. In the subset of \n430 patients treated for up to 52 weeks, the incidence of pneumonia events reported in both Elebrato Ellipta \n\n\n\n9 \n\nand budesonide/formoterol arms was equal at 2%. The incidence of pneumonia with Elebrato Ellipta is \ncomparable with that observed in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 arm of FF/VI clinical \nstudies in COPD. \n \nIn a 52-week study, with a total of 10,355 patients with COPD and a history of moderate or severe \nexacerbations within the prior 12 months (mean post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 46% of predicted, SD \n15%) (study CTT116855), the incidence of pneumonia was 8% (317 patients) for Elebrato Ellipta \n(n = 4,151), 7% (292 subjects) for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (n = 4,134), and 5% (97 subjects) for \numeclidinium/vilanterol (n = 2,070). Fatal pneumonia occurred in 12 of 4,151 patients (3.5 per 1,000 patient-\nyears) receiving Elebrato Ellipta, 5 of 4,134 patients (1.7 per 1,000 patient-years) receiving fluticasone \nfuroate/vilanterol, and 5 of 2,070 patients (2.9 per 1,000 patient-years) receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAn overdose will likely produce signs, symptoms or adverse effects associated with the individual \ncomponents\u2019 pharmacological actions (e.g. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, \ndecrease in bone mineral density, dry mouth, visual accommodation disturbances, tachycardia, arrhythmias, \ntremor, headache, palpitations, nausea, hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia). \n \nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose with Elebrato Ellipta. If overdose occurs, the patient should be \ntreated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n \nCardioselective beta-blockade should only be considered for profound vilanterol overdose effects that are \nclinically concerning and unresponsive to supportive measures. Cardioselective beta-blocking medicinal \nproducts should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. \n \nFurther management should be clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where \navailable.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with \nanticholinergics including triple combinations with corticosteroids, ATC code: R03AL08. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is a combination of inhaled synthetic corticosteroid, long-acting \nmuscarinic receptor antagonist and long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA). Following oral \ninhalation, umeclidinium and vilanterol act locally on airways to produce bronchodilation by separate \nmechanisms and fluticasone furoate reduces inflammation. \n \nFluticasone furoate \nFluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism \nthrough which fluticasone furoate affects COPD symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown \nto have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and \nmediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines) involved in inflammation.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nUmeclidinium \nUmeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic). \nUmeclidinium exerts its bronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine \nwith muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 \nmuscarinic receptor subtype in vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the \nlungs in pre-clinical models. \n \nVilanterol \nVilanterol is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA). The pharmacologic effects of \nbeta2-adrenergic agonists, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular \nadenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-\nadenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth \nmuscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast \ncells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \nThe effect of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol on the QT interval has not been evaluated in a \nthorough QT (TQT) study. TQT studies for FF/VI and umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) did not show \nclinically relevant effects on QT interval at clinical doses of FF, UMEC and VI. \n \nNo clinically relevant effects on the QTc interval were observed on review of centrally read ECGs from 911 \nsubjects with COPD exposed to fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol for up to 24 weeks, or in the \nsubset of 210 subjects exposed for up to 52 weeks. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Elebrato Ellipta (92/55/22 micrograms), administered as a once-daily treatment, has been \nevaluated in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD in two, active-controlled studies and in a single, non-\ninferiority study. All three studies were multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies that required patients \nto be symptomatic with a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score \u226510 and on daily maintenance treatment for \ntheir COPD for at least three months prior to study entry. \n \nFULFIL (CTT116853) was a 24-week study (N=1,810), with an extension up to 52 weeks in a subset of \nsubjects (n=430), that compared Elebrato Ellipta (92/55/22 micrograms) with budesonide/formoterol \n400/12 micrograms (BUD/FOR) administered twice-daily. At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator \npercent predicted FEV1 was 45% and 65% of patients reported a history of one or more moderate/severe \nexacerbation in the past year. \n \nIMPACT (CTT116855) was a 52-week study (N=10,355) that compared Elebrato Ellipta \n(92/55/22 micrograms) with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms (FF/VI) and \numeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 micrograms (UMEC/VI). At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator percent \npredicted FEV1 was 46% and over 99% of patients reported a history of one or more moderate/severe \nexacerbation in the past year. \n \nAt study entry, the most common COPD medications reported in the FULFIL and IMPACT studies were \nICS +LABA+LAMA (28%, 34% respectively), ICS+LABA (29%, 26% respectively), LAMA+LABA (10%, \n8% respectively) and LAMA (9%, 7% respectively). These patients may have also been taking other COPD \nmedications (e.g. mucolytics or leukotriene receptor antagonists). \n  \nStudy 200812 was a 24-week, non-inferiority study (N=1,055) that compared Elebrato Ellipta \n(92/55/22 micrograms) with FF/VI (92/22 micrograms) + UMEC (55 micrograms), co-administered once \ndaily as a multi-inhaler therapy in patients with a history of moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior \n12 months. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nLung Function \nIn FULFIL, bronchodilatory effects with Elebrato Ellipta were evident on the first day of treatment and were \nmaintained over the 24-week treatment period (mean changes from baseline in FEV1 were 90-222 mL on \nday 1 and 160-339 mL at week 24). Elebrato Ellipta significantly improved (p<0.001) lung function (as \ndefined by mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 24) (see Table 1) and the improvement was \nmaintained in the subset of patients who continued treatment to week 52. \n \nTable 1.

The pre-specified non-inferiority \nmargin was 50 mL. \n \nExacerbations \nIn IMPACT, over 52 weeks, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p<0.001) the annual rate of \nmoderate/severe exacerbations by 15% (95% CI:10, 20) compared with FF/VI (rate; 0.91 vs 1.07 events per \npatient year) and by 25% (95% CI: 19, 30) compared with UMEC/VI (rate; 0.91 vs 1.21 events per patient \nyear). In FULFIL, based upon data up to 24 weeks, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p=0.002) the \nannual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations by 35% (95% CI: 14, 51) compared with BUD/FOR. \n\nIn IMPACT, Elebrato Ellipta prolonged the time to first moderate/severe exacerbation and significantly \ndecreased (p<0.001) the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation, as measured by time to first exacerbation, \ncompared with both FF/VI (14.8%; 95% CI: 9.3, 19.9) and UMEC/VI (16.0%; 95% CI: 9.4, 22.1). In \nFULFIL, Elebrato Ellipta significantly decreased the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation compared with \nBUD/FOR over 24 weeks (33%; 95% CI: 12, 48; p=0.004). \n\nIn IMPACT, treatment with Elebrato Ellipta reduced the annual rate of severe exacerbations (i.e., requiring \nhospitalisation or resulting in death) by 13% compared with FF/VI (95% CI: -1, 24; p=0.064). Treatment \nwith Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced the annual rate of severe exacerbations by 34% compared with \nUMEC/VI (95% CI: 22, 44; p<0.001). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nHealth-Related Quality of Life \nElebrato Ellipta significantly improved (p<0.001) Health Related Quality of Life (as measured by the St \nGeorge\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ] total score) in both FULFIL (week 24) when compared with \nBUD/FOR (-2.2 units; 95% CI: -3.5, -1.0) and IMPACT (week 52) when compared with FF/VI (-1.8 units; \n95% CI: -2.4, -1.1) and UMEC/VI (-1.8 units; 95% CI: -2.6, -1.0). \n \nA higher percentage of patients receiving Elebrato Ellipta responded with a clinically meaningful \nimprovement in SGRQ total score in FULFIL at week 24 compared with BUD/FOR (50% and 41% \nrespectively), odds ratios of response vs. non-response (OR) (1.41; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.70) and in IMPACT at \nweek 52 compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI (42%, 34% and 34% respectively), OR vs. FF/VI (1.41; 95% \nCI:1.29, 1.55) and OR vs. UMEC/VI (1.41; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.57); all treatment comparisons were statistically \nsignificant (p<0.001). \n\nIn FULFIL, the proportion of patients who were CAT responders (defined as 2 units below baseline or \nlower) at week 24, was significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients treated with Elebrato Ellipta compared \nwith BUD/FOR (53% vs. 45%; OR 1.44; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.75). In IMPACT, the proportion of patients \nwho were CAT responders at week 52 was significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients treated with \nElebrato Ellipta (42%) compared with FF/VI (37%; OR 1.24; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.36) and UMEC/VI (36%; \nOR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.43). \n \nSymptom Relief \nBreathlessness was measured using the Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score at week 24 in FULFIL \nand week 52 in IMPACT (a subset of patients, n=5,058). In FULFIL the proportion of responders according \nto TDI (defined as at least 1 unit) was significantly higher (p<0.001) for Elebrato Ellipta compared with \nBUD/FOR (61% vs 51%; OR 1.61; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.95). In IMPACT, the proportion of responders was also \nsignificantly higher (p<0.001) for Elebrato Ellipta (36%) compared with FF/VI (29%; OR 1.36; 95% CI: \n1.19, 1.55) and UMEC/VI (30%; OR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.57). \n\nIn FULFIL, Elebrato Ellipta improved daily symptoms of COPD as assessed by E-RS: COPD total score, \ncompared with BUD/FOR (\u22652 unit decrease from baseline). The proportion of responders during weeks \n21-24 was significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients treated with Elebrato Ellipta compared with BUD/FOR \n(47% and 37% respectively; OR 1.59; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.94). \n \nUse of Rescue Medication \nIn FULFIL, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p<0.001) the use of rescue medication between weeks \n1-24 compared with BUD/FOR (treatment difference: -0.2 occasions per day; 95% CI: -0.3, -0.1). \n \nIn IMPACT, Elebrato Ellipta significantly reduced (p<0.001) the use of rescue medication (occasions per \nday) at each 4-week time period compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI. At weeks 49-52, the treatment \ndifference was -0.28 (95% CI: -0.37, -0.19) when compared with FF/VI and -0.30 (95% CI: -0.41, -0.19) \nwith UMEC/VI. \n \nNighttime awakenings \nIn IMPACT, Elebrato Ellipta statistically significantly reduced the mean number of nighttime awakenings \ndue to COPD compared with FF/VI (-0.05; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01; p=0.005) and with UMEC/VI (-0.10; 95% \nCI: -0.14, -0.05; p<0.001) at weeks 49 to 52. Significant reductions were observed over all other timepoints \nfor UMEC/VI (p<0.001) and for the all but two of the of timepoints for FF/VI (p\u22640.021). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Elebrato \nEllipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nWhen fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol were administered in combination by the inhaled \nroute from a single inhaler in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of each component were similar to those \n\n\n\n13 \n\nobserved when each active substance was administered either as fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination \nor as an umeclidinium/vilanterol combination or umeclidinium monotherapy. \n \nPopulation PK analyses for FF/UMEC/VI were conducted using a combined PK dataset from three phase III \nstudies in 821 COPD subjects. Systemic drug levels (steady state Cmax and AUC) of FF, UMEC and VI \nfollowing FF/UMEC/VI in one inhaler (triple combination) were within the range of those observed \nfollowing FF/VI + UMEC as two inhalers, dual combinations (FF/VI and UMEC/VI), as well as individual \nsingle inhalers (FF, UMEC and VI). Covariate analysis showed higher FF apparent clearance (42%) when \ncomparing FF/VI to FF/UMEC/VI; however, this is not considered clinically relevant. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFluticasone furoate \nFollowing inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in healthy subjects, \nfluticasone furoate Cmax occurred at 15 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of fluticasone furoate when \nadministrated as fluticasone furoate/vilanterol by inhalation was 15.2%, primarily due to absorption of the \ninhaled portion of the dose delivered to the lung, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. \nFollowing repeat dosing of inhaled fluticasone furoate /vilanterol, steady state was achieved within 6 days \nwith up to 1.6-fold accumulation. \n \nUmeclidinium \nFollowing inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in healthy subjects, \numeclidinium Cmax occurred at 5 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium was on \naverage 13%, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled \numeclidinium, steady state was achieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 2-fold accumulation. \n \nVilanterol \nFollowing inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol in healthy subjects, \nvilanterol Cmax occurred at 7 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled vilanterol was 27%, with \nnegligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol, \nsteady state was achieved within 6 days with up to 1.5-fold accumulation. \n \nDistribution \n \nFluticasone furoate \nFollowing intravenous dosing of fluticasone furoate to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution at \nsteady state of 661 litres. Fluticasone furoate has a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma \nprotein binding in human plasma of fluticasone furoate was high, on average >99.6%. \n \nUmeclidinium  \nFollowing intravenous administration of umeclidinium to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of \ndistribution was 86 litres. In vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%. \n \nVilanterol \nFollowing intravenous administration of vilanterol to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution at \nsteady state was 165 litres. Vilanterol has a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma protein \nbinding in human plasma was on average 94%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFluticasone furoate \nIn vitro studies showed that fluticasone furoate is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(CYP3A4) and is a substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic route for fluticasone furoate is \nhydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate group to metabolites with significantly reduced corticosteroid \nactivity. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nUmeclidinium \nIn vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and \nis a substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium are oxidative \n(hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of \nmetabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not \nbeen established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. \n \nVilanterol \nIn vitro studies showed that vilanterol is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is a \nsubstrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for vilanterol are O-dealkylation to a range \nof metabolites with significantly reduced beta1- and beta2-adrenergic agonist activity. Plasma metabolic \nprofiles following oral administration of vilanterol in a human radiolabel study were consistent with high \nfirst-pass metabolism. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. \n \nElimination \n \nFluticasone furoate \nThe apparent plasma elimination half-life of fluticasone furoate following inhaled administration of \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol was, on average, 24 hours. Following intravenous administration, the \nelimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Plasma clearance following intravenous administration was \n65.4 litres/hour. Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 2 % of the intravenously administered dose. \nFollowing oral administration, fluticasone furoate was eliminated in humans mainly by metabolism with \nmetabolites being excreted almost exclusively in faeces, with <1% of the recovered radioactive dose \neliminated in the urine. \n \nUmeclidinium  \nUmeclidinium plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours, with 3% \nto 4% active substance excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state. Plasma clearance following intravenous \nadministration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous administration, approximately 58% of the \nadministered radiolabelled dose was excreted in faeces and approximately 22% of the administered \nradiolabelled dose was excreted in urine. The excretion of the drug-related material in the faeces following \nintravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following oral administration, 92% of the administered \nradiolabelled dose was excreted primarily in faeces. Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of \nrecovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting negligible absorption following oral \nadministration. \n \nVilanterol \nVilanterol plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 11 hours. Plasma \nclearance of vilanterol following intravenous administration was 108 litres/hour. Following oral \nadministration of radiolabelled vilanterol, 70% of the radiolabel was excreted in urine and 30% in faeces. \nPrimary elimination of vilanterol was by metabolism followed by excretion of metabolites in urine and \nfaeces. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly \nThe effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol were \nevaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No clinically relevant effects requiring dose \nadjustment were observed. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol has not been evaluated in subjects with renal \nimpairment. However, studies have been conducted with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and \numeclidinium/vilanterol that showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate, \numeclidinium or vilanterol. In vitro protein binding studies between subjects with severe renal impairment \n\n\n\n15 \n\nand healthy volunteers were conducted, and no clinically significant evidence of altered protein binding was \nseen.  \n \nThe effects of haemodialysis have not been studied.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic \nimpairment. However, studies have been conducted with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and \numeclidinium/vilanterol. \n \nThe fluticasone furoate/vilanterol component of Elebrato Ellipta was assessed in patients with all severities \nof hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B or C). For fluticasone furoate, patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment showed up to three times higher systemic exposure (FF 184 micrograms); therefore, patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment received half the dose (FF 92 micrograms). At this dose, no effects on \nsystemic exposure were observed. Therefore, caution is advised in moderate to severe hepatic impairment, \nbut no specific dose adjustment based on hepatic function is recommended. There was no significant \nincrease in systemic exposure to vilanterol. \n \nPatients with moderate hepatic impairment showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to either \numeclidinium or vilanterol (Cmax and AUC). Umeclidinium has not been evaluated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \nOther special populations \nThe effects of race, gender and weight on the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and \nvilanterol were also evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  \n \nIn 113 East Asian subjects with COPD (Japanese and East Asian Heritage), who received FF/UMEC/VI \nfrom a single inhaler (27% subjects), fluticasone furoate AUC(ss) estimates were on average 30% higher \ncompared with Caucasian subjects. However, these higher systemic exposures remain below the threshold \nfor FF-induced reduction of serum and urine cortisol and are not considered clinically relevant. \nThere was no effect of race on pharmacokinetic parameters of umeclidinium or vilanterol in subjects with \nCOPD. \n \nNo clinically relevant differences requiring dose adjustment based on race, gender or weight were observed \nin fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol systemic exposure. \n \nIn terms of other patient characteristics, a study in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers showed no evidence of a \nclinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism on systemic exposure to umeclidinium.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nPharmacological and toxicological effects seen with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol in \nnonclinical studies were those typically associated with glucocorticoids, muscarinic receptor antagonists, or \nbeta2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Administration of combined fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and \nvilanterol to dogs did not result in any significant new toxicity or any major exacerbation of expected \nfindings associated with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium or vilanterol alone.  \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nFluticasone furoate \nFluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime \ninhalation studies in rats or mice at exposures of 1.4- or 2.9-fold, respectively, those seen in humans at a \ndaily dose of 92 micrograms fluticasone furoate, based on AUC.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nUmeclidinium \nUmeclidinium was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime \ninhalation studies in mice or rats at exposures \u2265 20- or \u2265 17- fold the human clinical exposure at a daily dose \nof 55 micrograms umeclidinium, based on AUC respectively. \n \nVilanterol \nVilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic indicating that vilanterol \n(as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans. Consistent with findings for other beta2 \nagonists, in lifetime inhalation studies vilanterol trifenatate caused proliferative effects in the female rat and \nmouse reproductive tract and rat pituitary gland. There was no increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at \nexposures 0.9- or 22-fold, respectively, the human clinical exposure of vilanterol at a daily dose of \n22 micrograms based on AUC. \n \nToxicity to reproduction \n \nFluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol did not have any adverse effects on male or female fertility \nin rats.  \n \nFluticasone furoate \nFluticasone furoate was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but delayed development in rats and caused \nabortion in rabbits at maternally toxic doses. There were no effects on development in rats at exposures 6.6-\nfold the human clinical exposure at a daily dose of 92 micrograms, based on AUC. Fluticasone furoate had \nno adverse effect on pre- or post-natal development in rats.  \n \nUmeclidinium \nUmeclidinium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous \nadministration of umeclidinium to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption \nand slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 180 micrograms/kg/day dose \n(approximately 61-fold the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium at a daily dose of 55 micrograms, \nbased on AUC). \n \nVilanterol \nVilanterol was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol caused effects similar to \nthose seen with other beta2-adrenergic agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb \nflexure/malrotation). When given subcutaneously there were no effects at exposures 62-fold the human \nclinical exposure at a daily dose of 22 micrograms, based on AUC. Vilanterol had no adverse effect on pre- \nor post-natal development in rats.  \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \nStep-by-step instructions \n \n \n1. What Elebrato Ellipta is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Elebrato Ellipta is \n \nElebrato Ellipta contains three active substances called fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and \nvilanterol. Fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called \nsteroids. Umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. \n \nWhat Elebrato Ellipta is used for \n \nElebrato Ellipta is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a long-\nterm condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.  \n \nIn COPD the muscles around the airways tighten, making breathing difficult. This medicine widens these \nmuscles in the lungs, reducing the swelling and irritation in the small air passages and making it easier for air \nto get in and out of the lungs. When used regularly, it can help to control your breathing difficulties and \nreduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.  \n \n\nElebrato Ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or \nother symptoms of COPD. It should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or \nwheezing. If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol). \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you use Elebrato Ellipta  \n \nDon\u2019t use Elebrato Ellipta: \n- if you are allergic to fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, vilanterol or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using Elebrato Ellipta \n- if you have asthma (Don\u2019t use Elebrato Ellipta to treat asthma) \n- if you have heart problems or high blood pressure \n- if you have liver problems \n- if you have tuberculosis (TB) of the lung, or any long standing or untreated infections \n- if you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma \n- if you have an enlarged prostate, difficulty passing urine or a blocking in your bladder \n- if you suffer from epilepsy \n- if you have thyroid gland problems \n- if you have low potassium in your blood \n- if you have a history of diabetes \n- if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances \n\n \nCheck with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you. \n\n \nImmediate breathing difficulties \nIf you get tightness of the chest, coughing, wheezing or breathlessness immediately after using your Elebrato \nEllipta inhaler: \n\nStop using this medicine and seek medical help immediately, as you may have a serious condition \ncalled paradoxical bronchospasm. \n\n \nEye problems during treatment with Elebrato Ellipta \nIf you get eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or coloured images as well as \nred eyes during treatment with Elebrato Ellipta: \n  \n\nStop using this medicine and seek medical help immediately, these may be signs of an acute \nattack of narrow-angle glaucoma. \n\n \nInfection of the lung \nBecause you are using this medicine for COPD you may be at an increased risk of developing an infection of \nthe lungs known as pneumonia.

fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol. fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called steroids. umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. what elebrato ellipta is used for elebrato ellipta is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in adults. copd is a long- term condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse. in copd the muscles around the airways tighten, making breathing difficult. this medicine widens these muscles in the lungs, reducing the swelling and irritation in the small air passages and making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. when used regularly, it can help to control your breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of copd on your everyday life. elebrato ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or other symptoms of copd. it should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. if you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol).", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "elebrato ellipta", "Type":

important that you use elebrato ellipta every day, as instructed by your doctor. this will help to keep you free of symptoms throughout the day and night. elebrato ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. if you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). how to use the inhaler see 'step-by-step instructions' in this leaflet for full information. once the tray is opened elebrato ellipta is ready to use. if your symptoms do not improve if your copd symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough) do not improve or get worse, or if you are using your quick-acting inhaler more often: contact your doctor as soon as possible. if you use more elebrato ellipta than you should if you use too much of this medicine, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice immediately as you may need medical attention. if possible, show them the inhaler, the package or this leaflet. you may notice that your heart is beating faster than usual, you feel shaky, you have visual disturbances, have a dry mouth, or have a headache. if you forget to use elebrato ellipta 35 don't inhale a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. just inhale your next dose at the usual time. if you become wheezy or breathless, use your quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol), then seek medical advice. if you stop using elebrato ellipta use this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. don't stop unless your doctor advises you to, even if you feel better, as your symptoms may get worse. if you have any further
