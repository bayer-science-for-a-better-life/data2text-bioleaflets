NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEurartesim 160 mg/20 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 160 mg piperaquine tetraphosphate (as the tetrahydrate; PQP) and \n20 mg artenimol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite oblong biconvex film-coated tablet (dimension 11.5x5.5mm / thickness 4.4mm) with a \nbreak-line and marked on one side with the letters “S” and “T”. \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEurartesim is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults, \nadolescents, children and infants 6 months and over and weighing 5 kg or more. \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial medicinal \nproducts. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nEurartesim should be administered over three consecutive days for a total of three doses taken at the \nsame time each day.  \n \nDosing should be based on body weight as shown in the table below.  \n \n\nBody weight \n(kg) \n\nDaily dose (mg) \nTablet strength and number of tablets per dose \n\nPQP Artenimol  \n5 to <7 80 10 ½ x 160 mg / 20 mg tablet \n\n7 to <13 160 20 1 x 160 mg / 20 mg tablet \n\n13 to <24 320 40 1 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablet \n\n24 to <36 640 80 2 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets \n\n36 to <75 960 120 3 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets \n\n> 75*  1,280 160 4 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets \n\n  \n* see section 5.1 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n3 \n\n \nIf a patient vomits within 30 minutes of taking Eurartesim, the whole dose should be re-administered; \nif a patient vomits within 30-60 minutes, half the dose should be re-administered. Re-dosing with \nEurartesim should not be attempted more than once. If the second dose is vomited, alternative \nantimalarial therapy should be instituted. \n \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as realised and then the recommended regimen \ncontinued until the full course of treatment has been completed. \n \nThere is no data on a second course of treatment. \nNo more than two courses of Eurartesim may be given within a 12 month period (see sections 4.4 and \n5.3). \nA second course of Eurartesim should not be given within 2 months after the first course due to the \nlong elimination half-life of piperaquine (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nClinical studies of Eurartesim did not include patients aged 65 years and over, therefore no dosing \nrecommendation can be made. Considering the possibility of age-associated decrease in hepatic and \nrenal function, as well as a potential for heart disorders (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), caution should be \nexercised when administering the product to the elderly. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment  \nEurartesim has not been evaluated in subjects with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency. \nTherefore, caution is advised when administering Eurartesim to these patients (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Eurartesim in infants aged less than 6 months and in children weighing less \nthan 5 kg has not been established. No data are available for these paediatric subsets. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEurartesim should be taken orally with water and without food. \nEach dose should be taken no less than 3 hours after the last food intake. \nNo food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose. \nFor patients unable to swallow the tablets, such as infants and young children, Eurartesim may be \ncrushed and mixed with water. The mixture should be used immediately after preparation. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n- Severe malaria according to WHO definition. \n \n- Family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval. \n \n- Known congenital prolongation of the QTc-interval or any clinical condition known to prolong \n\nthe QTc interval. \n \n- History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia. \n \n- Any predisposing cardiac conditions for arrhythmia such as severe hypertension, left ventricular \n\nhypertrophy (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or congestive cardiac failure \naccompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. \n\n \n- Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia. \n \n- Taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval. These include (but are \n\nnot limited to):  \n \n\n• Antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, \nquinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol).  \n\n \n• Neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, \n\nmesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine), antidepressive medicinal products. \n \n• Certain antimicrobial medicinal products, including medicinal products of the following \n\nclasses:  \n− macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin), \n− fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin),  \n− imidazole and triazole antifungal medicinal products,  \n− and also pentamidine and saquinavir. \n\n \n• Certain non-sedating antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine).  \n \n• Cisapride, droperidol, domperidone, bepridil, diphemanil, probucol, levomethadyl, \n\nmethadone, vinca alkaloids, arsenic trioxide.  \n \n\n- Recent treatment with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval that may still be \ncirculating at the time that Eurartesim is commenced (e.g. mefloquine, halofantrine, \nlumefantrine, chloroquine, quinine and other antimalarial medicinal products) taking into \naccount their elimination half-life. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEurartesim should not be used to treat severe falciparum malaria (see section 4.3) and, due to \ninsufficient data, should not be used to treat malaria due to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae \nor Plasmodium ovale. \n \nThe long half-life of piperaquine (about 22 days) should be kept in mind in the event that another anti-\nmalarial agent is started due to treatment failure or a new malaria infection (see below and sections 4.3 \nand 4.5). \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n5 \n\nPiperaquine is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Caution is recommended when co-administering \nEurartesim with medicinal products exhibiting variable patterns of inhibition, induction or competition \nfor CYP3A4 as the therapeutic and/or toxic effects of some co-administered medicinal products could \nbe altered.  \n \nPiperaquine is also a substrate of CYP3A4. A moderate increase of piperaquine plasma concentrations \n(<2-fold) was observed when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in a potential \nexacerbation of the effect on QTc prolongation (see section 4.5).  \n \nExposure to piperaquine may also be increased when co-administered with mild or moderate \nCYP3A4-inhibitors (e.g. oral contraceptives). Therefore, caution should be applied when co-\nadministering Eurartesim with any CYP3A4-inhibitor and ECG monitoring should be considered. \n \nDue to the lack of multiple dose PK data for piperaquine, administration of any strong \nCYP3A4-inhibitors should be discouraged after initiation (i.e. the first dose) of Eurartesim (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nEurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other suitable \nand effective antimalarials are available (see section 4.6). \n \nIn the absence of carcinogenicity study data, and due to lack of clinical experience with repeated \ncourses of treatment in humans, no more than two courses of Eurartesim should be given in a \n12-month period (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \nEffects on cardiac repolarization \nIn clinical trials with Eurartesim limited ECGs were obtained during treatment. These showed that \nQTc prolongation occurred more frequently and to a larger extent in association with Eurartesim \ntherapy than with the comparators (see section 5.1 for details of the comparators). Analysis of cardiac \nadverse events in clinical trials showed that these were reported more frequently in Eurartesim treated \npatients than in those treated with comparator antimalarial (see section 4.8). Before the third dose of \nEurartesim, in one of the two Phase III studies 3/767 patients (0.4%) were reported to have a QTcF \nvalue of  >500 ms versus none in the comparator group. \n \nThe potential for Eurartesim to prolong the QTc interval was investigated in parallel groups of healthy \nvolunteers who took each dose with high (~1000 Kcal) or low (~400 Kcal) fat/calorie meals or in \nfasting conditions. Compared to placebo, the maximum mean increases in QTcF on Day 3 of dosing \nwith Eurartesim were 45.2, 35.5 and 21.0 msec under respective dosing conditions. The QTcF \nprolongation observed under fasting conditions lasted between 4 and 11 hours after the last dose was \nadministered on Day 3. The mean QTcF prolongation compared to placebo decreased to 11.8 msec at \n24 hours and to 7.5 msec at 48 hours. No healthy subject dosed in fasting conditions showed a QTcF \ngreater than 480 msec or an increase over baseline greater than 60 msec. The number of subjects with \nQTcF greater than 480 msec after dosing with low fat meals was 3/64, while 10/64 had QTcF values \nover this threshold after dosing with high fat meals. No subject had a QTcF value greater than \n500 msec in any of the dosing conditions. \n \nAn ECG should be obtained as early as possible during treatment with Eurartesim and ECG \nmonitoring should be applied in patients who may have a higher risk of developing arrhythmia in \nassociation with QTc prolongation (see below). \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, consideration should be given to obtaining an ECG from all patients \nbefore the last of the three daily doses is taken and approximately 4-6 hours after the last dose, since \nthe risk of QTc interval prolongation may be greatest during this period (see section 5.2).  QTc \nintervals of more than 500 ms are associated with a pronounced risk for potentially life-threatening \nventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, ECG monitoring during the following 24-48 hours should be \napplied for patients found to have a prolongation to this extent. These patients should not receive \nanother dose of Eurartesim and alternative antimalarial therapy should be instituted. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n6 \n\nCompared to adult males, female patients and elderly patients have longer QTc intervals. Therefore, \nthey may be more sensitive to the effects of QTc-prolonging medications such as Eurartesim so that \nspecial caution is required. \n \nDelayed Haemolytic Anaemia \nDelayed haemolytic anaemia has been observed up to one month following use of IV artesunate and \noral artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) including reports involving Eurartesim. Risk \nfactors may include young age (children under 5 years old) and previous treatment with IV artesunate. \n \nPatients and caregivers should be advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of post-treatment \nhaemolysis such as pallor, jaundice, dark-coloured urine, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness \nand confusion. \n \nPaediatric population \nSpecial precaution is advised in young children when vomiting, as they are likely to develop \nelectrolyte disturbances. These may increase the QTc-prolonging effect of Eurartesim (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \nEurartesim has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency \n(see section 4.2). Due to the potential for higher plasma concentrations of piperaquine to occur, \ncaution is advised if Eurartesim is administered to patients with jaundice and/or with moderate or \nsevere renal or hepatic insufficiency, and ECG and blood potassium monitoring are advised. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEurartesim is contraindicated in patients already taking other medicinal products that are known to \nprolong the QTc interval due to the risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction leading to an additive effect \non the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nA limited number of drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction studies with Eurartesim have been \nperformed in healthy adult subjects. Therefore the assessment of the potential for drug-drug \ninteractions to occur is based on either in vivo or in vitro studies. \n \nEffect of Eurartesim on co-administered medicinal products \nPiperaquine is metabolised by, and is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. The concurrent administration of oral \nEurartesim with 7.5 mg oral midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe substrate, led to a modest increase (≤2-fold) \nin midazolam and its metabolites exposures in healthy adult subjects. This inhibitory effect was no \nlonger evident one week after last administration of Eurartesim. Therefore, particular attention should \nbe paid when medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts and cyclosporine) are co-administered with Eurartesim.  \n \nFrom in vitro data, piperaquine undergoes a low level of metabolism by CYP2C19, and is also an \ninhibitor of this enzyme. There is the potential for reducing the rate of metabolism of other substrates \nof this enzyme, such as omeprazole, with consequent increase of their plasma concentration, and \ntherefore, of their toxicity. \n \nPiperaquine has the potential to increase the rate of metabolism for CYP2E1 substrates resulting in a \ndecrease in the plasma concentrations of substrates such as paracetamol or theophylline, and the \nanaesthetic gases enflurane, halothane and isoflurane. The main consequence of this interaction could \nbe a reduction of efficacy of the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nArtenimol administration may result in a slight decrease in CYP1A2 activity. Caution is therefore, \nadvised when Eurartesim is administered concomitantly with medicinal products metabolised by this \nenzyme that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline. Any effects are unlikely to persist \nbeyond 24 hours after the last intake of artenimol.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n7 \n\nEffect of co-administered medicinal products on Eurartesim  \nPiperaquine is metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. The concurrent administration of a single dose of oral \nclarithromycin, (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor probe) with a single dose of oral Eurartesim led to a \nmodest increase (≤2-fold) in piperaquine exposure in healthy adult subjects. This increase in exposure \nto the antimalarial combination may result in an exacerbation of the effect on QTc (see section 4.4). \nTherefore, particular caution is required if Eurartesim is administered to patients taking potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. some protease inhibitors [amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, \nritonavir], nefazodone or verapamil), and ECG monitoring should be considered due to the risk of \nhigher plasma concentrations of piperaquine (see section 4.4). \n \nEnzyme inducing medicinal products such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, \nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to lead to reduced piperaquine plasma \nconcentrations. The concentration of artenimol may also be reduced. Concomitant treatment with such \nmedicinal products is not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nDrug-drug interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The extent of interactions in the \npaediatric population is not known. The above mentioned interactions for adults and the warnings in \nsection 4.4 should be taken into account for the paediatric population. \n \nOral contraceptives \nWhen co-administered to healthy women, Eurartesim exerted only a minimum  effect on an \nestrogen/progestinic combination oral contraceptive treatment increasing the ethynilestradiol rate of \nabsorption (expressed by geometric mean Cmax) of about 28% but not significantly changing the \nexposure to ethynilestradiol and levonorgestrel and not influencing contraception activity as \ndemonstrated by the similar plasma concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing \nhormone (LH) and progesterone observed after oral contraceptive treatment with or without \nconcomitant Eurartesim administration. \n \nFood interaction \nAbsorption of piperaquine is increased in the presence of fatty food (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) which \nmay increase its effect on QTc interval. Therefore, Eurartesim should be taken with water only as \ndescribed in section 4.2. Eurartesim should not be taken with grapefruit juice as it is likely to lead to \nincreased piperaquine plasma concentrations. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are only limited (n=3) amount of data from the use of artenimol/piperaquine during the 1st \ntrimester of pregnancy. \n\nBased on animal data, Eurartesim is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \nthe first trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Reproductive studies with artemisinin \nderivatives have demonstrated teratogenic potential with an increased risk during early gestation (see \nsection 5.3). Piperaquine was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit.  \n\nTherefore Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other \nsuitable and effective anti-malarials are available (see section 4.4). \n\nA large amount of data (more than 3000 exposed outcomes) from the use of artenimol/piperaquine \nduring the 2nd and 3rd trimester indicate no fetotoxicity. In perinatal and postnatal studies in rats, \npiperaquine was associated with delivery complications. However, there was no delay in neonatal \ndevelopment following exposure in utero or via milk (see section 5.3). \n\nConsequently, if Eurartesim is more suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin-based \ncombination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim \nmay be used in the 2nd and 3 trimester. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nAnimal data suggest excretion of piperaquine into breast milk but no data are available in humans. \nWomen taking Eurartesim should not breast-feed during their treatment. \n \n \nFertility \nThere are no specific data relating to the effects of piperaquine on fertility, however, to date no \nadverse events have been reported during clinical use. Moreover, data obtained in animal studies show \nthat fertility is unaffected by artenimol in both females and males. \n \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse event data collected in clinical trials suggest that Eurartesim has no influence on the ability to \ndrive and operate machines once the patient has recovered from the acute infection. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of Eurartesim has been evaluated in two phase III open-label studies involving \n1,239 paediatric patients up to 18 years and 566 adult patients >18 years treated with Eurartesim. \n \nIn a randomised trial in which 767 adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were \nexposed to Eurartesim, 25% of subjects were judged to have experienced an adverse drug reaction \n(ADR). No single type of ADR occurred at an incidence of ≥5%. The most frequent ADRs observed at \nan incidence ≥1.0% were: Headache (3.9%), Electrocardiogram QTc Prolonged (3.4%), P. falciparum \ninfection (3.0%), Anaemia (2.8%), Eosinophilia (1.7%), Haemoglobin decreased (1.7%), Sinus \ntachycardia (1.7%), Asthenia (1.6%), Haematocrit [decreased] (1.6%), Pyrexia (1.5%), Red Blood \nCell Count decreased (1.4%). A total of 6 (0.8%) subjects had serious ADRs in the study. \n \nIn a second randomised trial, 1,038 children, aged between 6 months and 5 years, were exposed to \nEurartesim and 71% were judged to have experienced an ADR. The following ADRs were observed at \nan incidence of ≥5.0%: Cough (32%), Pyrexia (22.4%), Influenza (16.0%), P. falciparum infection \n(14.1%), Diarrhoea (9.4%), Vomiting (5.5%) and Anorexia (5.2%). A total of 15 (1.5%) subjects had \nserious ADRs in the study. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn the tables below, ADRs are listed under system organ class (SOC), and ranked by headings of \nfrequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness, using the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). The table in this section is for adult patients only. A \ncorresponding table for paediatric patients is presented in the specific section below.  \n \nFrequency of ADRs in adult patients participating in clinical studies with Eurartesim: \n \n\nSOC Very Common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \ninfestations  \n\nP. falciparum \ninfection \n\nRespiratory tract infection  \nInfluenza \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders  Anaemia  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition  \ndisorders \n\n  Anorexia \n\n\n\n \n \n\n9 \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  Headache \n\nConvulsion \nDizziness \n\nCardiac disorders  QTc prolonged Tachycardia \n\nCardiac conduction disorders \nSinus arrhythmias \nBradycardia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic  \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Cough \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders   \n\nVomiting  \nDiarrhoea \nNausea \nAbdominal pain \n\nHepatobiliary disorders   \nHepatitis  \nHepatomegaly  \nAbnormal liver function tests  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \nTissue disorders   Pruritis \n\nMusculoskeletal and  \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Arthralgia Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site  \nconditions \n\n Asthenia  Pyrexia  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nThe ADRs noted for Eurartesim were generally mild in severity, and the majority were non-serious. \nReactions such as cough, pyrexia, headache, P. falciparum infection, anaemia, asthenia, anorexia and \nthe observed changes in blood cell parameters are consistent with those expected in patients with acute \nmalaria. The effect on prolongation of the QTc interval was observed on Day 2, and had resolved by \nDay 7 (the next time point at which ECGs were performed). \n \nPaediatric population \nA tabular overview of the frequency of the ADRs in paediatric patients is given below.  The majority \nof paediatric experience is derived from African children aged 6 months to 5 years. \n \nFrequency of ADRs in paediatric patients participating in clinical studies with Eurartesim: \n \n\nSOC Very Common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfluenza  \nP. falciparum \ninfection \n\nRespiratory tract \ninfection  \nEar infection \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n system disorders  \n\nThrombocytopenia \nLeukopenia/neutrope\nnia \nLeuckocytoses NEC \nAnaemia \n\n \nThrombocythaemia \nSplenomegaly \nLymphadenopathy \nHypochromasia \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition  \ndisorders \n\n Anorexia  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders   \n\nConvulsion \nHeadache \n\nEye disorders  Conjunctivitis  \n\nCardiac disorders  QT/QTc prolonged Heart rate irregular \n\nCardiac conduction \ndisorders \nCardiac murmur \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10 \n\nSOC Very Common Common Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic  \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough  Rhinorrhoea Epistaxis \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nVomiting  \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain \n\n \nStomatitis \nNausea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders   \n\nHepatitis  \nHepatomegaly \nAbnormal liver function \ntests \nJaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \nTissue disorders  \n\nDermatitis  \nRash \n\nAcanthosis \nPruritis \n\nMusculoskeletal and  \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Arthralgia \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site  \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Asthenia  \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials, nine patients received double the cumulative intended dose of Eurartesim. The safety \nprofile of these patients did not differ from that of patients receiving the recommended dose, with no \npatient reporting SAEs. \n \nIn cases of suspected overdose, symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate, \nincluding ECG monitoring because of the possibility of QTc interval prolongation (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiprotozoals, antimalarials, artemisinin and derivatives, combinations, \nATC code: P01BF05 \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nArtenimol is able to reach high concentrations within the parasitized erythrocytes. Its endoperoxide \nbridge is thought to be essential for its antimalarial activity, causing free-radical damage to parasite \nmembrane systems including:  \n• Inhibition of falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, \n• Interference with mitochondrial electron transport \n• Interference with parasite transport proteins \n• Disruption of parasite mitochondrial function \n \nThe exact mechanism of action of piperaquine is unknown, but it likely mirrors that of chloroquine, a \nclose structural analogue. Chloroquine binds to toxic haeme (derived from the patient’s haemoglobin) \nwithin the malaria parasite, preventing its detoxification via a polymerisation step.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=P01\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=P01B\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=P01BF\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n\n \nPiperaquine is a bisquinoline, and this class has shown good antimalarial activity against chloroquine-\nresistant Plasmodium strains in vitro. The bulky bisquinolone structure may be important for activity \nagainst chloroquine-resistant strains, and may act through the following mechanisms: \n• Inhibition of the transporters that efflux chloroquine from the parasite food vacuole  \n• Inhibition of haem-digestion pathway in the parasite food vacuole. \n\n \nResistance to piperaquine (when used as monotherapy) has been reported.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Eurartesim have been assessed in two large randomised, open-label clinical \ntrials: \n \nStudy DM040010 was conducted in Asian adult and paediatric patients with uncomplicated \nP. falciparum malaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artesunate + Mefloquine (AS + MQ). \nThe primary end-point was the PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 63. \n \nStudy DM040011 was conducted in African paediatric patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum \nmalaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artemether + Lumefantrine (A + L). The primary \nend-point was PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 28. \n \nThe results for the primary endpoint in the modified intent to treat (m-ITT) populations (defined as all \nrandomised patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment, with the exclusion of those \npatients lost to follow up for unknown reasons) were as follows: \n \n\nStudy \n\nPCR-corrected cure rate (m-ITT) \n\nEurartesim AS + MQ A + L \n\n95 % two-sided CI on \nthe treatment difference \n\n(Eurartesim - \nComparator); p-value \n\nDM040010 (n=1087) 97.0% 95.3% - (-0.84, 4.19) %; p=0.161 \nDM040011 (n=1524) 92.7% - 94.8% (-4.59, 0.45) %; p=0.128 \n\n \nIn each case the results confirmed that Eurartesim was not inferior to the comparator medicinal \nproduct. In both studies, the true treatment failure rate was below the 5% efficacy threshold set by \nWHO. \n \nThe age-specific PCR-corrected cure rates in the m-ITT populations are tabulated below for the Asian \nand African studies, respectively: \n \n\nStudy \n\nPCR-corrected cure rate (m-ITT) \n\nEurartesim AS + MQ A + L \n\n95% two-sided CI on the \ntreatment difference \n\n(Eurartesim - Comparator); \np-value \n\nDM04010 (n=1087) \n≤5 years \n>5 to ≤12 years \n>12 to ≤18 years \n>18 to ≤64 years \n\n \n100.0% \n98.2% \n97.3% \n96.6% \n\n \n100.0% \n96.5% \n\n100.0% \n94.4% \n\n \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n \n- \n\n(-3.67, 7.09)%; 0.605 \n(-6.40, 0.99)%; 1.000 \n(-0.98, 5.30)%; 0.146 \n\nDM04011 (n=1524) \n≤1 year \n>1 to ≤2 years \n>2 to ≤5 years \n\n \n91.5% \n92.6% \n93.0% \n\n \n- \n- \n- \n\n \n98.5% \n94.6% \n94.0% \n\n \n(-12.66, -1.32)%(1); 0.064 \n\n(-6.76, 2.63)%; 0.413 \n(-4.41, 2.47)%; 0.590 \n\n(1) This CI is asymptotic because the exact CI could not be computed \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12 \n\nIn the European Safety Registry 25 patients weighing ≥ 100 kg (range 100 -121 kg) were treated with 4 \ntablets 320/40 mg PQP/artenimol for 3 days. Twenty-two of these patients were shown to be parasitic \nfree at the last microscopic analysis of the blood sample; three patients did not complete parasitological \nblood analysis. All patients were clinically cured. \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic profiles of artenimol and piperaquine have been investigated in animal models and in \ndifferent human populations (healthy volunteers, adult patients and paediatric patients). \n \nAbsorption \nArtenimol is very rapidly absorbed, Tmax being approximately 1-2 hrs after single and multiple dosing. \nIn patients, mean Cmax (CV %) and AUCINF of artenimol (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) \nwere 752 (47%) ng/ml and 2,002 (45%) ng/ml*h, respectively. \n \nArtenimol bioavailability appears to be higher in malaria patients than in healthy volunteers, possibly \nbecause malaria per se has an effect on artenimol disposition. This may reflect malaria-associated \nimpairment of hepatic function, causing an increase in artenimol bioavailability (reduction of first \nhepatic effect) without affecting its apparent elimination half-life, which is absorption rate limited. In \nhealthy male volunteers under fasting conditions, mean Cmax and AUCINF of artenimol ranged between \n180-252 ng/ml and 516-684 ng/ml*h, respectively. \n \nThe systemic exposure to artenimol was slightly lower following the last dose of Eurartesim (lower \nthan after the first dose by up to 15%). Artenimol pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be \nsimilar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. artenimol systemic exposure on the last \nday of treatment was higher in females than in males, the difference being within 30%. \n \nIn healthy volunteers, artenimol exposure was increased by 43% when administered with a high \nfat/high calorie meal.  \n \nPiperaquine, a highly lipophilic compound, is slowly absorbed. In humans, piperaquine has a Tmax of \napproximately 5 hours following a single and repeated dose. In patients mean (CV %) Cmax and  \nAUC0-24 (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) were 179 (62%) ng/ml and 1,679 (47%) ng/ml*h, \nrespectively. Due to its slow elimination, piperaquine accumulates in plasma after multiple doses with \nan accumulation factor of approximately 3. Piperaquine pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be \nsimilar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. On the other hand, on the last day of \nEurtartesim treatment, the piperaquine maximum plasma concentration was higher in female than in \nmale healthy volunteers, the difference being in the order of 30 to 50%. \n \nIn healthy volunteers, piperaquine exposure is increased approximately 3-fold when administered with \na high fat/high calorie meal. This pharmacokinetic effect is accompanied by an increased effect on \nprolongation of the QT interval. Accordingly, Eurartesim should be administered with water no less \nthan 3 hours after the last food intake, and no food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose  \n(see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nBoth piperaquine and artenimol are highly bound to human plasma proteins: the protein binding \nobserved in in vitro studies was 44-93% for artenimol and >99% for piperaquine. Moreover, from in \nvitro and in vivo data in animals, piperaquine and artenimol tend to accumulate in RBC. \n \nArtenimolwas observed to have a small volume of distribution in humans (0.8 l/kg; CV 35.5%).  \nPharmacokinetic parameters observed for piperaquine in humans indicate that this active substance has \na large volume of distribution (730 l/kg; CV 37.5%). \n \nBiotransformation \n\n\n\n \n \n\n13 \n\nArtenimol is principally converted to α-artenimol-β-glucuronide (α-artenimol-G). Studies in human \nliver microsomes showed that artenimol was metabolised by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT1A9 and UGT2B7) to α-artenimol-G with no cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. In vitro \ndrug-drug interaction studies revealed that artenimol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2; therefore, there is the \npotential for artenimol to increase plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (see section 4.5). \n \nIn vitro metabolism studies demonstrated that piperaquine is metabolised by human hepatocytes \n(approximately 85% of piperaquine remained after 2 hours incubation at 37°C). Piperaquine was \nmainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Piperaquine was \nfound to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (also in a time-dependent way) and to a lesser extent of \nCYP2C19, while it stimulated the activity of CYP2E1.  \n \nNo effect on the metabolite profile of piperaquine in human hepatocytes was observed when \npiperaquine was co-incubated with artenimol. The piperaquine major metabolites were a carboxyl \nacid cleavage product, and a mono-N-oxidated product. \nIn human studies, piperaquine was found to be a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzyme while potent \ninhibitors of CYP3A4 activity caused mild inhibition of piperaquine metabolism (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life of artenimol is approximately 1 hour. The mean oral clearance for adult \npatients with malaria was 1.34 l/h/kg. The mean oral clearance was slightly higher for paediatric \npatients, however the differences were minor in magnitude (<20%). Artenimol is eliminated by \nmetabolism (mainly glucuroconjugation). Its clearance was found to be slightly lower in female than \nin male healthy volunteers. Data regarding artenimol excretion in humans are scarce. However, it is \nreported in the literature that the excretion of unchanged active substance in human urine and faeces is \nnegligible for artemisinin derivatives. \n \nThe elimination half-life of piperaquine is around 22 days for adult patients and around 20 days for \npaediatric patients. The mean oral clearance for adult patients with malaria was 2.09 l/h/kg, while in \npaediatric patients was 2.43 l/h/kg. Due to its long elimination half-life, piperaquine accumulates after \nmultiple dosing. \n \nAnimal studies showed that radiolabelled piperaquine is excreted by the biliary route, while urinary \nexcretion is negligible. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \nNo specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with hepatic or renal \ninsufficiency, or in elderly people. \n \nIn a paediatric pharmacokinetic study, and based on very limited sampling, minor differences were \nobserved for artenimol pharmacokinetics between the paediatric and adult populations. The mean \nclearance (1.45 l/h/kg) was slightly faster in the paediatric patients than in the adult patients \n(1.34 l/h/kg), while the mean volume of distribution in the paediatric patients (0.705 l/kg) was lower \nthan in the adults (0.801 l/kg). \nThe same comparison showed that piperaquine absorption rate constant and terminal half-life in \nchildren were predominantly similar to those seen in adults. However, the apparent clearance was \nfaster (1.30 versus 1.14 l/h/kg) and the apparent total volume of distribution was lower in the \npaediatric population (623 versus 730 l/kg). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGeneral toxicity \nLiterature data concerning chronic toxicity of piperaquine in dogs and monkeys indicate some \nhepatotoxicity and mild reversible depression of total white cell and neutrophil counts. \n \nThe most important nonclinical safety findings after repeated dosing were the infiltration of \nmacrophages with intracytoplasmic basophilic granular material consistent with phospholipidosis and \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n\ndegenerative lesions in numerous organs and tissues. These adverse reactions were seen in animals at \nexposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels, and with possible relevance to clinical use. It is not \nknown whether these toxic effects are reversible. \n \nArtenimol and piperaquine were not genotoxic/clastogenic based on in vitro and in vivo testing. \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed. \n \nArtenimol causes embryolethality and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  \n \nPiperaquine did not induce malformation in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal and postnatal development \nstudy (segment III) in female rats treated with 80 mg/kg, some animals had a delay of delivery \ninducing mortality of the neonates. In females delivering normally the development, behaviour and \ngrowth of the surviving progeny was normal following exposure in utero or via milk. \n \nNo reproduction toxicity studies have been performed with the combination of artenimol and \npiperaquine. \n \nCentral nervous system (CNS) toxicity \nThere is potential for neurotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives in man and animals, which is strongly \nrelated to the dose, route and formulations of the different artenimol pro-drugs. In humans, the \npotential neurotoxicity of orally administered artenimol can be considered highly unlikely, given the \nrapid clearance ofartenimol, and its short exposure (3 days of treatment for malaria patients). There \nwas no evidence of artenimol-induced lesions in the specific nuclei in rats or dogs, even at lethal dose. \n \nCardiovascular toxicity \nEffects on blood pressure and on PR and QRS duration were observed at high piperaquine doses. The \nmost important potential cardiac effect was related to cardiac conduction. \n \nIn the hERG test, the IC50 was 0.15 µmol for piperaquine and 7.7 µmol forartenimol. The association \nof artenimol and piperaquine does not produce hERG inhibition greater than that of the single \ncompounds. \n \nPhototoxicity  \nThere are no phototoxicity concerns with artenimol, as it does not absorb in the range of 290-700 nm.  \nPiperaquine has an absorption maximum at 352 nm. Since piperaquine is present in the skin (about 9% \nin the non-pigmented rat and only 3% in the pigmented rat), slight phototoxic reactions (swelling and \nerythema) were observed 24 hours after oral treatment in mice exposed to UV radiation.  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEurartesim is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults, \nadolescents, children and infants 6 months and over and weighing 5 kg or more. \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial medicinal \nproducts. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nEurartesim should be administered over three consecutive days for a total of three doses taken at the \nsame time each day.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n17 \n\nDosing should be based on body weight as shown in the table below. \n \n\nBody weight \n(kg) \n\nDaily dose (mg) \nTablet strength and number of tablets per dose \n\nPQP Artenimol \n\n5 to <7 80 10 ½ x 160 mg / 20 mg tablet \n\n7 to <13 160 20 1 x 160 mg / 20 mg tablet \n\n13 to <24 320 40 1 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablet \n\n24 to <36 640 80 2 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets \n\n36 to <75 960 120 3 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets \n\n> 75*  1,280 160 4 x 320 mg / 40 mg tablets \n\n  \n* see section 5.1 \n \nIf a patient vomits within 30 minutes of taking Eurartesim, the whole dose should be re-administered; \nif a patient vomits within 30-60 minutes, half the dose should be re-administered. Re-dosing with \nEurartesim should not be attempted more than once. If the second dose is vomited, alternative \nantimalarial therapy should be instituted. \n \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as realised and then the recommended regimen \ncontinued until the full course of treatment has been completed. \n \nThere is no data on a second course of treatment. \nNo more than two courses of Eurartesim may be given within a 12 month period (see sections 4.4 and \n5.3). \nA second course of Eurartesim should not be given within 2 months after the first course due to the \nlong elimination half-life of piperaquine (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nClinical studies of Eurartesim did not include patients aged 65 years and over, therefore no dosing \nrecommendation can be made. Considering the possibility of age-associated decrease in hepatic and \nrenal function, as well as a potential for heart disorders (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), caution should be \nexercised when administering the product to the elderly. \n \n \nHepatic and renal impairment  \nEurartesim has not been evaluated in subjects with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency. \nTherefore, caution is advised when administering Eurartesim to these patients (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Eurartesim in infants aged less than 6 months and in children weighing less \nthan 5 kg has not been established. No data are available for these paediatric subsets. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEurartesim should be taken orally with water and without food. \nEach dose should be taken no less than 3 hours after the last food intake. \nNo food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18 \n\nFor patients unable to swallow the tablets, such as infants and young children, Eurartesim may be \ncrushed and mixed with water. The mixture should be used immediately after preparation. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n- Severe malaria according to WHO definition. \n \n- Family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval. \n \n- Known congenital prolongation of the QTc-interval or any clinical condition known to prolong \n\nthe QTc interval. \n \n- History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia. \n \n- Any predisposing cardiac conditions for arrhythmia such as severe hypertension, left ventricular \n\nhypertrophy (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or congestive cardiac failure \naccompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. \n\n \n- Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia. \n \n- Taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval. These include (but are \n\nnot limited to): \n \n\n• Antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, \nquinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). \n\n \n• Neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, \n\nmesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine), antidepressive medicinal products. \n \n• Certain antimicrobialmedicinal products, including medicinal products of the following \n\nclasses:  \n− macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin), \n− fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin),  \n− imidazole and triazole antifungal medicinal products, \n− and also pentamidine and saquinavir. \n\n \n• Certain non-sedating antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine).  \n \n• Cisapride, droperidol, domperidone, bepridil, diphemanil, probucol, levomethadyl, \n\nmethadone, vinca alkaloids, arsenic trioxide.  \n \n\n- Recent treatment with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval that may still be \ncirculating at the time that Eurartesim is commenced (e.g. mefloquine, halofantrine, \nlumefantrine, chloroquine, quinine and other antimalarial medicinal products) taking into \naccount their elimination half-life. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEurartesim should not be used to treat severe falciparum malaria (see section 4.3) and, due to \ninsufficient data, should not be used to treat malaria due to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae \nor Plasmodium ovale. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n19 \n\nThe long half-life of piperaquine (about 22 days) should be kept in mind in the event that another anti-\nmalarial agent is started due to treatment failure or a new malaria infection (see below and sections 4.3 \nand 4.5). \n \nPiperaquine is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Caution is recommended when co-administering \nEurartesim with medicinal products exhibiting variable patterns of inhibition, induction or competition \nfor CYP3A4 as the therapeutic and/or toxic effects of some co-administered medicinal products could \nbe altered.  \n \nPiperaquine is also a substrate of CYP3A4. A moderate increase of piperaquine plasma concentrations \n(<2-fold) was observed when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in a potential \nexacerbation of the effect on QTc prolongation (see section 4.5).  \n \nExposure to piperaquine may also be increased when co-administered with mild or moderate \nCYP3A4-inhibitors (e.g. oral contraceptives). Therefore, caution should be applied when \nco-administering Eurartesim with any CYP3A4-inhibitor and ECG monitoring should be considered. \n \nDue to the lack of multiple dose PK data for piperaquine, administration of any strong \nCYP3A4-inhibitors should be discouraged after initiation (i.e. the first dose) of Eurartesim (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nEurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other suitable \nand effective antimalarials are available (see section 4.6). \n \nIn the absence of carcinogenicity study data, and due to lack of clinical experience with repeated \ncourses of treatment in humans, no more than two courses of Eurartesim should be given in a \n12-month period (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \nEffects on cardiac repolarization \nIn clinical trials with Eurartesim limited ECGs were obtained during treatment. These showed that \nQTc prolongation occurred more frequently and to a larger extent in association with Eurartesim \ntherapy than with the comparators (see section 5.1 for details of the comparators). Analysis of cardiac \nadverse events in clinical trials showed that these were reported more frequently in Eurartesim treated \npatients than in those treated with comparator antimalarial (see section 4.8). Before the third dose of \nEurartesim, in one of the two Phase III studies 3/767 patients (0.4%) were reported to have a QTcF \nvalue of >500 ms versus none in the comparator group. \n \nThe potential for Eurartesim to prolong the QTc interval was investigated in parallel groups of healthy \nvolunteers who took each dose with high (~1000 Kcal) or low (~400 Kcal) fat/calorie meals or in \nfasting conditions. Compared to placebo, the maximum mean increases in QTcF on Day 3 of dosing \nwith Eurartesim were 45.2, 35.5 and 21.0 msec under respective dosing conditions. The QTcF \nprolongation observed under fasting conditions lasted between 4 and 11 hours after the last dose was \nadministered on Day 3. The mean QTcF prolongation compared to placebo decreased to 11.8 msec at \n24 hours and to 7.5 msec at 48 hours. No healthy subject dosed in fasting conditions showed a QTcF \ngreater than 480 msec or an increase over baseline greater than 60 msec. The number of subjects with \nQTcF greater than 480 msec after dosing with low fat meals was 3/64, while 10/64 had QTcF values \nover this threshold after dosing with high fat meals. No subject had a QTcF value greater than \n500 msec in any of the dosing conditions. \n \nAn ECG should be obtained as early as possible during treatment with Eurartesim and ECG \nmonitoring should be applied in patients who may have a higher risk of developing arrhythmia in \nassociation with QTc prolongation (see below).  \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, consideration should be given to obtaining an ECG from all patients \nbefore the last of the three daily doses is taken and approximately 4-6 hours after the last dose, since \nthe risk of QTc interval prolongation may be greatest during this period (see section 5.2).  QTc \nintervals of more than 500 ms are associated with a pronounced risk for potentially life-threatening \n\n\n\n \n \n\n20 \n\nventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, ECG monitoring during the following 24-48 hours should be \napplied for patients found to have a prolongation to this extent. These patients should not receive \nanother dose of Eurartesim and alternative antimalarial therapy should be instituted.  \n \nCompared to adult males, female patients and elderly patients have longer QTc intervals. Therefore, \nthey may be more sensitive to the effects of QTc-prolonging medications such as Eurartesim so that \nspecial caution is required. \n \nDelayed Haemolytic Anaemia \nDelayed haemolytic anaemia has been observed up to one month following use of IV artesunate and \noral artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) including reports involving Eurartesim. Risk \nfactors may include young age (children under 5 years old) and previous treatment with IV artesunate. \n \nPatients and caregivers should be advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of post-treatment \nhaemolysis such as pallor, jaundice, dark-coloured urine, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness \nand confusion. \n \nPaediatric population \nSpecial precaution is advised in young children when vomiting, as they are likely to develop \nelectrolyte disturbances. These may increase the QTc-prolonging effect of Eurartesim (see section \n4.3). \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \nEurartesim has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe renal or hepatic insufficiency \n(see section 4.2). Due to the potential for higher plasma concentrations of piperaquine to occur, \ncaution is advised if Eurartesim is administered to patients with jaundice and/or with moderate or \nsevere renal or hepatic insufficiency, and ECG and blood potassium monitoring are advised. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEurartesim is contraindicated in patients already taking other medicinal products that are known to \nprolong the QTc interval due to the risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction leading to an additive effect \non the QTc interval (see section 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nA limited number of drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction studies with Eurartesim have been \nperformed in healthy adult subjects. Therefore the assessment of the potential for drug-drug \ninteractions to occur is based on either in vivo or in vitro studies. \n \nEffect of Eurartesim on co-administered medicinal products \nPiperaquine is metabolised by, and is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. The concurrent administration of oral \nEurartesim with 7.5 mg oral midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe substrate, led to a modest increase (≤2-fold) \nin midazolam and its metabolites exposures in healthy adult subjects. This inhibitory effect was no \nlonger evident one week after last administration of Eurartesim. Therefore, particular attention should \nbe paid when medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts and cyclosporine) are co-administered with Eurartesim.  \n \nFrom in vitro data, piperaquine undergoes a low level of metabolism by CYP2C19, and is also an \ninhibitor of this enzyme. There is the potential for reducing the rate of metabolism of other substrates \nof this enzyme, such as omeprazole, with consequent increase of their plasma concentration, and \ntherefore, of their toxicity. \n \nPiperaquine has the potential to increase the rate of metabolism for CYP2E1 substrates resulting in a \ndecrease in the plasma concentrations of substrates such as paracetamol or theophylline, and the \nanaesthetic gases enflurane, halothane and isoflurane. The main consequence of this interaction could \nbe a reduction of efficacy of the co-administered medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n21 \n\nArtenimol administration may result in a slight decrease in CYP1A2 activity. Caution is therefore, \nadvised when Eurartesim is administered concomitantly with medicinal products metabolised by this \nenzyme that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline. Any effects are unlikely to persist \nbeyond 24 hours after the last intake of artenimol. \n \nEffect of co-administered medicinal products on Eurartesim  \nPiperaquine is metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. The concurrent administration of a single dose of oral \nclarithromycin, (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor probe) with a single dose of oral Eurartesim led to a \nmodest increase (≤2-fold) in piperaquine exposure in healthy adult subjects. This increase in exposure \nto the antimalarial combination may result in an exacerbation of the effect on QTc (see section 4.4). \nTherefore, particular caution is required if Eurartesim is administered to patients taking potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. some protease inhibitors [amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, \nritonavir], nefazodone or verapamil), and ECG monitoring should be considered due to the risk of \nhigher plasma concentrations of piperaquine (see section 4.4).  \n \n \nEnzyme inducing medicinal products such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, \nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to lead to reduced piperaquine plasma \nconcentrations. The concentration of artenimol may also be reduced. Concomitant treatment with such \nmedicinal products is not recommended.  \n \nPaediatric population \nDrug-drug interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The extent of interactions in the \npaediatric population is not known. The above mentioned interactions for adults and the warnings in \nsection 4.4 should be taken into account for the paediatric population. \n \nOral contraceptives \nWhen co-administered to healthy women, Eurartesim exerted only a minimum effect on an \nestrogen/progestinic combination oral contraceptive treatment increasing the ethynilestradiol rate of \nabsorption (expressed by geometric mean Cmax) of about 28% but not significantly changing the \nexposure to ethynilestradiol and levonorgestrel and not influencing contraception activity as \ndemonstrated by the similar plasma concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing \nhormone (LH) and progesterone observed after oral contraceptive treatment with or without concomitant \nEurartesim administration. \n \nFood interaction \nAbsorption of piperaquine is increased in the presence of fatty food (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) which \nmay increase its effect on QTc interval. Therefore, Eurartesim should be taken with water only as \ndescribed in section 4.2. Eurartesim should not be taken with grapefruit juice as it is likely to lead to \nincreased piperaquine plasma concentrations. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are only limited (n=3) amount of data from the use of artenimol/piperaquine during the 1st \ntrimester of pregnancy. \n\nBased on animal data, Eurartesim is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \nthe first trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Reproductive studies with artemisinin \nderivatives have demonstrated teratogenic potential with an increased risk during early gestation (see \nsection 5.3). Piperaquine was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit.  \n\nTherefore Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other \nsuitable and effective anti-malarials are available (see section 4.4). \n\nA large amount of data (more than 3000 exposed outcomes) from the use of artenimol/piperaquine \nduring the 2nd and 3rd trimester indicate no fetotoxicity. In perinatal and postnatal studies in rats, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n22 \n\npiperaquine was associated with delivery complications. However, there was no delay in neonatal \ndevelopment following exposure in utero or via milk (see section 5.3). \n\nConsequently, if Eurartesim is more suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin-based \ncombination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim \nmay be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nAnimal data suggest excretion of piperaquine into breast milk but no data are available in humans. \nWomen taking Eurartesim should not breast-feed during their treatment. \n \nFertility \nThere are no specific data relating to the effects of piperaquine on fertility, however, to date no \nadverse events have been reported during clinical use. Moreover, data obtained in animal studies show \nthat fertility is unaffected by artenimol in both females and males. \n \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse event data collected in clinical trials suggest that Eurartesim has no influence on the ability to \ndrive and operate machines once the patient has recovered from the acute infection. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of Eurartesim has been evaluated in two phase III open-label studies involving \n1,239 paediatric patients up to 18 years and 566 adult patients >18 years treated with Eurartesim. \n \nIn a randomised trial in which 767 adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were \nexposed to Eurartesim, 25% of subjects were judged to have experienced an adverse drug reaction \n(ADR). No single type of ADR occurred at an incidence of ≥5%. The most frequent ADRs observed at \nan incidence ≥1.0% were: Headache (3.9%), Electrocardiogram QTc Prolonged (3.4%), P.  falciparum \ninfection (3.0%), Anaemia (2.8%), Eosinophilia (1.7%), Haemoglobin decreased (1.7%), Sinus \ntachycardia (1.7%), Asthenia (1.6%), Haematocrit [decreased] (1.6%), Pyrexia (1.5%), Red Blood \nCell Count decreased (1.4%). A total of 6 (0.8%) subjects had serious ADRs in the study. \n \nIn a second randomised trial, 1,038 children, aged between 6 months and 5 years, were exposed to \nEurartesim and 71% were judged to have experienced an ADR. The following ADRs were observed at \nan incidence of ≥5.0%: Cough (32%), Pyrexia (22.4%), Influenza (16.0%), P. falciparum infection \n(14.1%), Diarrhoea (9.4%), Vomiting (5.5%) and Anorexia (5.2%). A total of 15 (1.5%) subjects had \nserious ADRs in the study. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn the tables below, ADRs are listed under system organ class (SOC), and ranked by headings of \nfrequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness, using the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). The table in this section is for adult patients only. A \ncorresponding table for paediatric patients is presented in the specific section below.  \n \nFrequency of ADRs in adult patients participating in clinical studies with Eurartesim: \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n23 \n\nSOC Very Common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \ninfestations  \n\nP. falciparum \ninfection \n\nRespiratory tract infection  \nInfluenza \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders  Anaemia  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition  \ndisorders \n\n  Anorexia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  Headache \n\nConvulsion \nDizziness \n\nCardiac disorders  QTc prolonged Tachycardia \n\nCardiac conduction disorders \nSinus arrhythmias \nBradycardia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic  \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Cough \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders   \n\nVomiting  \nDiarrhoea \nNausea \nAbdominal pain \n\nHepatobiliary disorders   \nHepatitis  \nHepatomegaly  \nAbnormal liver function tests  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \nTissue disorders   Pruritis \n\nMusculoskeletal and  \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Arthralgia Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site  \nconditions \n\n Asthenia  Pyrexia  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nThe ADRs noted for Eurartesim were generally mild in severity, and the majority were non-serious. \nReactions such as cough, pyrexia, headache, P. falciparum infection, anaemia, asthenia, anorexia and \nthe observed changes in blood cell parameters are consistent with those expected in patients with acute \nmalaria. The effect on prolongation of the QTc interval was observed on Day 2, and had resolved by \nDay 7 (the next time point at which ECGs were performed).  \n \nPaediatric population \nA tabular overview of the frequency of the ADRs in paediatric patients is given below.  The majority \nof paediatric experience is derived from African children aged 6 months to 5 years. \n \nFrequency of ADRs in paediatric patients participating in clinical studies with Eurartesim: \n \n\nSOC Very Common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfluenza  \nP. falciparum \ninfection \n\nRespiratory tract \ninfection  \nEar infection \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n system disorders  \n\nThrombocytopenia \nLeukopenia/neutrope\nnia \nLeuckocytoses NEC \nAnaemia \n\n \nThrombocythaemia \nSplenomegaly \nLymphadenopathy \nHypochromasia \n\n\n\n \n \n\n24 \n\nSOC Very Common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition  \ndisorders \n\n Anorexia  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders   \n\nConvulsion \nHeadache \n\nEye disorders  Conjunctivitis  \n\nCardiac disorders  QT/QTc prolonged Heart rate irregular \n\nCardiac conduction \ndisorders \nCardiac murmur \n\nRespiratory, thoracic  \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough  Rhinorrhoea Epistaxis \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nVomiting  \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain \n\n \nStomatitis \nNausea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders   \n\nHepatitis  \nHepatomegaly \nAbnormal liver function \ntests \nJaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \nTissue disorders  \n\nDermatitis  \nRash \n\nAcanthosis \nPruritis \n\nMusculoskeletal and  \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Arthralgia \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site  \nconditions \n\nPyrexia Asthenia  \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials, nine patients received double the cumulative intended dose of Eurartesim. The safety \nprofile of these patients did not differ from that of patients receiving the recommended dose, with no \npatient reporting SAEs.  \n \nIn cases of suspected overdose, symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate, \nincluding ECG monitoring because of the possibility of QTc interval prolongation (see section 4.4) \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiprotozoals, antimalarials, Artemisinin and derivatives, combinations, \nATC code: P01BF05. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=P01\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=P01B\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=P01BF\n\n\n \n \n\n25 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nArtenimol is able to reach high concentrations within the parasitized erythrocytes. Its endoperoxide \nbridge is thought to be essential for its antimalarial activity, causing free-radical damage to parasite \nmembrane systems including:  \n• Inhibition of falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, \n• Interference with mitochondrial electron transport \n• Interference with parasite transport proteins \n• Disruption of parasite mitochondrial function \n \nThe exact mechanism of action of piperaquine is unknown, but it likely mirrors that of chloroquine, a \nclose structural analogue. Chloroquine binds to toxic haeme (derived from the patient’s haemoglobin) \nwithin the malaria parasite, preventing its detoxification via a polymerisation step.  \n \nPiperaquine is a bisquinoline, and this class has shown good antimalarial activity against chloroquine-\nresistant Plasmodium strains in vitro. The bulky bisquinolone structure may be important for activity \nagainst chloroquine- resistant strains, and may act through the following mechanisms: \n• Inhibition of the transporters that efflux chloroquine from the parasite food vacuole  \n• Inhibition of haem-digestion pathway in the parasite food vacuole. \n\n \nResistance to piperaquine (when used as monotherapy) has been reported.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Eurartesim have been assessed in two large randomised, open-label clinical \ntrials: \n \nStudy DM040010 was conducted in Asian adult and paediatric patients with uncomplicated \nP. falciparum malaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artesunate + Mefloquine (AS + MQ). \nThe primary end-point was the PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 63. \n \nStudy DM040011 was conducted in African paediatric patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum \nmalaria. Eurartesim treatment was compared with Artemether + Lumefantrine (A + L). The primary \nend-point was PCR-corrected cure rate at Day 28. \n \nThe results for the primary endpoint in the modified intent to treat (m-ITT) populations (defined as all \nrandomised patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment, with the exclusion of those \npatients lost to follow up for unknown reasons) were as follows: \n \n\nStudy \n\nPCR-corrected cure rate (m-ITT) \n\nEurartesim AS + MQ A + L \n\n95 % two-sided CI on \nthe treatment difference \n\n(Eurartesim - \nComparator); p-value \n\nDM040010 (n=1087) 97.0% 95.3% - (-0.84, 4.19)%; p=0.161 \nDM040011 (n=1524) 92.7% - 94.8% (-4.59, 0.45)%; p=0.128 \n\n \nIn each case the results confirmed that Eurartesim was not inferior to the comparator medicinal \nproduct. In both studies, the true treatment failure rate was below the 5% efficacy threshold set by \nWHO. \n \nThe age-specific PCR-corrected cure rates in the m-ITT populations are tabulated below for the Asian \nand African studies, respectively:  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n26 \n\nStudy \n\nPCR-corrected cure rate (m-ITT) \n\nEurartesim AS + MQ A + L \n\n95% two-sided CI on the \ntreatment difference \n\n(Eurartesim - Comparator); \np-value \n\nDM04010 (n=1087) \n≤5years \n>5 to ≤12years \n>12 to ≤18 years \n>18 to ≤64 years \n\n \n100.0% \n98.2% \n97.3% \n96.6% \n\n \n100.0% \n96.5% \n\n100.0% \n94.4% \n\n \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n \n- \n\n(-3.67, 7.09)%; 0.605 \n(-6.40, 0.99)%; 1.000 \n(-0.98, 5.30)%; 0.146 \n\nDM04011 (n=1524) \n≤1 year \n>1 to ≤ 2 years \n>2 to ≤5 years \n\n \n91.5% \n92.6% \n93.0% \n\n \n- \n- \n- \n\n \n98.5% \n94.6% \n94.0% \n\n \n(-12.66, -1.32)%(1); 0.064 \n\n(-6.76, 2.63)%; 0.413 \n(-4.41, 2.47)%; 0.590 \n\n(1) This CI is asymptotic because the exact CI could not be computed \n \nIn the European Safety Registry 25 patients weighing ≥ 100 kg (range 100 -121 kg) were treated with 4 \ntablets 320/40 mg PQP/artenimol for 3 days. Twenty-two of these patients were shown to be parasitic \nfree at the last microscopic analysis of the blood sample; three patients did not complete parasitological \nblood analysis. All patients were clinically cured. \n\n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nPharmacokinetic profiles of artenimol and piperaquine have been investigated in animal models and in \ndifferent human populations (healthy volunteers, adult patients and paediatric patients). \n \nAbsorption \nArtenimol is very rapidly absorbed, Tmax being approximately 1-2 hrs after single and multiple dosing. \nIn patients, mean Cmax (CV%) and AUCINF of artenimol (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) \nwere 752 (47%) ng/ml and 2,002 (45 %) ng/ml*h, respectively. \n \nArtenimol bioavailability appears to be higher in malaria patients than in healthy volunteers, possibly \nbecause malaria per se has an effect on artenimol disposition. This may reflect malaria-associated \nimpairment of hepatic function, causing an increase in artenimol bioavailability (reduction of first \nhepatic effect) without affecting its apparent elimination half-life, which is absorption rate limited. In \nhealthy male volunteers under fasting conditions, mean Cmax and AUCINF of artenimol ranged between \n180-252 ng/ml and 516-684 ng/ml*h, respectively. \n \nThe systemic exposure to artenimol was slightly lower following the last dose of Eurartesim (lower \nthan after the first dose by up to 15%). Artenimol pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be \nsimilar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. artenimol systemic exposure on the last \nday of treatment was higher in females than in males, the difference being within 30%. \n \nIn healthy volunteers, artenimol exposure was increased by 43% when administered with a high \nfat/high calorie meal.  \n \nPiperaquine, a highly lipophilic compound, is slowly absorbed. In humans, piperaquine has a Tmax of \napproximately 5 hours following a single and repeated dose. In patients mean (CV%) Cmax and  \nAUC0-24 (observed after the first dose of Eurartesim) were 179 (62%) ng/ml and 1,679 (47%) ng/ml*h, \nrespectively. Due to its slow elimination, piperaquine accumulates in plasma after multiple doses with \nan accumulation factor of approximately 3. Piperaquine pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be \nsimilar in healthy volunteers of Asian and Caucasian origin. On the other hand, on the last day of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n27 \n\nEurtartesim treatment, the piperaquine maximum plasma concentration was higher in female than in \nmale healthy volunteers, the difference being in the order of 30 to 50%. \n \nIn healthy volunteers, piperaquine exposure is increased approximately 3-fold when administered with \na high fat/high calorie meal. This pharmacokinetic effect is accompanied by an increased effect on \nprolongation of the QT interval. Accordingly, Eurartesim should be administered with water no less \nthan 3 hours after the last food intake, and no food should be taken within 3 hours after each dose  \n(see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nBoth piperaquine and artenimol are highly bound to human plasma proteins: the protein binding \nobserved in in vitro studies was 44-93% for artenimol and >99% for piperaquine. Moreover, from \nin vitro and in vivo data in animals, piperaquine and artenimol tend to accumulate in RBC. \n \nArtenimol was observed to have a small volume of distribution in humans (0.8 l/kg; CV 35.5%).  \nPharmacokinetic parameters observed for piperaquine in humans indicate that this active substance has \na large volume of distribution (730 l/kg; CV 37.5%). \n \nBiotransformation \nArtenimol is principally converted to α- artenimol-β-glucuronide (α- artenimol-G). Studies in human \nliver microsomes showed that artenimol was metabolised by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT1A9 and UGT2B7) to α- artenimol-G with no cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. In vitro \ndrug-drug interaction studies revealed that artenimol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2; therefore, there is the \npotential for artenimol to increase plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (see section 4.5). \n \nIn vitro metabolism studies demonstrated that piperaquine is metabolised by human hepatocytes \n(approximately 85% of piperaquine remained after 2 hours incubation at 37°C). Piperaquine was \nmainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Piperaquine was \nfound to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (also in a time-dependent way) and to a lesser extent of \nCYP2C19, while it stimulated the activity of CYP2E1.  \n \nNo effect on the metabolite profile of piperaquine in human hepatocytes was observed when \npiperaquine was co-incubated with artenimol. The piperaquine major metabolites were a carboxyl \nacid cleavage product, and a mono-N-oxidated product. \n \nIn human studies, piperaquine was found to be a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzyme while potent \ninhibitors of CYP3A4 activity caused mild inhibition of piperaquine metabolism (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life of artenimol is approximately 1 hour. The mean oral clearance for adult \npatients with malaria was 1.34 l/h/kg. The mean oral clearance was slightly higher for paediatric \npatients, however the differences were minor in magnitude (<20%). artenimol is eliminated by \nmetabolism (mainly glucuroconjugation). Its clearance was found to be slightly lower in female than \nin male healthy volunteers. Data regarding artenimol excretion in humans are scarce. However, it is \nreported in the literature that the excretion of unchanged active substance in human urine and faeces is \nnegligible for artemisinin derivatives.  \n \nThe elimination half-life of piperaquine is around 22 days for adult patients and around 20 days for \npaediatric patients. The mean oral clearance for adult patients with malaria was 2.09 l/h/kg, while in \npaediatric patients was 2.43 l/h/kg. Due to its long elimination half-life, piperaquine accumulates after \nmultiple dosing. \n \nAnimal studies showed that radiolabelled piperaquine is excreted by the biliary route, while urinary \nexcretion is negligible.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n28 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \nNo specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with hepatic or renal \ninsufficiency, or in elderly people.  \n \nIn a paediatric pharmacokinetic study, and based on very limited sampling, minor differences were \nobserved for artenimol pharmacokinetics between the paediatric and adult populations. The mean \nclearance (1.45 l/h/kg) was slightly faster in the paediatric patients than in the adult patients \n(1.34 l/h/kg), while the mean volume of distribution in the paediatric patients (0.705 l/kg) was lower \nthan in the adults (0.801 l/kg).   \n \nThe same comparison showed that piperaquine absorption rate constant and terminal half-life in \nchildren were predominantly similar to those seen in adults. However, the apparent clearance was \nfaster (1.30 versus 1.14 l/h/kg) and the apparent total volume of distribution was lower in the \npaediatric population (623 versus 730 l/kg).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGeneral toxicity \nLiterature data concerning chronic toxicity of piperaquine in dogs and monkeys indicate some \nhepatotoxicity and mild reversible depression of total white cell and neutrophil counts. \n \nThe most important nonclinical safety findings after repeated dosing were the infiltration of \nmacrophages with intracytoplasmic basophilic granular material consistent with phospholipidosis and \ndegenerative lesions in numerous organs and tissues. These adverse reactions were seen in animals at \nexposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels, and with possible relevance to clinical use. It is not \nknown whether these toxic effects are reversible. \n \nArtenimol and piperaquine were not genotoxic/clastogenic based on in vitro and in vivo testing. \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed. \n \nArtenimol causes embryolethality and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  \n \nPiperaquine did not induce malformation in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal and postnatal development \nstudy (segment III) in female rats treated with 80 mg/kg, some animals had a delay of delivery \ninducing mortality of the neonates. In females delivering normally the development, behaviour and \ngrowth of the surviving progeny was normal following exposure in utero or via milk. \n \nNo reproduction toxicity studies have been performed with the combination of artenimol and \npiperaquine. \n \nCentral nervous system (CNS) toxicity \nThere is potential for neurotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives in man and animals, which is strongly \nrelated to the dose, route and formulations of the different artenimol pro-drugs. In humans, the \npotential neurotoxicity of orally administered artenimol can be considered highly unlikely, given the \nrapid clearance ofartenimol, and its short exposure (3 days of treatment for malaria patients). There \nwas no evidence of artenimol-induced lesions in the specific nuclei in rats or dogs, even at lethal dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n29 \n\nCardiovascular toxicity \nEffects on blood pressure and on PR and QRS duration were observed at high piperaquine doses. The \nmost important potential cardiac effect was related to cardiac conduction. \n \nIn the hERG test, the IC50 was 0.15 µmol for piperaquine and 7.7 µmol forartenimol. The association \nof artenimol and piperaquine does not produce hERG inhibition greater than that of the single \ncompounds. \n \nPhototoxicity  \nThere are no phototoxicity concerns withartenimol, as it does not absorb in the range of 290-700 nm.  \nPiperaquine has an absorption maximum at 352 nm. Since piperaquine is present in the skin (about 9% \nin the non-pigmented rat and only 3% in the pigmented rat), slight phototoxic reactions (swelling and \nerythema) were observed 24 hours after oral treatment in mice exposed to UV radiation.  \n \n \n6.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of \nthe side effects are not severe and normally disappear within a few days or weeks after treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n54 \n\nIf you or your child gets a rash, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat with difficulty in \nswallowing or breathing, these may be signs of an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor immediately, or \ngo immediately to the emergency department of your nearest hospital, taking this leaflet with you. \n \nA heart problem, called QT prolongation, can occur while taking Eurartesim and for some days after \ntaking the last dose. This can cause a life-threatening abnormality of the heart rhythm. \nYour doctor may take electrical recordings of the heart (electrocardiogram, ECG) while you or \nyour child is being treated and after the last dose is given. Your doctor will advise you when \nthese readings will be taken.  \nIf you notice anything different about your or your child’s heart rhythm or have symptoms \n(such as palpitations or irregular heart beat) you should contact your doctor as soon as possible \nand before the next dose is due.  \n \nSometimes a problem with your red blood cells, called haemolytic anaemia can occur after receiving \nmalaria treatment. Contact your doctor immediately if you or your child develops one or more of the \nfollowing symptoms after treatment with Eurartesim: pale skin, general weakness, headache, shortness \nof breath and rapid heartbeat; particularly with exercise, confusion, dizziness, or dark-coloured urine.  \n \nSide effects in adults \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nAnaemia, headache, heart rhythm disturbances (ECG changes or noticing unusually fast heart beats or \npalpitations), fever, general weakness. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nInfluenza, respiratory infections, poor appetite or loss of appetite, dizziness, convulsions (fits),  \nirregular or slow heart rate, cough, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, inflammation or \nenlargement of the liver, abnormal liver function tests, itching, pain in the muscles or joints.  \n \nSide effects in children \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nInfluenza, cough, fever. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nRespiratory infections, ear infection, anaemia, abnormalities in various types of blood cells (white \nblood cells and platelets), poor appetite or loss of appetite, eye infection, heart rhythm disturbances \n(change as in adults, ECG changes), abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin inflammation, rash, \ngeneral weakness. \n \nUncommon ( may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nAbnormalities in red blood cells, excessive numbers of platelets, enlargement of some organs (such as \nliver or spleen), swollen lymph glands, convulsions (fits), headache, abnormal heart sounds (heard by \nyour doctor with a stethoscope), nose bleeds, runny nose, nausea, inflammation of the mouth, \ninflammation or enlargement of the liver, jaundice, abnormal liver function blood tests, skin itching \nand inflammation, pain in the joints. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
