PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActraphane is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe potency of human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nActraphane dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. \nPremixed insulin medicinal products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect \ntogether with a more prolonged effect is desired. Blood glucose monitoring is recommended to \nachieve optimal glycaemic control. \n \nThe individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 international unit/kg/day. \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old) \nActraphane can be used in elderly patients. \nIn elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an \nindividual basis. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. \nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the human \ninsulin dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nWhen transferring from other intermediate or long-acting insulin medicinal products, adjustment of \nthe Actraphane dose and timing of administration may be necessary. \n \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nActraphane is a dual-acting human insulin. It is a biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and \nlong-acting insulin.  \n \nActraphane is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the abdominal wall, the gluteal \nregion or the deltoid region. Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously. Injection \ninto a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection. \n \nThe needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected. \nInjection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of \nlipodystrophy. Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption compared to \nthe other injection sites. The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood \nflow, temperature and level of physical activity. \n \nAn injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates. \n \nInsulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps. \n \nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. \n \nActraphane 30 vial (40 international units/ml)/Actraphane 30 vial (100 international units/ml) \nAdministration with a syringe \n\n\n\n4 \n\nActraphane vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale. \n \nActraphane 30 Penfill \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nActraphane Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nActraphane 30 InnoLet \nAdministration with InnoLet \nActraphane InnoLet is a pre-filled pen designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable \nneedles up to a length of 8 mm. InnoLet delivers 1-50 units in increments of 1 unit. Actraphane \nInnoLet is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial \nshould be used. \n \nActraphane 30 FlexPen \nAdministration with FlexPen \nActraphane FlexPen is a pre-filled pen designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable \nneedles up to a length of 8 mm. FlexPen delivers 1-60 units in increments of 1 unit. Actraphane \nFlexPen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial \nshould be used. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. \nUsually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop gradually over a period of hours or days. They \ninclude thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry \nmouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, Actraphane must not be injected. After \nstabilisation of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections \n4.8 and 4.9).  \n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s \ninsulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in a need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Actraphane from another type of insulin \nmay require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their \nusual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during \nthe first few weeks or months. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane. \n \nCombination of Actraphane with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Actraphane is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between Actraphane and other insulin products. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism.  \n \nThe following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirement: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, \nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirement: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not \npass the placental barrier. \n \nBoth hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes \ntherapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified blood glucose control and \nmonitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase \nsubsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally \nreturn rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is no restriction on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Actraphane dose may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies with human insulin have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions below. \n \nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon – Urticaria, rash \n\n \nVery rare – Anaphylactic reactions* \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common – Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon – Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders  \n \n \n\nVery rare – Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon – Diabetic retinopathy \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nUncommon – Lipodystrophy* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon – Injection site reactions \n \nUncommon – Oedema \n \n\n* see Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulty in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. \n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular injection area reduces the risk of developing these \nreactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader \nexperience in the general population. \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate \nany differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\n• Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, \nif the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining \nconsciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to \nprevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate- or long-acting combined with fast-acting, insulin (human). ATC code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nActraphane is a dual-acting insulin. \nOnset of action is within ½ hour, reaches a maximum effect within 2–8 hours and the entire duration \nof action is up to 24 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nInsulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an \ninsulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. \n \nThis process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dose, injection route and site, thickness of \nsubcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulin medicinal products are therefore \naffected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and \nprotracted absorption respectively. The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is \nreached within 1.5–2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been \nobserved. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atcddd/indexdatabase/index.php?query=A10AD\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atcddd/indexdatabase/index.php?query=A10AD\n\n\n9 \n\nMetabolism \n \nHuman insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and \npossibly protein disulfide isomerase.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nActraphane 40 Penfill 100 international units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 international units. 1 ml suspension contains \n100 international units soluble insulin human*/isophane (NPH) insulin human* in the ratio 40/60 \n(equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n \n*Human insulin is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \n \nActraphane 40 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane 40 is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActraphane is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe potency of human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nActraphane dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. \nPremixed insulin medicinal products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect \ntogether with a more prolonged effect is desired. Blood glucose monitoring is recommended to \nachieve optimal glycaemic control. \n \nThe individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 international unit/kg/day. \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old) \nActraphane can be used in elderly patients. \nIn elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an \nindividual basis. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n\n\n13 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. \nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the human \ninsulin dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nWhen transferring from other intermediate or long-acting insulin medicinal products, adjustment of \nthe Actraphane dose and timing of administration may be necessary. \n \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nActraphane is a dual-acting human insulin. It is a biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and \nlong-acting insulin. \n \nActraphane is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the abdominal wall, the gluteal \nregion or the deltoid region. Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously. Injection \ninto a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection. \n \nThe needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected. \nInjection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of \nlipodystrophy. Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption compared to \nthe other injection sites. The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood \nflow, temperature and level of physical activity. \n \nAn injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates. \n \nInsulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps. \n \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nActraphane Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nActraphane Penfill is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instructions for use to be \nfollowed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop \ngradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, \nvomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, Actraphane must not be injected. After \nstabilisation of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections \n4.8 and 4.9).  \n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. \nUsual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s \ninsulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in a need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Actraphane from another type of insulin \nmay require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their \nusual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during \nthe first few weeks or months. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane. \n \nCombination of Actraphane with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Actraphane is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between Actraphane and other insulin products. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism.  \n \nThe following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirement: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, \nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirement: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not \npass the placental barrier. \n \nBoth hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes \ntherapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified blood glucose control and \nmonitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase \nsubsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally \nreturn rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is no restriction on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Actraphane dose may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies with human insulin have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions below. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon – Urticaria, rash \n\n \nVery rare – Anaphylactic reactions* \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common – Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon – Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders  \n \n \n\nVery rare – Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon – Diabetic retinopathy \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nUncommon – Lipodystrophy* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon – Injection site reactions \n \nUncommon – Oedema \n \n\n* see Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulty in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular injection area reduces the risk of developing these \nreactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader \nexperience in the general population. \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate \nany differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if too high a dose relative to the patient’s requirement is administered: \n• Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\n• Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, \nif the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining \nconsciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to \nprevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nActraphane 50 Penfill 100 international units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 international units. 1 ml suspension contains \n100 international units soluble insulin human*/isophane (NPH) insulin human* in the ratio 50/50 \n(equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n \n*Human insulin is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \n \nActraphane 50 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane 50 is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActraphane is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe potency of human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nActraphane dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. \nPremixed insulin medicinal products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect \ntogether with a more prolonged effect is desired. Blood glucose monitoring is recommended to \nachieve optimal glycaemic control. \n \nThe individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 international unit/kg/day. \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old) \nActraphane can be used in elderly patients. \nIn elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an \nindividual basis. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n\n\n22 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. \nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the human \ninsulin dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nWhen transferring from other intermediate or long-acting insulin medicinal products, adjustment of \nthe Actraphane dose and timing of administration may be necessary. \n \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nActraphane is a dual-acting human insulin. It is a biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and \nlong-acting insulin. \n \nActraphane is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the abdominal wall, the gluteal \nregion or the deltoid region. Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously. Injection \ninto a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection. \n \nThe needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected. \nInjection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of \nlipodystrophy. Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption compared to \nthe other injection sites. The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood \nflow, temperature and level of physical activity. \n \nAn injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates. \n \nInsulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps. \n \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nActraphane Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nActraphane Penfill is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instructions for use to be \nfollowed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop \ngradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, \nvomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, Actraphane must not be injected. After \nstabilisation of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections \n4.8 and 4.9).  \n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s \ninsulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in a need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Actraphane from another type of insulin \nmay require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their \nusual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during \nthe first few weeks or months. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane. \n \nCombination of Actraphane with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Actraphane is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between Actraphane and other insulin products. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism.  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nThe following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirement: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, \nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirement: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not \npass the placental barrier. \n \nBoth hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes \ntherapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified blood glucose control and \nmonitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase \nsubsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally \nreturn rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is no restriction on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Actraphane dose may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies with human insulin have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions below. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon – Urticaria, rash \n\n \nVery rare – Anaphylactic reactions* \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common – Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon – Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders  \n \n \n\nVery rare – Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon – Diabetic retinopathy  \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nUncommon – Lipodystrophy* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon – Injection site reactions \n \nUncommon – Oedema \n \n\n* see Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulty in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular injection area reduces the risk of developing these \nreactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader \nexperience in the general population. \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate \nany differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if too high a dose relative to the patient’s requirement is administered: \n• Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\n• Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, \nif the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining \nconsciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to \nprevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate- or long-acting combined with fast-acting, insulin (human). ATC code: A10AD01. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nActraphane is a dual-acting insulin. \nOnset of action is within ½ hour, reaches a maximum effect within 2–8 hours and the entire duration \nof action is up to 24 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atcddd/indexdatabase/index.php?query=A10AD\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atcddd/indexdatabase/index.php?query=A10AD\n\n\n27 \n\n \nInsulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an \ninsulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. \n \nThis process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dose, injection route and site, thickness of \nsubcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulin medicinal products are therefore \naffected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and \nprotracted absorption respectively. The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is \nreached within 1.5–2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been \nobserved. \n \nMetabolism \n \nHuman insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and \npossibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin \nmolecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active. \n \nElimination \n \nThe terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. The \nterminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of \ninsulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes). Trials have indicated a t½ \nof about 5–10 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nActraphane 30 40 IU/ml (international units/ml) suspension for injection in vial \nhuman insulin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n– Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n– This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n– If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \n1. What Actraphane is and what it is used for \n \nActraphane is human insulin with both a fast-acting and a long-acting effect. \n \nActraphane is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. Treatment with Actraphane helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. \n \nActraphane will start to lower your blood sugar about 30 minutes after you inject it, and the effect will \nlast for approximately 24 hours.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n \nDo not use Actraphane \n \n► If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section \n\n6.  \n► If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \n► In insulin infusion pumps. \n► If the protective cap is loose or missing. Each vial has a protective, tamper-proof plastic cap. If \n\nit is not in perfect condition when you get the vial, return the vial to your supplier. \n► If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. \n► If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use Actraphane. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. \n \nBefore using Actraphane \n \n► Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n► Remove the protective cap. \n► Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \n► Needles and syringes must not be shared. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \n► If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \n► If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n► If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \nhereof. \n\n \nOther medicines and Actraphane \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n• Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \n• Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \n• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \n• Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \n• Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \n• Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n• Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n• Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \n• Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) \n• Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \n• Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \n• Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the body’s metabolic processes) \n• Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nActraphane with alcohol \n \n► If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n► If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. Actraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n► There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n► Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \n• If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \n• If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nActraphane contains sodium \n \nActraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Actraphane \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood \nsugar. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nActraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject \nyourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly).  \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an \ninjection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. \nThe insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always \nmeasure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nHow to take Actraphane \n \nActraphane vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale. \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n1. Roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy. Resuspension is \n\neasier when the insulin has reached room temperature. \n2. Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. \n\nInject the air into the vial. \n3. Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull \n\nthe needle out of the vial. Then expel the air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct. \n \nHow to inject Actraphane \n \n► Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse. \n► Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that you have injected all \n\nthe insulin. \n► Discard the needle and syringe after each injection. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious \nand very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSummary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Inject too much insulin. \n• Eat too little or miss a meal. \n• Exercise more than usual. \n• Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2. \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \n\n\n\n71 \n\nto use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \n► If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\n► When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\n► If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink, because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \n• If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \n• If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \n► If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nList of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection may help to \nreduce the risk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the \ninjection site, tell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change \nthe absorption of your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you \nmay get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nVery rare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \nEffects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Have not injected enough insulin. \n• Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \n• Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \n• Get an infection and/or a fever. \n• Eat more than usual. \n• Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \n► If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \n► These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build–up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \n► If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\n► When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\n► If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink, because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \n• If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \n• If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \n► If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nList of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection may help to \nreduce the risk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the \ninjection site, tell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change \nthe absorption of your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you \nmay get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nVery rare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \nEffects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Have not injected enough insulin. \n• Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \n• Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \n• Get an infection and/or a fever. \n• Eat more than usual. \n• Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \n► If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \n► These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build–up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n3. How to use Actraphane \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Actraphane \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Actraphane is and what it is used for \n \nActraphane is human insulin with both a fast-acting and a long-acting effect.  \n \nActraphane is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. Treatment with Actraphane helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. \n \nActraphane will start to lower your blood sugar about 30 minutes after you inject it, and the effect will \nlast for approximately 24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n \nDo not use Actraphane \n \n► If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section \n\n6. \n► If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \n► In insulin infusion pumps. \n► If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \n► If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. \n► If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use Actraphane. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. \n \nBefore using Actraphane \n \n► Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n► Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that \n\n\n\n82 \n\nthe cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n\n► Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \n► Needles and Actraphane Penfill must not be shared. \n► Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \n► If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \n► If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \n► If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and Actraphane \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n• Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \n• Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \n• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \n• Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \n• Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \n• Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n• Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n• Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \n• Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) \n• Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \n• Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \n• Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the body’s metabolic processes) \n• Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nActraphane with alcohol \n \n► If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n► If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. Actraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n► There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n► Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \n• If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \n• If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nActraphane contains sodium \n \nActraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Actraphane  \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood \nsugar. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\nHow and where to inject \n \nActraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject \nyourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actraphane Penfill is only \nsuitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject \nyour insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an \ninjection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. \nThe insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always \nmeasure your blood sugar regularly. \n \n► Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n► Actraphane Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. \n► If you are treated with Actraphane Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \n► Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. \n \nResuspension of Actraphane \n \nAlways check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even \nresuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n \n► Every time you use a new Actraphane Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin \n\ndelivery system). \n• Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \n• Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b and back (see the picture) so that the \n\nglass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times.  \n• Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection.  \n• The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. \n• Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \n \n\n \n \nHow to inject Actraphane \n \n► Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \n► Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. \n\n► After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the \nneedle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing.  \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious \nand very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSummary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Inject too much insulin. \n• Eat too little or miss a meal. \n• Exercise more than usual. \n• Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2. \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \n► If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\n► When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\n► If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink, because you may choke. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nSerious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening.

Speak to your doctor if you \nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \n► If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \n► If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \n► If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and Actraphane \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n• Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \n• Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \n• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \n• Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \n• Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \n• Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n• Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n• Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \n• Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) \n• Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \n• Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \n• Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the body’s metabolic processes) \n• Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nActraphane with alcohol \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n► If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n► If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. Actraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n► There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n► Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \n• If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \n• If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nActraphane contains sodium \n \nActraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Actraphane \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood \nsugar. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nActraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject \nyourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actraphane InnoLet is only \n\n\n\n92 \n\nsuitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another \nmethod. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an \ninjection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. \nThe insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always \nmeasure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nHow to handle Actraphane 30 InnoLet \n \nActraphane 30 InnoLet is a pre-filled disposable pen containing a mixture of fast-acting and long-\nacting human insulin in the ratio 30/70. \n \nRead carefully the Instructions on how to use Actraphane 30 InnoLet included in this package leaflet. \nYou must use the pen as described in the Instructions on how to use Actraphane 30 InnoLet. \n \nAlways ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious \nand very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSummary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Inject too much insulin. \n• Eat too little or miss a meal. \n• Exercise more than usual. \n• Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2. \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \n► If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\n► When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\n► If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink, because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \n• If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \n• If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \n► If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nList of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection may help to \nreduce the risk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the \ninjection site, tell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change \nthe absorption of your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you \nmay get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nVery rare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \nEffects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Have not injected enough insulin. \n• Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \n• Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \n• Get an infection and/or a fever. \n• Eat more than usual. \n• Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \n► If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \n► These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build–up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5. How to store Actraphane \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date, which is stated on the InnoLet label and carton after \n‘EXP’. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nBefore opening: Store in a refrigerator at 2°C – 8°C. Keep away from the cooling element.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Actraphane 30 contains \n \n– The active substance is human insulin. Actraphane is a mixture consisting of 30% soluble \n\nhuman insulin and 70% isophane human insulin. Each ml contains 100 IU of human insulin. \nEach pre-filled pen contains 300 IU of human insulin in 3 ml suspension for injection. \n\n– The other ingredients are zinc chloride, glycerol, metacresol, phenol, disodium phosphate \ndihydrate, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, protamine sulfate and water for injections. \n\n \nWhat Actraphane looks like and contents of the pack \n \nActraphane is presented as a suspension for injection. After resuspension, the liquid should appear \nuniformly white and cloudy. \nPack sizes of 1, 5 and 10 pre-filled pens of 3 ml. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer  \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S, Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsværd, Denmark \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your InnoLet. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n96 \n\nInstructions on how to use Actraphane 30 suspension for injection in InnoLet \n \nRead the instructions carefully before using your InnoLet. If you do not follow the instructions \ncarefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar \nlevel. \n \nYour InnoLet is a simple, compact pre-filled pen able to deliver 1 to 50 units in increments of 1 unit. \nInnoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length of \n8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your InnoLet \nis lost or damaged. \n \n\n \nPush-button \n\nDose \nselector \n\nPen cap \n\nCompartment \nfor needles \n\nResidual \nscale \n\nInsulin cartridge \n\nGlass ball \n\nPaper tab \n\nNeedle \n\nInner needle \ncap \n\nBig outer  \nneedle cap \n\nDisposable needle (example) \n\nDose scale \n\n \n \nGetting started \n \nCheck the name and coloured label of your InnoLet to make sure that it contains the correct type of \ninsulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. Take off the pen cap. \nResuspending is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. \n \nResuspending the insulin \n \nBefore every injection: \n• Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspension. If \n\nthere are less than 12 units left, use a new InnoLet. \n• Move the pen up and down between positions A and B and back so that the glass ball moves \n\nfrom one end of the cartridge to the other (picture 1A) at least 20 times. Repeat this movement \nat least 10 times before each injection. The movement must always be repeated until the liquid \nappears uniformly white and cloudy. \n\n• Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. If you do not \nresuspend the insulin, this may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too low \nblood sugar level. After resuspending, complete all of the following stages of injection \nwithout delay. \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n\n 1A \n\n \n \nAttaching the needle \n \n• Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \n\nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \n• Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \n• Remove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. \n• Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your InnoLet (picture 1B). \n• Pull off the big outer needle cap and the inner needle cap. You may want to store the big \n\nouter needle cap in the compartment. \n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the \n\nneedle. \n \n\n \n\n 1B \n\n \n \nPriming to expel air prior to each injection \n \nSmall amounts of air may collect in the needle and cartridge during normal use. \n \nTo avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \n• Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise. \n• Hold your InnoLet with the needle upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \n\nfew times (picture 1C) to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n• Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to 0. \n• Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before injection (picture 1C). This \n\nmakes sure the insulin flows. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than \n6 times. \n\n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the device is defective and must not be used. \n \n• If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose selector may move. \n\nThis may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n• Always prime InnoLet before you inject. If you do not prime InnoLet, you may get too little \ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n\n \n\n \n\n 1C \n\n \n \nSetting the dose \n \n• Always check that the push-button is fully depressed and the dose selector is set to 0. \n• Dial the number of units required by turning the dose selector clockwise (picture 2). \n• You will hear a click for every single unit dialled. The dose can be corrected by turning the \n\ndial either way. Make sure not to turn the dial or correct the dose when the needle is inserted in \nthe skin. This may lead to inaccurate dosing that can make your blood sugar level too high or \ntoo low. \n\n \nAlways use the dose scale and the dose selector to see how many units you have selected before \ninjecting the insulin. Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your \nblood sugar level may get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows \napproximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n\n \nYou cannot set a dose larger than the number of units remaining in the cartridge. \n \n\n \n\n 2 \n\n \n \nInjecting the insulin \n \n• Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor. \n• Deliver the dose by pressing the push-button fully down (picture 3). You will hear clicks as \n\nthe dose selector returns to 0. \n• After the injection, the needle should remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure \n\nthat the full dose has been delivered. \n• Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed \n\nto return to 0 when you press the push-button. Always make sure that the dose selector returns \nto 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been \ndelivered, which may result in too high blood sugar level. \n\n• Discard the needle after each injection. \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\n 3 \n\n \n \nRemoving the needle \n \n• Replace the big outer needle cap and unscrew the needle (picture 4). Dispose of it carefully. \n• Put the pen cap back on your InnoLet to protect the insulin from light. \n \n\n 4 \n\n \n \n \nAlways use a new needle for each injection. \nAlways remove and discard the needle after each injection and store your InnoLet without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and \ninaccurate dosing. \n \nFurther important information \n \nCaregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle sticks and \ncross-infection. \n \nDispose of your used InnoLet carefully without the needle attached. \n \nNever share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n \nNever share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n \nAlways keep your InnoLet and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nYour InnoLet is designed to work accurately and safely. It must be handled with care. If it is dropped, \ndamaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can \nlead to too high or too low blood sugar level. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \nYou can clean your InnoLet by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, wash or lubricate it. \nThis may damage the mechanism and may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too \nlow blood sugar level. \n \nDo not refill your InnoLet. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n\n\n\n101 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nActraphane 30 FlexPen 100 IU/ml (international units/ml) suspension for injection in pre-filled \npen \n\nhuman insulin \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n– Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n– This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n3. How to use Actraphane \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Actraphane \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Actraphane is and what it is used for \n \nActraphane is human insulin with both a fast-acting and a long-acting effect. \n \nActraphane is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. Treatment with Actraphane helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. \n \nActraphane will start to lower your blood sugar about 30 minutes after you inject it, and the effect will \nlast for approximately 24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n \nDo not use Actraphane \n \n► If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section \n\n6. \n► If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \n► In insulin infusion pumps. \n► If FlexPen is dropped, damaged or crushed. \n► If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. \n► If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use Actraphane. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. \n \nBefore using Actraphane \n \n► Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n► Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \n► Needles and Actraphane FlexPen must not be shared. \n\n\n\n102 \n\n► Actraphane FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \n► If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \n► If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \n► If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and Actraphane \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n• Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \n• Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \n• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \n• Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \n• Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \n• Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n• Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n• Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \n• Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) \n• Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \n• Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \n• Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the body’s metabolic processes) \n• Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nActraphane with alcohol \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n► If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n► If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. Actraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your \ndiabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n► There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n► Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \n• If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \n• If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nActraphane contains sodium \n \nActraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Actraphane \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood \nsugar. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nActraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject \nyourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actraphane FlexPen is only \n\n\n\n104 \n\nsuitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another \nmethod. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an \ninjection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. \nThe insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always \nmeasure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nHow to handle Actraphane 30 FlexPen \n \nActraphane 30 FlexPen is a pre-filled disposable pen containing a mixture of fast-acting and long-\nacting human insulin in the ratio 30/70. \n \nRead carefully the Instructions on how to use Actraphane 30 FlexPen included in this package leaflet. \nYou must use the pen as described in the Instructions on how to use Actraphane 30 FlexPen. \n \nAlways ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious \nand very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSummary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Inject too much insulin. \n• Eat too little or miss a meal. \n• Exercise more than usual. \n• Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2. \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \n\n\n\n105 \n\nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \n► If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\n► When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\n► If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink, because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \n• If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \n• If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \n► If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nList of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection may help to \nreduce the risk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the \ninjection site, tell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change \nthe absorption of your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you \nmay get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \n\n\n\n106 \n\nVery rare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \nEffects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Have not injected enough insulin. \n• Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \n• Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \n• Get an infection and/or a fever. \n• Eat more than usual. \n• Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \n► If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \n► These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build–up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Actraphane 30 contains \n \n– The active substance is human insulin. Actraphane is a mixture consisting of 30% soluble \n\nhuman insulin and 70% isophane human insulin. Each ml contains 100 IU of human insulin. \nEach pre-filled pen contains 300 IU of human insulin in 3 ml suspension for injection. \n\n– The other ingredients are zinc chloride, glycerol, metacresol, phenol, disodium phosphate \ndihydrate, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, protamine sulfate and water for injections. \n\n \nWhat Actraphane looks like and contents of the pack \n \nActraphane is presented as a suspension for injection. After resuspension, the liquid should appear \nuniformly white and cloudy. \nPack sizes of 1, 5 and 10 pre-filled pens of 3 ml. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S, Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsværd, Denmark \n \nManufacturer \n \nThe manufacturer can be identified by the batch number printed on the slip of the carton and on the \nlabel: \n \n– If the second and third characters are S6, P5, K7, R7, VG, FG or ZF, the manufacturer is Novo \n\nNordisk A/S, Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsværd, Denmark. \n \n– If the second and third characters are H7 or T6, the manufacturer is Novo Nordisk Production \n\nSAS, 45 Avenue d’Orléans, F-28000 Chartres, France. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your FlexPen. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n108 \n\nInstructions on how to use Actraphane 30 suspension for injection in FlexPen \n \nRead the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the \ninstructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low \nblood sugar level. \n \nYour FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in \nincrements of 1 unit. FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles \nup to a length of 8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in \ncase your FlexPen is lost or damaged. \n \n Actraphane 30 FlexPen \n\nPen cap \n\nCartridge \n\nResidual \nscale \n\nPointer \n\nDose \nselector \n\nPush- \nbutton \n\nBig outer  \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle Paper tab Inner \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle (example) \nGlass \nball \n\n12 units \n\n \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nYour FlexPen must be handled with care.  \nIf it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate \ndosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. \n \nYou can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak it, wash \nor lubricate it as it may damage the pen. \n \nDo not refill your FlexPen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n \nPreparing your Actraphane 30 FlexPen \n \nA \nCheck the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of \ninsulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n \nEvery time you use a new pen \nLet the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. \nThis makes it easier to resuspend. Pull off the pen cap (see A). \n \n A \n\n \n \nB \nBefore your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: \nMove the pen up and down twenty times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball moves \nfrom one end of the cartridge to the other. Repeat until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. \n \nFor every following injection, move the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times \nuntil the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. \n \n\n\n\n109 \n\nAlways make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces the risk \nof too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, complete all the \nfollowing steps of injection without delay. \n \n B \n\n \n \n\n Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If \nthere are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. \nSee the big picture on top of this instruction. \n\n \n Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white and cloudy. \n\n \nAttaching the needle \n \nC \nRemove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. \n \nScrew the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. \n \n C \n\n \n \nD \nPull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later. \n \n D \n\n \n \nE \nPull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. \n \nNever try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. \n \n E \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \n\n \n Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \n\n \nChecking the insulin flow \n \nF \n\n\n\n110 \n\nPrior to each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To \navoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \nTurn the dose selector to select 2 units. \n \n F \n\n2 units \nselected \n  \n\n \nG \nHold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \nfew times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n \n G \n\n \n \nH \nKeeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. \n \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no \nmore than 6 times. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. \n \n H \n\n \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that \nthe insulin flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose \nselector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \nSelecting your dose \n \nI \nCheck that the dose selector is set at 0. \nTurn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. \n \nThe dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-\nbutton as insulin will come out. \n \nYou cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. \n \n\n\n\n111 \n\n I \n\n5 units \nselected \n \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\n Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before \ninjecting the insulin. \n\n \n Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \n\nget too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much \ninsulin is left in your pen. \n\n \nMaking the injection \n \nJ \nInsert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. \n \nInject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful \nonly to push the push-button when injecting. \nTurning the dose selector will not inject insulin. \n \n J \n\n \n \nK \nKeep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds. \nThis will make sure you get the full dose. \n \nWithdraw the needle from the skin then release the pressure on the push-button. \n \nAlways make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops \nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood sugar \nlevel. \n \n K \n\n \n \nL \nLead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, \ncarefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle. \n \nDispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on. \n \n\n\n\n112 \n\n L \n\n \n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles \nand inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nFurther important information \n \n\n Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle \nsticks and cross-infection. \n\n \n Dispose of your used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. \n\n \n Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n\n \n Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n\n \n Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n\n\n\n113 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nActraphane 40 Penfill 100 IU/ml (international units/ml) suspension for injection in cartridge \nhuman insulin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n– Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n– This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n– If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Actraphane is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n3. How to use Actraphane \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Actraphane \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Actraphane is and what it is used for \n \nActraphane is human insulin with both a fast-acting and a long-acting effect. \n \nActraphane is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. Treatment with Actraphane helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. \n \nActraphane will start to lower your blood sugar about 30 minutes after you inject it, and the effect will \nlast for approximately 24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n \nDo not use Actraphane \n \n► If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section \n\n6. \n► If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \n► In insulin infusion pumps. \n► If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \n► If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. \n► If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use Actraphane. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. \n \nBefore using Actraphane  \n \n► Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n► Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that \n\n\n\n114 \n\nthe cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n\n► Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \n► Needles and Actraphane Penfill must not be shared. \n► Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \n► If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \n► If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \n► If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and Actraphane \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n• Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \n• Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \n• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \n• Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \n• Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \n• Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n• Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n• Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \n• Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) \n• Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \n• Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \n• Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the body’s metabolic processes) \n• Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nActraphane with alcohol \n \n► If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n► If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. \nActraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during \npregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of \nhypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n► There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n► Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \n• If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \n• If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nActraphane contains sodium \n \nActraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Actraphane \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood \nsugar. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \nHow and where to inject \n \nActraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject \nyourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actraphane Penfill is only \nsuitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject \nyour insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an \ninjection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. \nThe insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always \nmeasure your blood sugar regularly. \n \n► Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n► Actraphane Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. \n► If you are treated with Actraphane Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \n►  Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. \n \nResuspension of Actraphane \n \nAlways check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even \nresuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n \n► Every time you use a new Actraphane Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin \n\ndelivery system). \n• Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \n• Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b and back (see the picture) so that the \n\nglass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times. \n• Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection. \n• The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. \n• Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \n \n\n \n \nHow to inject Actraphane \n \n► Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \n► Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. \n\n► After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the \nneedle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing.  \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \n\n\n\n117 \n\nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious \nand very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSummary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Inject too much insulin. \n• Eat too little or miss a meal. \n• Exercise more than usual. \n• Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2. \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are \nconscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \n► If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\n► When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\n► If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink, because you may choke. \n \n\n\n\n118 \n\nSerious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) \nis a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 \npeople. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \n• If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \n• If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \n► If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nList of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor \nimmediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection may help to \nreduce the risk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the \ninjection site, tell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change \nthe absorption of your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you \nmay get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nVery rare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \nEffects from diabetes  \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Have not injected enough insulin. \n• Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. \n• Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. \n• Get an infection and/or a fever. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n119 \n\n• Eat more than usual. \n• Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \n► If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \n► These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build–up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n3. How to use Actraphane \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Actraphane \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Actraphane is and what it is used for \n \nActraphane is human insulin with both a fast-acting and a long-acting effect. \n \nActraphane is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. Treatment with Actraphane helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. \n \nActraphane will start to lower your blood sugar about 30 minutes after you inject it, and the effect will \nlast for approximately 24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Actraphane \n \nDo not use Actraphane \n \n► If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section \n\n6.  \n► If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \n► In insulin infusion pumps. \n► If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \n► If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. \n► If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use Actraphane. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. \n \nBefore using Actraphane  \n \n► Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \n► Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that \n\n\n\n122 \n\nthe cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n\n► Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \n► Needles and Actraphane Penfill must not be shared. \n► Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \n► If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \n► If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \n► If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \n► If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and Actraphane \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nSome medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n• Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \n• Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \n• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \n• Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \n• Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \n• Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n• Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n• Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \n• Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) \n• Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \n• Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \n• Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the body’s metabolic processes) \n• Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nActraphane with alcohol \n \n► If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n► If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. \nActraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during \npregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of \nhypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n► There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n► Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \n• If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \n• If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nActraphane contains sodium \n \nActraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Actraphane \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood \nsugar. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nActraphane can be used in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \nHow and where to inject \n \nActraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject \nyourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actraphane Penfill is only \nsuitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject \nyour insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an \ninjection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. \nThe insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always \nmeasure your blood sugar regularly. \n \n► Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n► Actraphane Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. \n► If you are treated with Actraphane Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \n► Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. \n \nResuspension of Actraphane \n \nAlways check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even \nresuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n \n► Every time you use a new Actraphane Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin \n\ndelivery system). \n• Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \n• Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b and back (see the picture) so that the \n\nglass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times. \n• Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection. \n• The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. \n• Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \n \n\n \n \nHow to inject Actraphane \n \n► Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \n► Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. \n\n► After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the \nneedle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing.  \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \n\n\n\n125 \n\nIf you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious \nand very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSummary of serious and very common side effects \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 \npeople. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \n• Inject too much insulin. \n• Eat too little or miss a meal. \n• Exercise more than usual. \n• Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2. \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how \nto use it.
