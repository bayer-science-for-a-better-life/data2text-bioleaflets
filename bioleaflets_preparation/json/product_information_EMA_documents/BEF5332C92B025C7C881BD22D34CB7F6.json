NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax 50 micrograms/500 micrograms inhalation powder \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach metered dose contains 50 micrograms of salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) and 500 micrograms of \n\nfluticasone propionate. \n\n \n\nEach delivered dose (the dose from the mouthpiece) contains 45 micrograms of salmeterol (as salmeterol \n\nxinafoate) and 465 micrograms of fluticasone propionate. \n\n \n\n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n\nEach dose contains approximately 10 milligrams of lactose (as monohydrate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nInhalation powder. \n\n \n\nWhite powder. \n\n \n\nWhite inhaler with a semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax is indicated for use in adults aged 18 years and older only. \n\n \n\nAsthma \n\nAerivio Spiromax is indicated for the regular treatment of patients with severe asthma where use of a \n\ncombination product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist) is appropriate: \n\n \n\n- patients not adequately controlled on a lower strength corticosteroid combination product  \n\nor \n\n- patients already controlled on a high dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist. \n\n \n\n \n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) \n\nAerivio Spiromax is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD, with a FEV1 <60% \n\npredicted normal (pre-bronchodilator) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant \n\nsymptoms despite regular bronchodilator therapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax is indicated in adults 18 years of age and older only. \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not indicated for use in children, 12 years of age and younger or adolescents, 13 to 17 \n\nyears of age. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRoute of administration: Inhalation use \n\n \n\nPatients should be made aware that Aerivio Spiromax must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when \n\nasymptomatic. \n\n \n\nPatients should be regularly reassessed by a doctor, so that the strength of the salmeterol/fluticasone \n\npropionate inhaler they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose \n\nshould be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. Aerivio \n\nSpiromax is not available on the market at strengths lower than 50/500 microgram. When it is appropriate to \n\ntitrate down to a lower strength not available for Aerivio Spiromax, a change to an alternative fixed-dose \n\ncombination of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate containing a lower dose of the inhaled corticosteroid is \n\nrequired. \n\n \n\nPatients should be given a strength of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate inhaler containing the appropriate \n\nfluticasone propionate dosage for the severity of their disease.   Aerivio Spiromax is only appropriate for use \n\nin the treatment of patients with severe asthma.  If an individual patient should require dosages outside the \n\nrecommended regimen, appropriate doses of β2 agonist and/or corticosteroid should be prescribed \n\n \n\nRecommended doses: \n\n \n\nAsthma \n\nAdults aged 18 years and older. \n\n \n\nOne inhalation of 50 micrograms salmeterol and 500 micrograms fluticasone propionate twice daily. \n\n \n\nOnce control of asthma is attained treatment should be reviewed and consideration given as to whether \n\npatients should be stepped down to an alternative fixed-dose combination of salmeterol and fluticasone \n\npropionate containing a lower dose of the inhaled corticosteroid and then ultimately to an inhaled \n\ncorticosteroid alone. Regular review of patients as treatment is stepped down is important. \n\n \n\nA clear benefit has not been shown as compared with inhaled fluticasone propionate alone used as initial \n\nmaintenance therapy when one or two of the criteria of severity are missing. In general inhaled \n\ncorticosteroids remain the first line treatment for most patients.  \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax is for the treatment of patients with severe asthma only. It should not be used for the \n\ntreatment of patients with mild or moderate asthma or for the initiation of treatment for patients with severe \n\nasthma unless the requirement for such a high dose of the corticosteroid together with a long-acting β2 \nagonist has been established previously.  \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not intended as the treatment of asthma when a fixed-dose combination of salmeterol \n\nand fluticasone propionate is required for the first time.  Patients should commence treatment with a fixed-\n\ndose combination containing a lower dose of the corticosteroid component and will then be titrated up in \n\nrespect of the corticosteroid dose until control of asthma is achieved.  Once control of asthma is achieved \n\npatients should be reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid titrated downwards as \n\nappropriate to maintain disease control. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to establish the appropriate dosage of inhaled corticosteroid before any fixed-dose \n\ncombination can be used in patients with severe asthma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not recommended for use in either children aged 12 years of age and younger or in \n\nadolescents aged 13 to 17 years. The safety and efficacy of Aerivio Spiromax in children and adolescents \n\naged less than 18 years of age has not been established.  \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nCOPD \n\nOne inhalation of 50 micrograms salmeterol and 500 micrograms fluticasone propionate twice daily. \n\n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nThere is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment.  \n\n \n\nThere are no data available on the use of Aerivio Spiromax in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration/Instructions for use  \n\n \n\nThe Spiromax device is a breath actuated, inspiratory flow-driven inhaler, which means that the active \n\nsubstances are delivered into the airways when the patient inhales through the mouthpiece. Patients with \n\nsevere asthma and COPD were shown to be able to generate sufficient inspiratory flow rate when they \n\nbreathed in forcefully through the Spiromax device to enable the delivery of the required therapeutic dose to \n\nthe lungs (see also section 5.1 – last five paragraphs)  \n\n \n\nRequired training \n\nAerivio Spiromax should be used correctly in order to achieve effective treatment. As such, the patients \n\nshould be advised to read the patient information leaflet carefully and follow the instructions for use as \n\ndetailed in the leaflet. All patients should be provided with training by the prescribing Health Care \n\nProfessional on how to use Aerivio Spiromax. This is to ensure that they understand how to use the inhaler \n\ncorrectly, and so that they understand the need to breathe in forcefully when inhaling to obtain the required \n\ndose.  It is important to inhale forcefully to ensure optimal dosing. \n\n \n\nThe use of Aerivio Spiromax follows three simple steps: open, breathe and close which are outlined below. \n\n \n\nOpen: Hold the Spiromax with the mouthpiece cover at the bottom and open the mouthpiece cover by \n\nfolding it down until it is fully opened when one click is heard. \n\n \n\nBreathe: Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe through your inhaler. Place the \n\nmouthpiece between the teeth with the lips closed around the mouthpiece, do not bite the mouthpiece of the \n\ninhaler. Breathe in forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece. Remove the Spiromax device from the \n\nmouth and hold the breath for 10 seconds or as long as comfortable for the patients. \n\n \n\nClose: Breathe out gently and close the mouthpiece cover. \n\n \n\nPatients should not block the air vents at any time, or breathe out through the Spiromax device when they are \n\npreparing the “Breathe” step. Patients are not required to shake the inhaler prior to use.  \n\n \n\nPatients should also be advised to rinse their mouth with water and spit the water out, and/or brush their teeth \n\nafter inhaling (see section 4.4) \n\n \n\nPatients may notice a taste when using Aerivio Spiromax due to the lactose excipient. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAsthma \n\nAerivio Spiromax is for use in patients with severe asthma only. It should not be used to treat acute asthma \n\nsymptoms for which a fast- and short-acting bronchodilator is required. Patients should be advised to have \n\ntheir inhaler to be used for relief in an acute asthma attack available at all times. \n\n \n\nPatients should not be initiated on Aerivio Spiromax during an exacerbation, or if they have significantly \n\nworsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. \n\n \n\nSerious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with Aerivio Spiromax. \n\nPatients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain \n\nuncontrolled or worsen after initiation on Aerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nIncreased requirements for use of reliever medication (short-acting bronchodilators), or decreased response \n\nto reliever medication indicate deterioration of asthma control and patients should be reviewed by a \n\nphysician. \n\n \n\nSudden and progressive deterioration in control of asthma is potentially life-threatening and the patient \n\nshould undergo urgent medical assessment. Consideration should be given to increasing corticosteroid \n\ntherapy.  \n\n \n\nOnce asthma symptoms are controlled, consideration may be given to gradually reducing the dose of the \n\ninhaled corticosteroid and therefore a change to an alternative fixed-dose combination of salmeterol and \n\nfluticasone propionate containing a lower dose of the inhaled corticosteroid is required. Regular review of \n\npatients as treatment is stepped down is important. The lowest dose of inhaled corticosteroid should be used. \n\n \n\nCOPD \n\nFor patients with COPD experiencing exacerbations, treatment with systemic corticosteroids is typically \n\nindicated, therefore patients should be instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms deteriorate with \n\nAerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nCessation of therapy \n\nTreatment with Aerivio Spiromax should not be stopped abruptly in patients with asthma due to risk of \n\nexacerbation. Therapy should be down-titrated under physician supervision. For patients with COPD \n\ncessation of therapy may also be associated with symptomatic decompensation and should be supervised by \n\na physician. \n\n \n\nCaution with special diseases \n\nAerivio Spiromax should be administered with caution in patients with active or quiescent pulmonary \n\ntuberculosis and fungal, viral or other infections of the airway. Appropriate treatment should be promptly \n\ninstituted, if indicated. \n\n \n\nRarely, Aerivio Spiromax may cause cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles and \n\natrial fibrillation, and a mild transient reduction in serum potassium at high therapeutic doses. Aerivio \n\nSpiromax should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disorders or heart rhythm \n\nabnormalities and in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected hypokalaemia or patients \n\npredisposed to low levels of serum potassium. \n\nThere have been very rare reports of increases in blood glucose levels (see section 4.8) and this should be \n\nconsidered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\nParodoxical bronchospasm \n\nParadoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after \n\ndosing. Paradoxical bronchospasm responds to a rapid-acting bronchodilator and should be treated \n\nstraightaway. Aerivio Spiromax should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative \n\ntherapy instituted if necessary. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nβeta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists \n\nThe pharmacological effects of β2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, palpitations and headache, have been \n\nreported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. \n\n \n\nSystemic effects \n\nSystemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long \n\nperiods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects \n\ninclude Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in bone mineral density, \n\ncataract and glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including \n\npsychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children) (see \n\nPaediatric population sub-heading below for information on the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids in \n\nchildren and adolescents). It is important, therefore, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose \n\nof inhaled corticosteroid is reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is \n\nmaintained. \n\n \n\nVisual disturbance \n\nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with \n\nsymptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to \n\nan ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases \n\nsuch as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical \n\ncorticosteroids. \n\n \n\nAdrenal function \n\nProlonged treatment of patients with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids may result in adrenal suppression \n\nand acute adrenal crisis. Very rare cases of adrenal suppression and acute adrenal crisis have also been \n\ndescribed with doses of fluticasone propionate between 500 and less than 1000 micrograms. Situations, \n\nwhich could potentially trigger acute adrenal crisis include trauma, surgery, infection or any rapid reduction \n\nin dosage. Presenting symptoms are typically vague and may include anorexia, abdominal pain, weight loss, \n\ntiredness, headache, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, decreased level of consciousness, hypoglycaemia, and \n\nseizures. Additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective \n\nsurgery. \n\n \n\nThe benefits of inhaled fluticasone propionate therapy should minimise the need for oral steroids, but \n\npatients transferring from oral steroids may remain at risk of impaired adrenal reserve for a considerable \n\ntime. Therefore these patients should be treated with special care and adrenocortical function regularly \n\nmonitored. Patients who have required high dose emergency corticosteroid therapy in the past may also be at \n\nrisk. This possibility of residual impairment should always be borne in mind in emergency and elective \n\nsituations likely to produce stress, and appropriate corticosteroid treatment must be considered. The extent of \n\nthe adrenal impairment may require specialist advice before elective procedures. \n\n \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products \n\nRitonavir can greatly increase the concentration of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, concomitant \n\nuse should be avoided, unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid \n\nside effects. There is also an increased risk of systemic undesirable effects when combining fluticasone \n\npropionate with other potent CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of systemic ketoconazole significantly increases systemic exposure to salmeterol. This may \n\nlead to an increase in the incidence of systemic effects (e.g. prolongation in the QTc interval and \n\npalpitations). Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should therefore \n\nbe avoided unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risk of systemic undesirable effects of \n\nsalmeterol treatment (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nRespiratory tract infections \n\nThere was an increased reporting of lower respiratory tract infections (particularly pneumonia and \n\nbronchitis) in the TORCH study in patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate \n\n50/500 micrograms twice daily compared with placebo as well as in studies SCO40043 and SCO100250 \n\ncomparing a lower dose of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 micrograms twice daily, (a dose not \n\nauthorised for use in COPD) with salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily only (see section 4.8 and section \n\n5.1). A similar incidence of pneumonia in the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate group was seen across all \n\nstudies. In TORCH, older patients, patients with a lower body mass index (<25 kg/m\n2\n) and patients with very \n\nsevere disease (FEV1<30% predicted) were at greatest risk of developing pneumonia regardless of treatment.  \n\n \n\nPhysicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia and other lower respiratory \n\ntract infections in patients with COPD as the clinical features of such infections and exacerbation frequently \n\noverlap. If a patient with severe COPD has experienced pneumonia, treatment with Aerivio Spiromax should \n\nbe re-evaluated. \n\n \n\nPneumonia in patients with COPD \n\nAn increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been \n\nobserved in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an increased \n\nrisk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nThere is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk \n\namong inhaled corticosteroid products. \n\n \n\nPhysicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the \n\nclinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations.  If a patient with \n\nsevere COPD has experienced pneumonia, treatment with Aerivio Spiromax should be re-evaluated. \n\n \n\nRisk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass index \n\n(BMI) and severe COPD. \n\n \n\nEthnic populations \n\nData from a large clinical trial (the Salmeterol Multi-Center Asthma Research Trial, SMART) suggested \n\nAfrican-American patients were at increased risk of serious respiratory-related events or deaths when using \n\nsalmeterol compared with placebo (see section 5.1). It is not known if this was due to pharmacogenetic or \n\nother factors. Patients of black African or Afro-Caribbean ancestry should therefore be asked to continue \n\ntreatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen whilst using \n\nAerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Population \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years (see Section \n\n4.2). However, it should be noted that children and adolescents less than 16 years taking high doses of \n\nfluticasone propionate (typically ≥ 1000 micrograms/day) may be at particular risk.  Systemic effects may \n\noccur, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods.  Possible systemic effects include Cushing's \n\nsyndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, acute adrenal crisis and growth retardation in children \n\nand adolescents and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor \n\nhyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression.  Consideration should be given to referring \n\nthe child or adolescent to a paediatric respiratory specialist.  It is recommended that the height of children \n\nreceiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. The dose of inhaled \n\ncorticosteroid should always be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. \n\n \n\nOral infections \n\nDue to the fluticasone propionate component, hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat \n\nand, rarely of the oesophagus, can occur in some patients. Both hoarseness and the incidence of candidiasis \n\nof the mouth and throat may be relieved by rinsing the mouth with water and spitting the water out and/or \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nbrushing the teeth after using the product. Symptomatic candidiasis of the mouth and throat can be treated \n\nwith topical anti-fungal therapy whilst still continuing with Aerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with severe lactose intolerance should use this medicine \n\nwith caution and those with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \n\nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The excipient lactose may contain small \n\namounts of milk proteins which may cause allergic reactions in those with severe hypersensitivity or allergy \n\nto milk protein. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nBeta adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of salmeterol. Both non-selective and selective \n\nβ blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Potentially serious \n\nhypokalaemia may result from β2 agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this \n\neffect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids and diuretics. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of other β adrenergic-containing medicinal products can have a potentially additive effect. \n\n \n\nSalmeterol \n\nPotent CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once daily) and salmeterol (50 micrograms inhaled twice \n\ndaily) in 15 healthy subjects for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure (1.4-\n\nfold Cmax and 15-fold AUC). This may lead to an increase in the incidence of other systemic effects of \n\nsalmeterol treatment (e.g. prolongation of QTc interval and palpitations) compared with salmeterol or \n\nketoconazole treatment alone (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nClinically significant effects were not seen on blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose and blood potassium \n\nlevels. Co-administration with ketoconazole did not increase the elimination half-life of salmeterol or \n\nincrease salmeterol accumulation with repeat dosing. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of ketoconazole should be avoided, unless the benefits outweigh the \n\npotentially increased risk of systemic effects of salmeterol treatment. There is likely to be a similar risk of \n\ninteraction with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, ritonavir). \n\n \n\nModerate CYP 3A4 inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of erythromycin (500 mg orally three times a day) and salmeterol (50 micrograms inhaled \n\ntwice daily) in 15 healthy subjects for 6 days resulted in a small but non-statistically significant increase in \n\nsalmeterol exposure (1.4-fold Cmax and 1.2-fold AUC). Co-administration with erythromycin was not \n\nassociated with any serious adverse effects. \n\n \n\nFluticasone propionate \n\nUnder normal circumstances, low plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate are achieved after inhaled \n\ndosing, due to extensive first pass metabolism and high systemic clearance mediated by cytochrome P450 \n\n3A4 in the gut and liver. Hence, clinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone propionate \n\nare unlikely. \n\n \n\nIn an interaction study in healthy subjects with intranasal fluticasone propionate, ritonavir (a highly potent \n\ncytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor) 100 mg twice daily increased the fluticasone propionate plasma \n\nconcentrations several hundred fold, resulting in markedly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. \n\nInformation about this interaction is lacking for inhaled fluticasone propionate, but a marked increase in \n\nfluticasone propionate plasma levels is expected. Cases of Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have \n\nbeen reported. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of \n\nsystemic glucocorticoid undesirable effects. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn a small study in healthy volunteers, the slightly less potent CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole increased the \n\nexposure of fluticasone propionate after a single inhalation by 150%. This resulted in a greater reduction of \n\nplasma cortisol as compared with fluticasone propionate alone. Co-treatment with other potent CYP3A \n\ninhibitors, such as itraconazole, and moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as erythromycin, is also expected to \n\nincrease the systemic fluticasone propionate exposure and the risk of systemic undesirable effects. Caution is \n\nrecommended and long-term treatment with such drugs should if possible be avoided. \n\n \n\nCo-treatment with CYP3A inhibitors, including cobicistat-containing products, is expected to increase the \n\nrisk of systemic side-effects. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased \n\nrisk of systemic corticosteroid side-effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic \n\ncorticosteroid effects. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300 to 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicates no \n\nmalformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate. Animal studies have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity after administration of β2 adrenoreceptor agonists and glucocorticosteroids (see section \n\n5.3). \n \n\nAdministration of Aerivio Spiromax to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to \n\nthe mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. \n\n \n\nThe lowest effective dose of fluticasone propionate needed to maintain adequate asthma control should be \n\nused in the treatment of pregnant women. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIt is unknown whether salmeterol and fluticasone propionate /metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \n\n \n\nStudies have shown that salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and their metabolites, are excreted into the \n\nmilk of lactating rats.  \n\n \n\nA risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \n\nbreastfeeding or to discontinue Aerivio Spiromax therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for \n\nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data in humans. However, animal studies showed no effects of salmeterol or fluticasone \n\npropionate on fertility. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\nAs Aerivio Spiromax contains salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, the type and severity of adverse \n\nreactions associated with each of the active substance may be expected. There is no incidence of additional \n\nadverse events following concurrent administration of the two active substances. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions which have been associated with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate are given below, listed \n\nby system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (1/100 to \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n1/10), uncommon (1/1000 to 1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1000) and not known (frequency cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data).

See section 5.1. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe pharmacological effects of β2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, palpitations and headache, have been \n\nreported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. \n\n \n\nParadoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after \n\ndosing. Paradoxical bronchospasm responds to a rapid-acting bronchodilator and should be treated \n\nstraightaway. Aerivio Spiromax should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative \n\ntherapy instituted if necessary. \n\n \n\nDue to the fluticasone propionate component, hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat \n\nand, rarely, of the oesophagus, can occur in some patients. Both hoarseness and incidence of mouth and \n\nthroat candidiasis may be relieved by rinsing the mouth with water and spitting the water out and/or brushing \n\nthe teeth after using the product. Symptomatic mouth and throat candidiasis can be treated with topical anti-\n\nfungal therapy whilst still continuing with Aerivio Spiromax. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years (see Section \n\n4.2). Possible systemic effects in these age groups include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal \n\nsuppression and growth retardation in children and adolescents (see section 4.4). Children may also \n\nexperience anxiety, sleep disorders and behavioural changes, including hyperactivity and irritability.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere are no data available from clinical trials on overdose with Aerivio Spiromax, however data on \n\noverdose with both active substances are given below: \n\n \n\nSalmeterol \n\nThe signs and symptoms of salmeterol overdose are dizziness, increases in systolic blood pressure, tremor, \n\nheadache and tachycardia. If Aerivio Spiromax therapy has to be withdrawn due to overdose of the β agonist \n\ncomponent of the medicinal product, provision of appropriate replacement steroid therapy should be \n\nconsidered. Additionally, hypokalaemia can occur and therefore serum potassium levels should be \n\nmonitored. Potassium replacement should be considered. \n\n \n\nFluticasone propionate  \n\nAcute: Acute inhalation of fluticasone propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to \n\ntemporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is \n\nrecovered in a few days, as verified by plasma cortisol measurements. \n\n \n\nChronic overdose: Adrenal reserve should be monitored and treatment with a systemic corticosteroid may be \n\nnecessary. When stabilised, treatment should be continued with an inhaled corticosteroid at the \n\nrecommended dose. See section 4.4: “Adrenal function”.  \n\n \n\nIn cases of both acute and chronic fluticasone propionate overdose Aerivio Spiromax therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a suitable dose for symptom control. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with \n\ncorticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics, ATC code: R03AK06 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n\nAerivio Spiromax contains salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, which have differing modes of action. \n\nThe respective mechanisms of action of both active substances are discussed below. \n\n \n\nSalmeterol: \n\nSalmeterol is a selective long-acting (12 hour) β2 adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain which binds to \n\nthe exo-site of the receptor. \n\nSalmeterol produces a longer duration of bronchodilation, lasting for at least 12 hours, than recommended \n\ndoses of conventional short-acting β2 agonists. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nFluticasone propionate: \n\nFluticasone propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory \n\naction within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, with less adverse effects \n\nthan when corticosteroids are administered systemically. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe studies described below (GOAL, TORCH and SMART) were carried out with this same fixed-dose \n\ncombination, salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate, but studied a previously authorised product; \n\nthe studies described were not carried out with Aerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nSalmeterol/Fluticasone propionate - Asthma clinical trials  \n\nA twelve month study (Gaining Optimal Asthma ControL, GOAL), in 3416 adult and adolescent patients \n\nwith persistent asthma, compared the safety and efficacy of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate versus inhaled \n\ncorticosteroid (fluticasone propionate) alone to determine whether the goals of asthma management were \n\nachievable. Treatment was stepped up every 12 weeks until **total control was achieved or the highest dose \n\nof study drug was reached. GOAL showed more patients treated with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate \n\nachieved asthma control than patients treated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) alone and this control was \n\nattained at a lower corticosteroid dose. \n\n \n\n*Well controlled asthma was achieved more rapidly with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate than with ICS \n\nalone. The time on treatment for 50% of subjects to achieve a first individual well controlled week was 16 \n\ndays for salmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared with 37 days for the ICS group. In the subset of steroid \n\nnaive asthmatics the time to an individual well controlled week was 16 days in the salmeterol/fluticasone \n\npropionate treatment compared with 23 days following treatment with ICS. \n\n \n\nThe overall study results showed: \n\n \n\nPercentage of Patients Attaining *Well Controlled (WC) and **Totally Controlled (TC) Asthma over \n\n12 months \n\n \n\nPre-Study Treatment  \n\nSalmeterol/FP FP \n\nWC TC WC TC \n\nNo ICS (SABA alone) 78% 50% 70% 40% \n\nLow dose ICS ( ≤500 micrograms BDP or \n\nequivalent/day) \n\n75% 44% 60% 28% \n\nMedium dose ICS (>500 to 1000 micrograms \n\nBDP or equivalent/day) \n\n62% 29% 47% 16% \n\nPooled results across the 3 treatment levels 71% 41% 59% 28% \n\n*Well controlled asthma - less than or equal to 2 days with symptom score greater than 1 (symptom score 1 \n\ndefined as ‘symptoms for one short period during the day’), SABA use on less than or equal to 2 days and \n\nless than or equal to 4 occasions/week, greater than or equal to 80% predicted morning peak expiratory flow, \n\nno night-time awakenings, no exacerbations and no side effects enforcing a change in therapy  \n\n**Total control of asthma - no symptoms, no SABA use, greater than or equal to 80% predicted morning \n\npeak expiratory flow, no night-time awakenings, no exacerbations and no side effects enforcing a change in \n\ntherapy \n\n \n\nThe results of this study suggest that salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/100 micrograms twice daily may \n\nbe considered as initial maintenance therapy in patients with moderate persistent asthma for whom rapid \n\ncontrol of asthma is deemed essential (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nA double blind, randomised, parallel group study in 318 patients with persistent asthma aged ≥18 years \n\nevaluated the safety and tolerability of administering two inhalations twice daily (double dose) of \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate for two weeks. The study showed that doubling the inhalations of each \n\nstrength of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate for up to 14 days resulted in a small increase in β agonist-\n\nrelated adverse events (tremor - 1 patient [1%] vs 0, palpitations - 6 [3%] vs 1 [<1%], muscle cramps –6 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\n[3%] vs 1 [<1%]) and a similar incidence of inhaled corticosteroid related adverse events (e.g. oral \n\ncandidiasis - 6 [6%] vs 16 [8%], hoarseness - 2 [2%] vs 4 [2%]) compared with one inhalation twice daily. \n\nThe small increase in β agonist-related adverse events should be taken into account if doubling the dose of \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate is considered by the physician in adult patients requiring additional short-\n\nterm (up to 14 days) inhaled corticosteroid therapy. \n\n \n\nSalmeterol/fluticasone propionate COPD - clinical trials \n\nTORCH was a 3-year study to assess the effect of treatment with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate \n\ninhalation powder 50/500 micrograms twice daily, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 micrograms twice daily, \n\nfluticasone propionate (FP) inhalation powder 500 micrograms twice daily or placebo on all-cause mortality \n\nin patients with COPD. COPD patients with a baseline (pre-bronchodilator) FEV1 <60% of predicted normal \n\nwere randomised to double-blind medication. During the study, patients were permitted usual COPD therapy \n\nwith the exception of other inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators and long-term systemic \n\ncorticosteroids.

Non-significant p value after adjustment for 2 interim analyses on the primary efficacy comparison from a \n\nlog-rank analysis stratified by smoking status \n\n \n\nThere was a trend towards improved survival in subjects treated with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate \n\ncompared with placebo over 3 years however this did not achieve the statistical significance level p≤0.05. \n\n \n\nThe percentage of patients who died within 3 years due to COPD-related causes was 6.0% for placebo, 6.1% \n\nfor salmeterol, 6.9% for FP and 4.7% for salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. \n\n \n\nThe mean number of moderate to severe exacerbations per year was significantly reduced with \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate (FP) as compared with treatment with salmeterol, FP and placebo (mean \n\nrate in the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate group 0.85 compared with 0.97 in the salmeterol group, 0.93 in \n\nthe FP group and 1.13 in the placebo). This translates to a reduction in the rate of moderate to severe \n\nexacerbations of 25% (95% CI: 19% to 31%; p<0.001) compared with placebo, 12% compared with \n\nsalmeterol (95% CI: 5% to 19%, p=0.002) and 9% compared with FP (95% CI: 1% to 16%, p=0.024). \n\nSalmeterol and FP significantly reduced exacerbation rates compared with placebo by 15% (95% CI: 7% to \n\n22%; p<0.001) and 18% (95% CI: 11% to 24%; p<0.001) respectively.  \n\n \n\nHealth Related Quality of Life, as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was \n\nimproved by all active treatments in comparison with placebo. The average improvement over three years for \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared with placebo was -3.1 units (95% CI: -4.1 to -2.1; p<0.001) and \n\nwhen compared with salmeterol was -2.2 units (p<0.001) and when compared with FP was -1.2 units \n\n(p=0.017).

There was no increase in \n\npneumonia related deaths; deaths while on treatment that were adjudicated as primarily due to pneumonia \n\nwere 7 for placebo, 9 for salmeterol, 13 for FP and 8 for salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. There was no \n\nsignificant difference in probability of bone fracture (5.1% placebo, 5.1% salmeterol, 5.4% FP and 6.3% \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate; hazard ratio for salmeterol/fluticasone propionate vs placebo: 1.22, 95% \n\nCI: 0.87 to 1.72, p=0.248.  \n\n \n\nPlacebo-controlled clinical trials, over 6 and 12 months, have shown that regular use of \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/500 micrograms improves lung function and reduces breathlessness and \n\nthe use of relief medication.  \n\n \n\nStudies SCO40043 and SCO100250 were randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, replicate studies \n\ncomparing the effect of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 micrograms twice daily (a dose not \n\nlicensed for COPD treatment in the European Union) with salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily, on the \n\nannual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in subjects with COPD with FEV1 less than 50% predicted and \n\na history of exacerbations. Moderate/ severe exacerbations were defined as worsening symptoms that \n\nrequired treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or in-patient hospitalisation. \n\n \n\nThe trials had a 4 week run-in period during which all subjects received open-label salmeterol/FP 50/250 to \n\nstandardize COPD pharmacotherapy and stabilise disease prior to randomisation to blinded study medication \n\nfor 52 weeks. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to salmeterol/FP 50/250 (total ITT n=776) or salmeterol (total \n\nITT n=778). Prior to run-in, subjects discontinued use of previous COPD medications except short-acting \n\nbronchodilators. The use of concurrent inhaled long-acting β2 agonists and anticholinergic drugs, \n\nsalbutamol/ipratropium bromide combination products, oral β2 agonists and theophylline preparations were \n\nnot allowed during the treatment period. Oral corticosteroids and antibiotics were allowed for the acute \n\ntreatment of COPD exacerbations with specific guidelines for use. Subjects used salbutamol on an as-needed \n\nbasis throughout the studies. \n\n \n\nThe results of both studies showed that treatment with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 resulted in a \n\nsignificantly lower annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with salmeterol \n\n(SCO40043: 1.06 and 1.53 per subject per year, respectively, rate ratio of 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.83, \n\np<0.001; SCO100250: 1.10 and 1.59 per subject per year, respectively, rate ratio of 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58 to \n\n0.83, p<0.001). Findings for the secondary efficacy measures (time to first moderate/severe exacerbation, the \n\nannual rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, and pre-dose morning (AM) FEV1) significantly \n\nfavoured salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 micrograms twice daily over salmeterol. Adverse event \n\nprofiles were similar with the exception of a higher incidence of pneumonias and known local side effects \n\n(candidiasis and dysphonia) in the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 micrograms twice daily group \n\ncompared with salmeterol. Pneumonia-related events were reported for 55 (7%) subjects in the \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 micrograms twice daily group and 25 (3%) in the salmeterol group. \n\nThe increased incidence of reported pneumonia with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 micrograms \n\ntwice daily appears to be of similar magnitude to the incidence reported following treatment with \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/500 micrograms twice daily in TORCH. \n\n \n\nThe Salmeterol Multi-center Asthma Research Trial (SMART)  \n\nSMART was a multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 28-week study in \n\nthe US which randomised 13,176 patients to salmeterol (50 micrograms twice daily) and 13,179 patients to \n\nplacebo in addition to the patients’ usual asthma therapy. Patients were enrolled if ≥12 years of age, with \n\nasthma and if currently using asthma medication (but not a LABA). Baseline ICS use at study entry was \n\nrecorded, but not required in the study.

The impact of optimal training (i.e. breathing in forcefully upon inhalation) in dry \n\npowder inhaler inhalation technique on inhalation speed and volume was assessed in these subject groups, \n\ntogether with assessment of potential differences in inhalation outputs according to the devices used.  \n\n \n\nThe data from the study indicated that regardless of age and underlying disease severity, children, \n\nadolescents and adults with asthma as well as patients with COPD were able to achieve inspiratory flow rates \n\nthrough the Spiromax device that were similar to those generated through the marketed multi-dose dry \n\npowder inhaler device. The mean PIFR achieved by patients with asthma or COPD with optimal training (i.e. \n\nforceful inhalation) was over 60 L/min, a flow rate at which both devices studied are known to deliver \n\ncomparable amounts of drug to the lungs.  \n\n \n\nAll subjects with asthma or COPD achieved PIFR values greater than 60L/min after optimal training. It is \n\nimportant to inhale forcefully to ensure optimal dosing. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nA  flow rate of greater than 60L/min is required for optimal delivery of drugs to the lungs through the multi-\n\ndose dry powder Spiromax inhaler.  \n\n \n\nIn order to ensure that patients achieve the PIFR needed to deliver the required dose, the patient is required to \n\nbe trained on the use of the Spiromax device including instruction on the need to inhale forcefully (see \n\nSection 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years. The \n\nsafety and efficacy of Aerivio Spiromax in this young population have not been established.  The data \n\npresented below refer to a lower dose of the fixed-dose combination containing these two actives, a dose and \n\nstrength which is not available for Aerivio Spiromax. The studies described were carried out with a \n\npreviously authorised product available in three different strengths; the studies were not carried out with \n\nAerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nIn a study  in 158 children aged 6 to 16 years with symptomatic asthma, the combination of salmeterol/ \n\nfluticasone propionate is as efficacious as doubling the dose of fluticasone propionate in respect of  symptom \n\ncontrol and lung function. This study was not designed to investigate the effect on exacerbations. \n\n \n\nIn a 12-week trial of children aged 4 to 11 years [n=257] treated with either salmeterol/fluticasone \n\npropionate 50/100 or salmeterol 50 micrograms + fluticasone propionate 100 micrograms both twice daily, \n\nboth treatment arms experienced a 14% increase in peak expiratory flow rate as well as improvements in \n\nsymptom score and rescue salbutamol use. There were no differences between the two treatment arms. There \n\nwere no differences in safety parameters between the two treatment arms. \n\n \n\nIn a 12-week trial of children 4 to 11 years of age [n=203] randomized in a parallel-group study with \n\npersistent asthma and who were symptomatic on inhaled corticosteroid, safety was the primary objective. \n\nChildren received either salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (50/100 micrograms) or fluticasone propionate \n\n(100 micrograms) alone twice daily. Two children on salmeterol/fluticasone propionate and 5 children on \n\nfluticasone propionate withdrew because of worsening asthma. After 12 weeks no children in either \n\ntreatment arm had abnormally low 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion. There were no other differences in \n\nsafety profile between the treatment arms. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFor pharmacokinetic purposes each component can be considered separately. \n\n \n\nSalmeterol \n\nSalmeterol acts locally in the lung therefore plasma levels are not an indication of therapeutic effects. In \n\naddition there are only limited data available on the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol because of the technical \n\ndifficulty of assaying the drug in plasma due to the low plasma concentrations at therapeutic doses \n\n(approximately 200 picogram/mL or less) achieved after inhaled dosing. \n\n \n\n \n\nFluticasone propionate \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of a single dose of inhaled fluticasone propionate in healthy subjects varies \n\nbetween approximately 5 to 11% of the nominal dose depending on the inhalation device used. In patients \n\nwith asthma or COPD a lesser degree of systemic exposure to inhaled fluticasone propionate has been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nSystemic absorption occurs mainly through the lungs and is initially rapid then prolonged. The remainder of \n\nthe inhaled dose of fluticasone propionate may be swallowed but contributes minimally to systemic exposure \n\ndue to the low aqueous solubility and presystemic metabolism, resulting in oral availability of less than 1%. \n\nThere is a linear increase in systemic exposure with increasing inhaled dose. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe disposition of fluticasone propionate is characterised by high plasma clearance (1150 mL/min), a large \n\nvolume of distribution at steady-state (approximately 300 L) and a terminal half-life of approximately 8 \n\nhours. Plasma protein binding is 91%.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nFluticasone propionate is cleared very rapidly from the systemic circulation. The main pathway is \n\nmetabolism to an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Other \n\nunidentified metabolites are also found in the faeces.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe renal clearance of fluticasone propionate is negligible. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted in urine, \n\nmainly as metabolites. The main part of the dose is excreted in faeces as metabolites and unchanged drug. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years. The \n\nsafety and efficacy of Aerivio Spiromax in this young population have not been established.  The data \n\npresented below refer to a lower dose of the fixed-dose combination containing these two actives, a dose and \n\nstrength which is not available for Aerivio Spiromax. \n\n \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis from 9 controlled clinical trials of 350 patients with asthma aged 4 \n\nto 77 years (174 patients 4 to 11 years of age) higher fluticasone propionate systemic exposure following \n\ntreatment with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 50/100 compared with fluticasone \n\npropionate inhalation powder 100 was seen. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nThe only safety concerns for human use derived from animal studies of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate \n\ngiven separately were effects associated with exaggerated pharmacological actions. \n\n \n\nIn animal reproduction studies, glucocorticosteroids have been shown to induce malformations (cleft palate, \n\nskeletal malformations). However, these animal experimental results do not seem to be relevant for man \n\ngiven recommended doses. Animal studies with salmeterol have shown embryofetal toxicity only at high \n\nexposure levels. Following co-administration, increased incidences of transposed umbilical artery and \n\nincomplete ossification of occipital bone were found in rats at doses associated with known glucocorticoid-\n\ninduced abnormalities. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Aerivio Spiromax is and what it is used for \n\n \nAerivio Spiromax contains two medicines, salmeterol and fluticasone propionate: \n \n\n Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators help the airways in the lungs to stay open. \nThis makes it easier for air to get in and out. The effects last for at least 12 hours. \n\n Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid which reduces swelling and irritation in the lungs. \n \n\n \n\nYour doctor has prescribed this medicine for the treatment of either \n\n Severe asthma, to help prevent attacks of breathlessness and wheeziness,  \nor \n\n Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to reduce the number of flare ups of symptoms. \n \n\nYou must use Aerivio Spiromax every day as directed by your doctor. This will make sure that it works \n\nproperly in controlling your asthma or COPD. \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax helps to stop breathlessness and wheeziness coming on. However, Aerivio Spiromax \n\nshould not be used to relieve an attack of breathlessness or wheezing. If this happens you need to use a \n\nfast-acting ‘reliever’ (‘rescue’) inhaler, such as salbutamol. You should always have your fast-acting \n\n'rescue' inhaler with you. \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax should only be used to treat severe asthma in adults aged 18 years and older and \n\nadults with COPD.  \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Aerivio Spiromax  \n\n \n\nDo not use Aerivio Spiromax: \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to salmeterol, fluticasone propionate or any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aerivio Spiromax if you have: \n\n Heart disease, including an irregular or fast heart beat \n\n Overactive thyroid gland \n\n High blood pressure \n\n Diabetes mellitus (Aerivio Spiromax may increase your blood sugar) \n\n Low potassium in your blood  \n\n Tuberculosis (TB) now or have had in the past, or have other lung infections \n \n\nContact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents under the age of 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Aerivio Spiromax \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or, have recently taken or might use any other medicines. \n\nThis includes other medicines for asthma or any medicines obtained without a prescription. Aerivio \n\nSpiromax may not be suitable to be taken with some other medicines.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines, before starting to use Aerivio Spiromax: \n\n Beta blockers (such as atenolol, propranolol and sotalol). Beta blockers are mostly used for high blood \npressure or heart conditions such as angina. \n\n Medicines to treat infections (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole and erythromycin). Some of \nthese medicines may increase the amount of salmeterol or fluticasone propionate in your body. This can \n\nincrease your risk of side effects with Aerivio Spiromax, including irregular heartbeats, or may make \n\nside effects worse. \n\n Corticosteroids (by mouth or by injection). Recent use of these medicines might increase the risk of \nAerivio Spiromax affecting your adrenal glands. \n\n Diuretics, also known as ‘water tablets’ used to treat high blood pressure.  \n\n Other bronchodilators (such as salbutamol).  \n\n Xanthine medicines such as aminophylline and theophylline. These are often used to treat asthma. \n \n\nSome medicines may increase the effects of Aerivio Spiromax and your doctor may wish to monitor you \n\ncarefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether this medicine can pass into breast milk. If you are breastfeeding, check with your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist  for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nAerivio Spiromax is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nAerivio Spiromax contains lactose \n\nLactose is a type of sugar found in milk. Lactose contains small amounts of milk protein which may cause \n\nallergic reactions. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance or allergy to lactose, \n\nother sugars, or milk, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Aerivio Spiromax \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n Use your Aerivio Spiromax every day until your doctor advises you to stop. Do not take more than the \nrecommended dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\n Do not stop taking Aerivio Spiromax or reduce the dose of Aerivio Spiromax without talking to your \ndoctor first. \n\n Aerivio Spiromax should be inhaled through the mouth into the lungs. \n \n\nThe recommended dose is: \n\n \n\nSevere asthma in adults 18 years of age and older \n\n \n\nOne inhalation twice a day \n\n \n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) \n\n \n\nOne inhalation twice a day \n\n \n\nIf you are using Aerivio Spiromax for asthma, your doctor will want to check your symptoms regularly. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will help you to manage your asthma and will adjust the dose of this medicine to the lowest dose \n\nthat controls your asthma. If your doctor feels that you need a lower dose than is available from your Aerivio \n\nSpiromax, your doctor may prescribe an alternative inhaler containing the same active substances as your \n\nAerivio Spiromax but with a lower dose of the corticosteroid. However, do not change the number of \n\ninhalations your doctor has prescribed without talking to your doctor first. \n\n \n\nIf your asthma or breathing gets worse tell your doctor straight away. If you feel more wheezy, your \n\nchest feels tight more often or you need to use more of your fast-acting ‘reliever’ medicine, your chest \n\ncondition may be getting worse and you could become seriously ill. You should continue to take Aerivio \n\nSpiromax but do not increase the number of puffs you take.  See your doctor at once as you may need \n\nadditional treatment. \n\n \n\nInstructions for use \n\n \n\nTraining \n\nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist should provide you with training on how to use your inhaler, \n\nincluding how to take a dose effectively. This training is important to ensure you receive the dose you \n\nrequire. If you have not received this training please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to show you \n\nhow to use your inhaler properly before you use it for the first time.   \n\n \n\nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist should also check how you use your Spiromax device from time to time to \n\nensure that you are using the device properly and as prescribed. If you are not using Aerivio Spiromax \n\nproperly and/or you are not breathing in forcefully enough, this may mean that you are not getting enough of \n\nthe medicine into your lungs.  If you are not getting enough medicine into your lungs, it will not help your \n\nasthma or COPD as it should \n\n \n\nPreparing your Aerivio Spiromax  \n\n \n\nBefore using your Aerivio Spiromax for the first time, you need to prepare it for use as follows: \n\n Check the dose indicator to see that there are 60 inhalations in the inhaler. \n\n Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label on the inhaler. \n\n You do not need to shake your inhaler before you use it. \n \n\n \n\nHow to take an inhalation \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover at the bottom. You do not need to \nshake your inhaler. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2. Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until you hear one loud click. Your inhaler is now ready \nfor use. \n\n \n  \n\n3. Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. \n4. Place the mouthpiece between your teeth. Do not bite the mouthpiece. Close your lips around the \n\nmouthpiece. Take care not to block the air vents. \n\n Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as forcefully as you can.  \n\n Note that it is important that you breathe in forcefully. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\n  \n \n\n5. Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. \n \n\n6. Remove your inhaler from your mouth. You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7. Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler). Close the mouthpiece cover.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAfterwards, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out and/or brush your teeth. This may help to stop you \n\ngetting thrush in your mouth and/or becoming hoarse. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nDo not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover. The mouthpiece cover is fixed to \n\nyour inhaler and must not be taken off. Do not use your inhaler if it is damaged or if the mouthpiece has \n\ncome apart from your inhaler. Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to use your \n\ninhaler.  \n\n \n\nIf you open and close the mouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose will be securely held inside the \n\ninhaler ready for the next inhalation. It is impossible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in \n\none inhalation. \n\n \n\nKeep the mouthpiece closed all the time unless you are about to use your inhaler. \n\n \n\nCleaning your Inhaler \n\nKeep your inhaler dry and clean. \n\nIf necessary you may wipe the mouthpiece of your inhaler after use with a dry cloth or tissue. \n\n \n\nWhen to start using a new Aerivio Spiromax \n\n The dose indicator on the rear of the device tells you how many doses (inhalations) are left in your \ninhaler, starting with 60 inhalations when it is full.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n The dose indicator shows the number of inhalations remaining in even numbers only. \n\n For inhalations remaining from 20 downwards to ‘8’, ‘6’, ‘4’, ‘2’ the numbers are displayed in red on a \nwhite background. When the numbers become red in the window, you should see your doctor and get a \n\nnew inhaler. \n\n \n\n \n\nNote:  \n\n The mouthpiece will still ‘click’ even when your inhaler is empty. If you open and close the \nmouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose indicator will still register it as a count.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Aerivio Spiromax than you should \nIt is important to use the inhaler as instructed. If you accidentally take more doses than is recommended, talk \n\nto your doctor or pharmacist. You may notice your heart beating faster than usual and that you feel shaky. \n\nYou may also have dizziness, a headache, muscle weakness and aching joints. \n\n \n\nIf you have used too many doses of Aerivio Spiromax for a long time, you should talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist for advice. This is because using too much Aerivio Spiromax may reduce the amount of steroid \n\nhormones produced by your adrenal glands.  \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Aerivio Spiromax \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take your next dose at the usual time. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\nIf you stop using Aerivio Spiromax \n\nIt is very important that you take your Aerivio Spiromax every day as directed. Keep taking it until your \n\ndoctor tells you to stop. Do not stop or suddenly reduce your dose of Aerivio Spiromax. This could \n\nmake your breathing worse. \n\n \n\nIn addition, if you suddenly stop taking Aerivio Spiromax or reduce your dose of Aerivio Spiromax this may \n\n(very rarely) cause you to have problems with your adrenal glands (adrenal insufficiency) which sometimes \n\ncauses side effects. \n\n \n\nThese side effects may include any of the following: \n\n \n\n Stomach pain \n\n Tiredness and loss of appetite, feeling sick \n\n Sickness and diarrhoea \n\n Weight loss \n\n Headache or drowsiness \n\n Low levels of sugar in your blood \n\n Low blood pressure and seizures (fits) \nWhen your body is under stress such as from fever, trauma (such as an accident or injury), infection, or \n\nsurgery, adrenal insufficiency can get worse and you may have any of the side effects listed above. \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. To prevent these symptoms, your doctor may \n\nprescribe extra corticosteroids in tablet form (such as prednisolone). \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. To reduce the \n\nchance of side effects your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose of this combination of drugs to control your \n\nasthma or COPD. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions: you may notice your breathing suddenly gets worse immediately after using Aerivio \n\nSpiromax. You may be very wheezy and cough or be short of breath. You may also notice itching, a rash \n\n(hives) and swelling (usually of the face, lips, tongue or throat), or you may suddenly feel that your heart is \n\nbeating very fast or you feel faint and light headed (which may lead to collapse or loss of consciousness). If \n\nyou get any of these effects or if they happen suddenly after using Aerivio Spiromax, stop using \n\nAerivio Spiromax and tell your doctor straight away. Allergic reactions to Aerivio Spiromax are \n\nuncommon (they may affect up to 1 in 100 people).  \n\nOther side effects are listed below: \n\n \n\n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n Headache - this usually gets better as treatment continues. \n\n Increased number of colds have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD). \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Thrush (sore, creamy-yellow, raised patches) in the mouth and throat. Also sore tongue and hoarse voice \nand throat irritation. Rinsing your mouth out with water and spitting it out immediately and/or brushing \n\nyour teeth after taking each dose of your medicine may help. Your doctor may prescribe an anti-fungal \n\nmedicine to treat the thrush. \n\n Aching, swollen joints and muscle pain. \n\n Muscle cramps. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have also been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n\n(COPD): \n\n Pneumonia and bronchitis (lung infection). Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms \nwhile taking Aerivio Spiromax as they could be symptoms of a lung infection: fever or chills; increased \n\nmucus production, changes in mucus colour; increased cough or increased breathing difficulties. \n\n Bruising and fractures. \n\n Inflammation of sinuses (sinusitis, a feeling of tension or fullness in the nose, cheeks and behind the \neyes, sometimes with a throbbing ache). \n\n A reduction in the amount of potassium in the blood (you may get an uneven heartbeat, muscle \nweakness, cramp). \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Increases in the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood (hyperglycaemia). If you have diabetes, more \nfrequent blood sugar monitoring and possibly adjustment of your usual diabetic treatment may be \n\nrequired. \n\n Cataract (cloudy lens in the eye). \n\n Very fast heart beat (tachycardia). \n\n Feeling shaky (tremor) and fast or uneven heart beat (palpitations) - these are usually harmless and get \nless as treatment continues. \n\n Chest pain. \n\n Feeling worried (although this effect occurs mainly in children when prescribed this combination of \ndrugs but in a lower strength). \n\n Disturbed sleep. \n\n Allergic skin rash. \n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n Breathing difficulties or wheezing that gets worse straight after taking Aerivio Spiromax. If this \nhappens stop using your Aerivio Spiromax inhaler. Use your fast acting ‘reliever’ inhaler to help your \n\nbreathing and tell your doctor straight away. \n\n Aerivio Spiromax may affect the normal production of steroid hormones in the body, particularly if you \nhave taken high doses for long periods of time. The effects include: \n\n Slowing of growth in children and adolescents \n\n Thinning of the bones \n\n Glaucoma \n\n Weight gain \n\n Rounded (moon shaped) face (Cushing’s syndrome) \n \n\nYour doctor will check you regularly for any of these side effects and make sure you are taking the \n\nlowest dose of this combination of drugs to control your asthma. \n\n \n\n Behavioural changes, such as being unusually active and irritable (although these effects occur mainly in \nchildren when prescribed this combination of drugs but in a lower strength). \n\n Uneven or irregular heart beat or an extra heart beat (arrhythmias). Tell your doctor, but do not stop \ntaking Aerivio Spiromax unless the doctor tells you to stop. \n\n A fungal infection in the oesophagus (food canal), which might cause difficulties in swallowing. \n \n\n \n\nFrequency not known, but may also occur: \n\n Depression or aggression (although these effects are more likely to occur in children when prescribed \nthis combination of drugs but in a lower strength). \n\n Blurred vision \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
