NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nXenical 120 mg hard capsules \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains 120 mg orlistat. \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.  \n\nThe capsule has a turquoise cap and turquoise body bearing the imprint of \u201cXENICAL 120\u201d. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nXenical is indicated in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet for the treatment of obese patients \n\nwith a body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 30 kg/m\u00b2, or overweight patients (BMI > 28 kg/m\u00b2) \n\nwith associated risk factors. \n\nTreatment with orlistat should be discontinued after 12 weeks if patients have been unable to lose at \n\nleast 5 % of the body weight as measured at the start of therapy. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nAdults  \n\nThe recommended dose of orlistat is one 120 mg capsule taken with water immediately before, during \n\nor up to one hour after each main meal. If a meal is missed or contains no fat, the dose of orlistat \n\nshould be omitted.  \n\nThe patient should be on a nutritionally balanced, mildly hypocaloric diet that contains approximately \n\n30 % of calories from fat. It is recommended that the diet should be rich in fruit and vegetables. The \n\ndaily intake of fat, carbohydrate and protein should be distributed over three main meals. \n\nDoses of orlistat above 120 mg three times daily have not been shown to provide additional benefit. \n\nThe effect of orlistat results in an increase in faecal fat as early as 24 to 48 hours after dosing. Upon \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy, faecal fat content usually returns to pre-treatment levels, within 48 to 72 \n\nhours. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nThe effect of orlistat in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment, children and elderly patients has \n\nnot been studied.  \n\nThere is no relevant indication for use of Xenical in children. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\n\n- Chronic malabsorption syndrome.\n\n- Cholestasis.\n\n- Breast-feeding.\n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nIn clinical trials, the decrease in bodyweight with orlistat treatment was less in type II diabetic patients \n\nthan in non-diabetic patients. Antidiabetic medicinal product treatment may have to be closely \n\nmonitored when taking orlistat. \n\nCo-administration of orlistat with ciclosporin is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients should be advised to adhere to the dietary recommendations they are given (see section 4.2). \n\nThe possibility of experiencing gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section 4.8) may increase when \n\norlistat is taken with a diet high in fat (e.g. in a 2000 kcal/day diet, > 30 % of calories from fat equates \n\nto > 67 g of fat). The daily intake of fat should be distributed over three main meals. If orlistat is taken \n\nwith a meal very high in fat, the possibility of gastrointestinal adverse reactions may increase.  \n\nCases of rectal bleeding have been reported with Xenical. Prescribers should investigate further in \n\ncase of severe and/or persistent symptoms. \n\nThe use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral \n\ncontraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5). \n\nCoagulation parameters should be monitored in patients treated with concomitant oral anticoagulants \n\n(see section 4.5 and 4.8). \n\nThe use of orlistat may be associated with hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy leading sometimes \n\nto renal failure. This risk is increased in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease and/or \n\nvolume depletion (see section 4.8). \n\nRare occurrence of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur. The \n\nmechanism, although not proven, may involve a decreased absorption of iodine salts and/or \n\nlevothyroxine (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiepileptics patient: Orlistat may unbalance anticonvulsivant treatment by decreasing the absorption \n\nof antiepileptic drugs, leading to convulsions (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiretrovirals for HIV: Orlistat may potentially reduce the absorption of antiretroviral medicines for \n\nHIV and could negatively affect the efficacy of antiretroviral medications for HIV (see section 4.5). \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nCiclosporin \n\nA decrease in ciclosporin plasma levels has been observed in a drug-drug-interaction study and also \n\nreported in several cases, when orlistat was administered concomitantly. This can lead to a decrease of \n\nimmunosuppressive efficacy. Therefore the combination is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\nHowever, if such concomitant use is unavoidable, more frequent monitoring of ciclosporin blood \n\nlevels should be performed both after addition of orlistat and upon discontinuation of orlistat in \n\nciclosporin treated patients. Ciclosporin blood levels should be monitored until stabilised. \n\nAcarbose  \n\nIn the absence of pharmacokinetic interaction studies, the concomitant administration of orlistat with \n\nacarbose should be avoided.  \n\nOral anticoagulants \n\n\n\n4 \n\nWhen warfarin or other anticoagulants are given in combination with orlistat, international normalised \n\nratio (INR) values should be monitored (see section 4.4). \n\nFat soluble vitamins \n\nTreatment with orlistat may potentially impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). \n\nThe vast majority of patients receiving up to four full years of treatment with orlistat in clinical studies \n\nhad vitamin A, D, E and K and beta-carotene levels that stayed within normal range. In order to ensure \n\nadequate nutrition, patients on a weight control diet should be advised to have a diet rich in fruit and \n\nvegetables and use of a multivitamin supplement could be considered. If a multivitamin supplement is \n\nrecommended, it should be taken at least two hours after the administration of orlistat or at bedtime. \n\nAmiodarone  \n\nA slight decrease in plasma levels of amiodarone, when given as a single dose, has been observed in a \n\nlimited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly. In patients receiving \n\namiodarone treatment, the clinical relevance of this effect remains unknown but may become \n\nclinically relevant in some cases. In patients receiving concomitant amiodarone treatment, \n\nreinforcement of clinical and ECG monitoring is warranted. \n\nConvulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic drugs \n\ne.g. valproate, lamotrigine, for which a causal relationship to an interaction cannot be excluded.\n\nTherefore, these patients should be monitored for possible changes in the frequency and/or severity of\n\nconvulsions.\n\nRare occurrence of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur. The \n\nmechanism, although not proven, may involve a decreased absorption of iodine salts and/or \n\nlevothyroxine (see section 4.4). \n\nThere are some case reports of reduced efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines, antidepressants \n\nantipsychotics (including lithium) and benzodiazepines coincidental to the initiation of orlistat \n\ntreatment in previously well-controlled patients.  Therefore orlistat treatment should only be initiated \n\nafter careful consideration of the possible impact in these patients. \n\nLack of interactions \n\nNo interactions with amitriptyline, atorvastatin, biguanides, digoxin, fibrates, fluoxetine, losartan, \n\nphenytoin, phentermine, pravastatin, nifedipine Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System (GITS), \n\nnifedipine slow release, sibutramine or alcohol have been observed. The absence of these interactions \n\nhas been demonstrated in specific drug-drug-interaction studies. \n\nThe absence of an interaction between oral contraceptives and orlistat has been demonstrated in \n\nspecific drug-drug interaction studies. However, orlistat may indirectly reduce the availability of oral \n\ncontraceptives and lead to unexpected pregnancies in some individual cases. An additional \n\ncontraceptive method is recommended in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.4). \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nFor orlistat no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \n\nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\nAs it is not known whether orlistat is secreted into human milk, orlistat is contra-indicated during \n\nbreast-feeding. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nXenical has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions to orlistat are largely gastrointestinal in nature. The incidence of adverse events \n\ndecreased with prolonged use of orlistat.  \n\n \n\nAdverse events are listed below by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as: \n\nvery common (\uf0b31/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 \n\nto <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000) including isolated reports.   \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nThe following table of undesirable effects (first year of treatment) is based on adverse events that \n\noccurred at a frequency of > 2 % and with an incidence \uf0b3 1 % above placebo in clinical trials of 1 and \n\n2 years duration: \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction/event \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common: Headache \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nVery common: \n\nCommon: \n\nUpper respiratory infection \n\nLower respiratory infection \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common: \n\nCommon: \n\nAbdominal pain/discomfort \n\nOily spotting from the rectum \n\nFlatus with discharge \n\nFaecal urgency \n\nFatty/oily stool \n\nFlatulence \n\nLiquid stools \n\nOily evacuation \n\nIncreased defecation \n\nRectal pain/discomfort \n\nSoft stools \n\nFaecal incontinence \n\nAbdominal distension* \n\nTooth disorder \n\nGingival disorder \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nCommon: Urinary tract infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common: Hypoglycemia* \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common: Influenza \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\nCommon: Fatigue \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nCommon: Menstrual irregularity \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nCommon: Anxiety \n\n* only unique treatment adverse events that occurred at a frequency of > 2 % and with an incidence\n\n\uf0b3 1 % above placebo in obese type 2 diabetic patients.\n\nIn a 4 year clinical trial, the general pattern of adverse event distribution was similar to that reported \n\nfor the 1 and 2 year studies with the total incidence of gastrointestinal related adverse events occurring \n\nin year 1 decreasing year on year over the four year period. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe following table of undesirable effects is based on post-marketing spontaneous reports, and \n\ntherefore the frequency remains unknown: \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction \n\nInvestigations \n\nIncrease in liver transaminases and in alkaline  \n\nphosphatase.  \n\nDecreased prothrombin, increased INR and  \n\nunbalanced anticoagulant treatment resulting in  \n\nvariations of haemostatic parameters have been  \n\nreported in patients treated with anticoagulants in \n\nassociation with orlistat (see section 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Rectal bleeding \n\nDiverticulitis  \n\nPancreatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nBullous eruptions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity (e.g. pruritus, rash, urticaria, \n\nangioedema, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis)  \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCholelithiasis  \n\nHepatitis that may be serious. Some fatal cases or \n\ncases requiring liver transplantation have been \n\nreported. \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Oxalate nephropathy that may lead to renal failure \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V*. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSingle doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily for 15 days have \n\nbeen studied in normal weight and obese subjects without significant adverse findings. In addition, \n\ndoses of 240 mg tid have been administered to obese patients for 6 months. The majority of orlistat \n\noverdose cases received during post-marketing reported either no adverse events or adverse events that \n\nare similar to those reported with recommended dose. \n\nShould a significant overdose of orlistat occur, it is recommended that the patient be observed for 24 \n\nhours. Based on human and animal studies, any systemic effects attributable to the lipase-inhibiting \n\nproperties of orlistat should be rapidly reversible. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Peripherally acting antiobesity agent, ATC code A08AB01. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nOrlistat is a potent, specific and long-acting inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases. It exerts its therapeutic \n\nactivity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active \n\nserine site of the gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzyme is thus unavailable to \n\nhydrolyse dietary fat, in the form of triglycerides, into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. \n\nIn the 2-year studies and the 4-year study, a hypocaloric diet was used in association with treatment in \n\nboth the orlistat and the placebo treated groups. \n\nPooled data from five 2 year studies with orlistat and a hypocaloric diet showed that 37 % of orlistat \n\npatients and 19 % of placebo patients demonstrated a loss of at least 5 % of their baseline body weight \n\nafter 12 weeks of treatment. Of these, 49 % of orlistat treated patients and 40 % of placebo treated \n\npatients went on to lose \u2265 10 % of their baseline body weight at one year. Conversely, of patients \n\nfailing to demonstrate a loss of 5 % of their baseline body weight after 12 weeks of treatment, only \n\n5 % of orlistat treated patients and 2 % of placebo treated patients went on to lose \u2265 10 % of their \n\nbaseline body weight at one year. Overall, after one year of treatment, the percentage of patients \n\ntaking 120 mg orlistat who lost 10 % or more of their body weight was 20 % with orlistat 120 mg \n\ncompared to 8 % of patients taking placebo. The mean difference in weight loss with the drug \n\ncompared to placebo was 3.2 kg.  \n\nData from the 4-year XENDOS clinical trial showed that 60 % of orlistat patients and 35 % of placebo \n\npatients demonstrated a loss of at least 5 % of their baseline body weight after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\nOf these, 62 % of orlistat treated patients and 52 % of placebo treated patients went on to lose \u2265 10 % \n\nof their baseline body weight at one year. Conversely, of patients failing to demonstrate a loss of 5 % \n\nof their baseline body weight after 12 weeks of treatment, only 5 % of orlistat treated patients and 4 % \n\nof placebo treated patients went on to lose \u2265 10 % of their baseline body weight at one year. After \n\n1 year of treatment, 41 % of the orlistat treated patients versus 21 % of placebo treated patients lost \n\n\uf0b3 10 % of body weight with a mean difference of 4.4 kg between the two groups. After 4 years of \n\ntreatment 21 % of the orlistat treated patients compared to 10 % of the placebo treated patients had lost \n\n\uf0b3 10 % of body weight, with a mean difference of 2.7 kg.  \n\nMore patients on orlistat or placebo lost baseline body weight of at least 5 % at 12 weeks or 10 % at \n\none year in the XENDOS study than in the five 2-year studies. The reason for this difference is that the \n\nfive 2-year studies included a 4-week diet and placebo lead-in period during which patients lost on \n\naverage 2.6 kg prior to commencing treatment. \n\nData from the 4-year clinical trial also suggested that weight loss achieved with orlistat delayed the \n\ndevelopment of type 2 diabetes during the study (cumulative diabetes cases incidences: 3.4 % in the \n\norlistat group compared to 5.4 % in the placebo-treated group). The great majority of diabetes cases \n\ncame from the subgroup of patients with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, which represented \n\n21 % of the randomised patients. It is not known whether these findings translate into long-term \n\nclinical benefits. \n\nIn obese type 2 diabetic patients insufficiently controlled by antidiabetic agents, data from four one-\n\nyear clinical trials showed that the percentage of responders (\uf0b3 10 % of body weight loss) was 11.3 % \n\nwith orlistat as compared to 4.5 % with placebo. In orlistat-treated patients, the mean difference from \n\nplacebo in weight loss was 1.83 kg to 3.06 kg and the mean difference from placebo in HbA1c \n\nreduction was 0.18 % to 0.55 %. It has not been demonstrated that the effect on HbA1c is independent \n\nfrom weight reduction.  \n\nIn a multi-centre (US, Canada), parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 539 obese \n\nadolescent patients were randomised to receive either 120 mg orlistat (n=357) or placebo (n=182) \n\nthree times daily as an adjunct to a hypocaloric diet and exercise for 52 weeks. Both populations \n\nreceived multivitamin supplements. The primary endpoint was the change in body mass index (BMI) \n\nfrom baseline to the end of the study. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nThe results were significantly superior in the orlistat group (difference in BMI of 0.86 kg/m2 in favour \n\nof orlistat). 9.5 % of the orlistat treated patients versus 3.3 % of the placebo treated patients lost \n\n\u2265 10 % of body weight after 1 year with a mean difference of 2.6 kg between the two groups. The \n\ndifference was driven by the outcome in the group of patients with \u2265 5 % weight loss after 12 weeks of \n\ntreatment with orlistat representing 19 % of the initial population. The side effects were generally \n\nsimilar to those observed in adults. However, there was an unexplained increase in the incidence of \n\nbone fractures (6 % versus 2.8 % in the orlistat and placebo groups, respectively). \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \n\nStudies in normal weight and obese volunteers have shown that the extent of absorption of orlistat was \n\nminimal. Plasma concentrations of intact orlistat were non-measurable (< 5 ng/ml) eight hours \n\nfollowing oral administration of orlistat. \n\nIn general, at therapeutic doses, detection of intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations \n\nwere extremely low (< 10 ng/ml or 0.02 \u00b5mol), with no evidence of accumulation, which is consistent \n\nwith minimal absorption. \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution cannot be determined because the drug is minimally absorbed and has no \n\ndefined systemic pharmacokinetics. In vitro orlistat is > 99 % bound to plasma proteins (lipoproteins \n\nand albumin were the major binding proteins). Orlistat minimally partitions into erythrocytes. \n\nMetabolism \n\nBased on animal data, it is likely that the metabolism of orlistat occurs mainly within the \n\ngastrointestinal wall. Based on a study in obese patients, of the minimal fraction of the dose that was \n\nabsorbed systemically, two major metabolites, M1 (4-member lactone ring hydrolysed) and M3 (M1 \n\nwith N-formyl leucine moiety cleaved), accounted for approximately 42 % of the total plasma \n\nconcentration.  \n\nM1 and M3 have an open beta-lactone ring and extremely weak lipase inhibitory activity (1000 and \n\n2500 fold less than orlistat respectively). In view of this low inhibitory activity and the low plasma \n\nlevels at therapeutic doses (average of 26 ng/ml and 108 ng/ml respectively), these metabolites are \n\nconsidered to be pharmacologically inconsequential. \n\nElimination \n\nStudies in normal weight and obese subjects have shown that faecal excretion of the unabsorbed drug \n\nwas the major route of elimination. Approximately 97 % of the administered dose was excreted in \n\nfaeces and 83 % of that as unchanged orlistat. \n\nThe cumulative renal excretion of total orlistat-related materials was < 2 % of the given dose. The time \n\nto reach complete excretion (faecal plus urinary) was 3 to 5 days. The disposition of orlistat appeared \n\nto be similar between normal weight and obese volunteers. Orlistat, M1 and M3 are all subject to \n\nbiliary excretion. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \n\nreproduction. \n\nIn animal reproductive studies, no teratogenic effect was observed. In the absence of a teratogenic \n\neffect in animals, no malformative effect is expected in man. To date, active substances responsible for \n\nmalformations in man have been found teratogenic in animals when well-conducted studies were \n\nperformed in two species. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n\n\u2022 If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or your pharmacist.\n\n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,\n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\n\u2022 If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Xenical is and what it is used for\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Xenical\n\n3. How to take Xenical\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\n5. How to store Xenical\n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What XENICAL is and what it is used for\n\nXenical is a medicine used to treat obesity. It works in your digestive system to block about one-third \n\nof the fat in the food you eat from being digested.  \n\nXenical attaches to the enzymes in your digestive system (lipases) and blocks them from breaking \n\ndown some of the fat you have eaten during your meal. The undigested fat cannot be absorbed and is \n\neliminated by your body. \n\nXenical is indicated in the treatment of obesity in conjunction with a low calorie intake diet. \n\n2. What you need to know before you take XENICAL\n\nDo not take XENICAL \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to orlistat or to any of the other ingredients of Xenical,\n\n\u2022 if you have chronic malabsorption syndrome (insufficient absorption of nutrients from\n\nalimentary tract),\n\n\u2022 if you have cholestasis (liver disorder)\n\n\u2022 if you are breast-feeding\n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nWeight loss may also affect the dose of medicines taken for other conditions (e.g. high cholesterol or \n\ndiabetes). Be sure to discuss these and other medicines you may be taking with your doctor. Losing \n\nweight may mean you need adjustments to the dose of these medicines. \n\nTo gain the maximum benefit from Xenical you should follow the nutrition program recommended to \n\nyou by your doctor. As with any weight-control program, over-consumption of fat and calories may \n\nreduce any weight loss effect.  \n\nThis medicine can cause harmless changes in your bowel habits, such as fatty or oily stools, due to the \n\nelimination of undigested fat in your faeces. The possibility of this happening may increase if Xenical \n\nis taken with a diet high in fat. In addition your daily intake of fat should be distributed evenly over \n\nthree main meals because if Xenical is taken with a meal very high in fat, the possibility of \n\ngastrointestinal effects may increase. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nThe use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral \n\ncontraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea. \n\nThe use of orlistat may be associated with renal stones in patients suffering from chronic kidney \n\ndisease. Inform your doctor whether you suffer from problems with your kidney. \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\nChildren \n\nXenical is not intended to be used in children. \n\nOther medicines and Xenical \n\nPlease inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\neven those not prescribed. \n\nThis is important as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the \n\neffects of the medicines. \n\nXenical may modify the activity of \n\n\u2022 Anticoagulant drugs (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor may need to monitor your blood coagulation.\n\n\u2022 Ciclosporin. Co-administration with ciclosporin is not recommended. Your doctor may need to\n\nmonitor your ciclosporin blood levels more frequently than usual.\n\n\u2022 Iodine salts and/or levothyroxine. Cases of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of\n\nhypothyroidism may occur.\n\n\u2022 Amiodarone. You may ask your doctor for advice.\n\n\u2022 Medicines to treat HIV.\n\n\u2022 Medicines for depression, psychiatric disorders or anxiousness\n\nXenical reduces the absorption of supplements of some fat soluble nutrients, particularly beta-carotene \n\nand vitamin E. You should therefore follow your doctor\u2019s advice in taking a well balanced diet rich in \n\nfruit and vegetables. Your doctor may suggest you take a multivitamin supplement. \n\nOrlistat may unbalance an anticonvulsivant treatment, by decreasing the absorption of antiepileptic \n\ndrugs, thus leading to convulsions. Please contact your doctor if you think that the frequency and/or \n\nseverity of the convulsions have changed when taking Xenical together with antiepileptic drugs. \n\nXenical is not recommended for people taking acarbose (an anti-diabetic drug used to treat type 2 \n\ndiabetes mellitus). \n\nXenical with food and drink \n\nXenical can be taken immediately before, during a meal or up to one hour after a meal. The capsule \n\nshould be swallowed with water. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nTaking Xenical during pregnancy is not recommended. \n\nYou must not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Xenical as it is not known whether Xenical \n\npasses into human milk. \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n\n\n24 \n\nXenical has no known effect on your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. \n\n3. How to take XENICAL\n\nAlways take Xenical exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. The usual dose of Xenical is one 120 mg capsule taken with each of the \n\nthree main meals per day. It can be taken immediately before, during a meal or up to one hour after a \n\nmeal. The capsule should be swallowed with water. \n\nXenical should be taken with a well-balanced, calorie controlled diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables \n\nand contains an average of 30 % of the calories from fat. Your daily intake of fat, carbohydrate and \n\nprotein should be distributed over three meals. This means you will usually take one capsule at \n\nbreakfast time, one capsule at lunch time and one capsule at dinner time. To gain optimal benefit, \n\navoid the intake of food containing fat between meals, such as biscuits, chocolate and savoury snacks. \n\nXenical only works in the presence of dietary fat. Therefore, if you miss a main meal or if you have a \n\nmeal containing no fat, Xenical need not be taken. \n\nTell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken your medicine exactly as prescribed. Otherwise, \n\nyour doctor may think that it was not effective or well tolerated and may change your treatment \n\nunnecessarily. \n\nYour doctor will discontinue the treatment with Xenical after 12 weeks if you have not lost at least \n\n5 % of your body weight as measured at the start of treatment with Xenical. \n\nXenical has been studied in long-term clinical studies of up to 4 years duration. \n\nIf you take more XENICAL than you should \n\nIf you take more capsules than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes your \n\nmedicine, contact a doctor, pharmacist or hospital as you may need medical attention. \n\nIf you forget to take XENICAL \n\nIf you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember provided this is \n\nwithin one hour of your last meal, then continue to take it at the usual times. Do not take a double \n\ndose. If you have missed several doses, please inform your doctor and follow the advice given to you. \n\nDo not change the prescribed dose yourself unless your doctor tells you to. \n\nIf you have further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, Xenical can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Xenical. \n\nThe majority of unwanted effects related to the use of Xenical result from its local action in your \n\ndigestive system. These symptoms are generally mild, occur at the beginning of treatment and are \n\nparticularly experienced after meals containing high levels of fat. Normally, these symptoms disappear \n\nif you continue treatment and keep to your recommended diet. \n\nVery common side effects (affects more than 1 user in 10) \n\nHeadache, abdominal pain/discomfort, urgent or increased need to open the bowels, flatulence (wind) \n\nwith discharge, oily discharge, oily or fatty stools, liquid stools, low blood sugar levels (experienced \n\nby some people with type 2 diabetes). \n\n\n\n25 \n\nCommon side effects (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \n\nRectal pain/discomfort, soft stools, incontinence (stools), bloating (experienced by some people with \n\ntype 2 diabetes), tooth/gum disorder, irregularity of menstrual cycle, tiredness. \n\nThe following side effects have also been reported but their frequency cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data: \n\nAllergic reactions. The main symptoms are itching, rash, wheals (slightly elevated, itchy skin patches \n\nthat are paler or redder than surrounding skin), severe difficulty in breathing, nausea, vomiting and \n\nfeeling unwell. Skin blistering (including blisters that burst). Diverticulitis. Bleeding from the back \n\npassage (rectum). Increases in the levels of some liver enzymes may be found in blood tests. Hepatitis \n\n(inflammation of the liver). Symptoms can include yellowing skin and eyes, itching, dark coloured \n\nurine, stomach pain and liver tenderness (indicated by pain under the front of the rib cage on your \n\nright hand side), sometimes with loss of appetite. Stop Xenical if such symptoms occur and tell your \n\ndoctor. Gallstones. Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Oxalate nephropathy (build up of \n\ncalcium oxalate which may lead to kidney stones). See Chapter 2, take special care with Xenical. \n\nEffects on clotting with anti-coagulants. \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V*. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \n\nof this medicine. \n\n5. How to store XENICAL\n\nKeep out of the sight and reach of children \n\nBlister packs \n\nDo not use Xenical after the expiry date stated on the carton. \n\nDo not store above 25 \uf0b0C. \n\nStore in original package and keep the blister in the outer carton in order to protect from light and \n\nmoisture.  \n\nGlass bottles \n\nDo not use Xenical after the expiry date stated on the bottle. \n\nDo not store above 30 \uf0b0C.  \n\nKeep container tightly closed in order to protect from moisture. \n\nMedicines should not be disposed via wastewater or household waste.

"always take xenical exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the usual dose of xenical is one 120 mg capsule taken with each of the three main meals per day. it can be taken immediately before, during a meal or up to one hour after a meal. the capsule should be swallowed with water. xenical should be taken with a well-balanced, calorie controlled diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables and contains an average of 30 % of the calories from fat. your daily intake of fat, carbohydrate and protein should be distributed over three meals. this means you will usually take one capsule at breakfast time, one capsule at lunch time and one capsule at dinner time. to gain optimal benefit, avoid the intake of food containing fat between meals, such as biscuits, chocolate and savoury snacks. xenical only works in the presence of dietary fat. therefore, if you miss a main meal or if you have a meal containing no fat, xenical need not be taken. tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken your medicine exactly as prescribed. otherwise, your doctor may think that it was not effective or well tolerated and may change your treatment unnecessarily. your doctor will discontinue the treatment with xenical after 12 weeks if you have not lost at least 5 % of your body weight as measured at the start of treatment with xenical. xenical has been studied in long-term clinical studies of up to 4 years duration. if you take more xenical than you should if you take more capsules than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact a doctor, pharmacist or hospital as you may need medical attention. if you forget to take xenical if you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember provided this is within one hour of your last meal, then continue to take it at the usual times. do not take a double dose. if you have missed several doses, please inform your doctor and follow the advice given to you. do not change the prescribed dose yourself unless your doctor tells you to. if you have further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "xenical", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 0, "BeginOffset": 144, "EndOffset": 151, "Score":
