NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLevetiracetam SUN 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 100 mg of levetiracetam.  \nEach 5 ml vial contains 500 mg of levetiracetam.  \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach vial contains 19 mg of sodium  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLevetiracetam SUN is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed \nepilepsy. \n \nLevetiracetam SUN is indicated as adjunctive therapy \n- in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, \n\nadolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy \n- in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with \n\nJuvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy \n- in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 \n\nyears of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. \n \nLevetiracetam SUN concentrate is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily \nnot feasible. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nLevetiracetam therapy can be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. \nConversion to or from oral to intravenous administration can be done directly without titration. The \ntotal daily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained. \n \nMonotherapy for adults and adolescents from 16 years of age \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg \ntwice daily every two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1500 mg \ntwice daily. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nAdd-on therapy for adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more \n \nThe initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of \ntreatment. \nDepending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg \ntwice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decreases every two to four \nweeks. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nThere is no experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for longer period than 4 days. \n \nDiscontinuation \n \nIf levetiracetam has to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually (e.g. in adults and \nadolescents weighing more than 50 kg: 500 mg decreases twice daily every two to four weeks; in \nchildren and adolescents weighting less than 50 kg: dose decrease should not exceed 10 mg/kg twice \ndaily every two weeks). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (65 years and older) \n \nAdjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function (see \n\"Renal impairment\" below). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe daily dose must be individualised according to renal function. \n \nFor adult patients, refer to the following table and adjust the dose as indicated. To use this dosing \ntable, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in ml/min is needed. The CLcr in ml/min \nmay be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination, for adults and adolescents weighting \n50 kg or more, the following formula: \n \n   [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) \nCLcr (ml/min) = -------------------------------------- (x 0.85 for women)  \n   72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) \n \nThen CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows: \n \n   CLcr (ml/min) \nCLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) = -------------------------------- x 1.73 \n   BSA subject (m2) \n \nDosing adjustment for adult and adolescents patients weighing more than 50 kg with impaired renal \nfunction \n \nGroup Creatinine clearance Dose and frequency \n (ml/min/1.73 m2)  \nNormal ≥ 80 500 to 1,500 mg twice daily \nMild 50-79 500 to 1,000 mg twice daily \nModerate 30-49 250 to 750 mg twice daily \nSevere < 30 250 to 500 mg twice daily \nEnd-stage renal disease patients -- 500 to 1,000 mg once daily (2) \nundergoing dialysis (1)   \n(1) A 750 mg loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with levetiracetam. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n(2) Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended. \n \nFor children with renal impairment, levetiracetam dose needs to be adjusted based on the renal \nfunction as levetiracetam clearance is related to renal function. This recommendation is based on a \nstudy in adult renally impaired patients. \n \nThe CLcr in ml/min/1.73 m2 may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dl) determination using, for \nyoung adolescents and children using the following formula (Schwartz formula): \n \n\nHeight (cm) x ks \nCLcr (ml/min/1.73 m2) = ------------------------------------------- \n\nSerum Creatinine (mg/dl) \n \n\nks= 0.55 in Children to less than 13 years and in adolescent female; ks= 0.7 in adolescent male \n \nDosing adjustment for children and adolescents patients weighing less than 50 kg with impaired renal \nfunction \n \nGroup Creatinine clearance \n\n(ml/min/1.73 m2) \nDose and frequency \n\nChildren from 4 years and adolescents weighing less \nthan 50 kg \n\nNormal ≥ 80 10 to 30 mg/kg (0.10 to 0.30 ml/kg) twice daily \nMild 50-79 10 to 20 mg/kg (0.10 to 0.20 ml/kg) twice daily \nModerate 30-49 5 to 15 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.15 ml/kg) twice daily \nSevere < 30 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) twice daily \nEnd-stage renal \ndisease patients \nundergoing dialysis \n\n-- 10 to 20 mg/kg (0.10 to 0.20 ml/kg) once daily (1) (2) \n\n(1) A 15 mg/kg (0.15 ml/kg) loading dose is recommended on the first day of treatment with \nlevetiracetam. \n(2) Following dialysis, a 5 to 10 mg/kg (0.05 to 0.10 ml/kg) supplemental dose is recommended. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate the renal insufficiency. \nTherefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine \nclearance is < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form, presentation and strength \naccording to age, weight and dose. \n \nMonotherapy \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Levetiracetam SUN in children below and adolescents 16 years as \nmonotherapy treatment have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nAdd-on therapy for children aged 4 to 11 years and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing less than \n50 kg \n \nThe initial therapeutic dose is 10 mg/kg twice daily. \nDepending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the dose can be increased up to 30 mg/kg twice \ndaily. Dose changes should not exceed increases or decreases of 10 mg/kg twice daily every two \nweeks. The lowest effective dose should be used. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nDose in children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults. \n \nDose recommendations for children and adolescents: \nWeight Starting dose: \n\n10 mg/kg twice daily \nMaximum dose: \n30 mg/kg twice daily \n\n15 kg (1) 150 mg twice daily 450 mg twice daily \n20 kg (1) 200 mg twice daily 600 mg twice daily \n25 kg 250 mg twice daily 750 mg twice daily \nFrom 50 kg(2) 500 mg twice daily 1500 mg twice daily \n(1) Children 25 kg or less should preferably start the treatment with an oral solution. \n(2) Dose in children and adolescents 50 kg or more is the same as in adults. \n \nAdd-on therapy for infants and children less than 4 years \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Levetiracetam SUN concentrate for solution for infusion in infants and \nchildren less than 4 years have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nLevetiracetam SUN concentrate is for intravenous use only and the recommended dose must be \ndiluted in at least 100 ml of a compatible diluent and administered intravenously as a 15-minute \nintravenous infusion (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal impairment \nThe administration of levetiracetam to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In \npatients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before \ndose selection (see section 4.2). \n \nAcute kidney injury \nThe use of levetiracetam has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury, with a time to onset \nranging from a few days to several months. \n \nBlood cell counts \nRare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, \nthrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with levetiracetam \nadministration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in \npatients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders \n(section 4.8). \n \nSuicide \nSuicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with \nanti-epileptic agents (including levetiracetam). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled \ntrials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. \n \nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours \nand appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised \nto seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nAvailable data in children did not suggest impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects \non learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children \nremain unknown. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains 2.5 mmol (or 57 mg) sodium per maximum single dose (0.8 mmol (or \n19 mg) per vial). To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products \nPre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that levetiracetam did not \ninfluence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these \nantiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. \n \nAs in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric \npatients receiving up to 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam. A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic \ninteractions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy \nwith orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the steady-state serum concentrations of \nconcomitantly administered carbamazepine and valproate. However, data suggested a 20% higher \nlevetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose \nadjustment is not required. \n \nProbenecid \nProbenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to \ninhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite but not of levetiracetam. Nevertheless, the \nconcentration of this metabolite remains low. \n \nMethotrexate \nConcomitant administration of levetiracetam and methotrexate has been reported to decrease \nmethotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to \npotentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in \npatients treated concomitantly with the two drugs \n \nOral contraceptives and other pharmacokinetics interactions \nLevetiracetam 1,000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinyl-\nestradiol and levonorgestrel); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and progesterone) were not \nmodified. Levetiracetam 2,000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and \nwarfarin; prothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with digoxin, oral contraceptives \nand warfarin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam. \n \nAlcohol \nNo data on the interaction of levetiracetam with alcohol are available. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential  \nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. Treatment with \nlevetiracetam should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become pregnant. As with all \nantiepileptic medicines, sudden discontinuation of levetiracetam should be avoided as this may lead to \nbreakthrough seizures that could have serious consequences for the woman and the unborn child. \nMonotherapy should be preferred whenever possible because therapy with multiple antiepileptic \nmedicines AEDs could be associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than \nmonotherapy, depending on the associated antiepileptics. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nPregnancy \nA large amount of postmarketing data on pregnant women exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy \n(more than 1800, among which in more than 1500 exposure occurred during the 1st trimester) do not \nsuggest an increase in the risk for major congenital malformations. Only limited evidence is available \non the neurodevelopment of children exposed to levetiracetam monotherapy in utero. However, \ncurrent epidemiological studies (on about 100 children) do not suggest an increased risk of \nneurodevelopmental disorders or delays.  \nLevetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, if after careful assessment it is considered clinically \nneeded. In such case, the lowest effective dose is recommended. \n \nPhysiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in \nlevetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more \npronounced during the third trimester (up to 60% of baseline concentration before pregnancy). \nAppropriate clinical management of pregnant women treated with levetiracetam should be ensured.  \n \nBreastfeeding \nLevetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended. \nHowever, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment \nshould be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nNo impact on fertility was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). No clinical data are available, \npotential risk for human is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLevetiracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to \npossible different individual sensitivity, some patients might experience somnolence or other central \nnervous system related symptoms, especially at the beginning of treatment or following a dose \nincrease. Therefore, caution is recommended in those patients when performing skilled tasks, e.g. \ndriving vehicles or operating machinery. Patients are advised not to drive or use machines until it is \nestablished that their ability to perform such activities is not affected. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, somnolence, headache, fatigue \nand dizziness. The adverse reaction profile presented below is based on the analysis of pooled \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials with all indications studied, with a total of 3,416 patients treated with \nlevetiracetam. These data are supplemented with the use of levetiracetam in corresponding open-label \nextension studies, as well as post-marketing experience. The safety profile of levetiracetam is \ngenerally similar across age groups (adult and paediatric patients) and across the approved epilepsy \nindications. Since there was limited exposure for levetiracetam intravenous use and since oral and \nintravenous formulations are bioequivalent, the safety information of levetiracetam intravenous will \nrely on levetiracetam oral use. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies (adults, adolescents, children and infants > 1 month) and \nfrom post-marketing experience are listed in the following table per System Organ Class and per \nfrequency. Adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness and their frequency \nis defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10); uncommon: (≥ 1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nMedDRA SOC Frequency category Very common Common Uncommon  Rare \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nNasopharyngitis    Infection \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n  Thrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia \n\nPancytopenia \nneutropenia, \nagranulocytosis \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Drug reaction \nwith eosinophilia \nand systemic \nsymptoms \n(DRESS), \nhypersensitivity \n(including \nangioedema and \nanaphylaxis) \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Anorexia Weight decreased, \nweight increase \n\nHyponatraemia \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depression, hostility/ \naggression, anxiety, \ninsomnia, \nnervousness/irritability \n\nSuicide attempt, \nsuicidal ideation, \npsychotic disorder, \nabnormal \nbehaviour, \nhallucination, \nanger, confusional \nstate, panic attack, \naffectlability/mood \nswings, agitation \n\nCompleted \nsuicide, \npersonality \ndisorder, thinking \nabnormal, \ndelirium \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nSomnolence, \nheadache \n\nConvulsion, balance \ndisorder, dizziness, \nlethargy, tremor \n\nAmnesia, memory \nimpairment, \ncoordination \nabnormal/ataxia, \nparaesthesia, \ndisturbance in \nattention \n\nChoreoathetosis, \ndyskinesia, \nhyperkinesia, gait \ndisturbance. \nencophalopathy \n\nEye disorders   Diplopia, vision \nblurred \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo   \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Abdominal pain, \ndiarrhoea, dyspepsia, \nvomiting, nausea \n\n Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Liver function test \nabnormal \n\nHepatic failure, \nhepatitis \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n   Acute kidney \ninjury \n\nSkin and  Rash Alopecia, eczema, Toxic epidermal \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nMedDRA SOC Frequency category Very common Common Uncommon  Rare \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\npruritus,  necrolysis, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nerythema \nmultiforme \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Muscular \nweakness, myalgia \n\nRhabdomyolysis \nand blood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased* \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Asthenia/fatigue   \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n  Injury  \n\n \n* Prevalence is significantly higher in Japanese patients when compared to non-Japanese patients.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThe risk of anorexia is higher when levetiracetam is coadministered with topiramate. \nIn several cases of alopecia, recovery was observed when levetiracetam was discontinued. \nBone marrow suppression was identified in some of the cases of pancytopenia. \n \nCases of encephalopathy generally occurred at the beginning of the treatment (few days to a few \nmonths) and were reversible after treatment discontinuation. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients aged 1 month to less than 4 years, a total of 190 patients have been treated with \nlevetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies. Sixty of these patients were \ntreated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In patients aged 4-16 years, a total of 645 \npatients have been treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies. \n233 of these patients were treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies. In both these \npaediatric age ranges, these data are supplemented with the post-marketing experience of the use of \nlevetiracetam. \n \nIn addition, 101 infants aged less than 12 months have been exposed in a post authorization safety \nstudy. No new safety concerns for levetiracetam were identified for infants less than 12 months of age \nwith epilepsy.  \n \nThe adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups and across the \napproved epilepsy indications. Safety results in paediatric patients in placebo-controlled clinical \nstudies were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and \npsychiatric adverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults. In children and \nadolescents aged 4 to 16 years, vomiting (very common, 11.2%), agitation (common, 3.4%), mood \nswings (common, 2.1%), affect lability (common, 1.7%), aggression (common, 8.2%), abnormal \nbehaviour (common, 5.6%), and lethargy (common, 3.9%) were reported more frequently than in other \nage ranges or in the overall safety profile. In infants and children aged 1 month to less than 4 years, \nirritability (very common, 11.7%) and coordination abnormal (common, 3.3%) were reported more \nfrequently than in other age groups or in the overall safety profile.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed \nthe cognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with \npartial onset seizures. It was concluded that levetiracetam was not different (non inferior) from \nplacebo with regard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory \nScreen Composite score in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional \nfunctioning indicated a worsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behaviour as \nmeasured in a standardized and systematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL – Achenbach \nChild Behavior Checklist).  \nHowever subjects, who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label follow-up study, did not \nexperience a worsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional functioning; in particular \nmeasures of aggressive behavior were not worse than baseline. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma \nwere observed with levetiracetam overdoses. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for levetiracetam. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may \ninclude haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for levetiracetam and 74 % for the \nprimary metabolite. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX14. \n \nThe active substance, levetiracetam, is a pyrrolidone derivative (S-enantiomer of \nα-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide), chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active \nsubstances. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro and in vivo \nexperiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal \nneurotransmission. \n \nIn vitro studies show that levetiracetam affects intraneuronal Ca2+ levels by partial inhibition of N-type \nCa2+ currents and by reducing the release of Ca2+ from intraneuronal stores. In addition, it partially \nreverses the reductions in GABA- and glycine-gated currents induced by zinc and β-carbolines. \nFurthermore, levetiracetam has been shown in in vitro studies to bind to a specific site in rodent brain \ntissue. This binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, believed to be involved in vesicle fusion \nand neurotransmitter exocytosis. Levetiracetam and related analogues show a rank order of affinity for \nbinding to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A which correlates with the potency of their anti-seizure \nprotection in the mouse audiogenic model of epilepsy. This finding suggests that the interaction \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nbetween levetiracetam and the synaptic vesicle protein 2A seems to contribute to the antiepileptic \nmechanism of action of the medicinal product. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLevetiracetam induces seizure protection in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary \ngeneralised seizures without having a pro-convulsant effect. The primary metabolite is inactive. In \nman, an activity in both partial and generalised epilepsy conditions (epileptiform discharge/ \nphotoparoxysmal response) has confirmed the broad spectrum pharmacological profile of \nlevetiracetam. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation \nin adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy: \n \nIn adults, levetiracetam efficacy has been demonstrated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nat 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day, given in 2 divided doses, with a treatment duration of up to 18 \nweeks. In a pooled analysis, the percentage of patients who achieved 50% or greater reduction from \nbaseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week at stable dose (12/14 weeks) was of 27.7%, \n31.6% and 41.3% for patients on 1000, 2000 or 3000 mg levetiracetam respectively and of 12.6% for \npatients on placebo. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), levetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study, which included 198 patients and had a treatment duration of 14 weeks. In \nthis study, the patients received levetiracetam as a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg/day (with twice a day \ndosing). \n44.6% of the levetiracetam treated patients and 19.6% of the patients on placebo had a 50% or greater \nreduction from baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week. With continued long-term \ntreatment, 11.4% of the patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months and 7.2% were seizure-free for \nat least 1 year. \n35 infants aged less than 1 year with partial onset seizures have been exposed in placebo-control \nclinical studies of which only 13 were aged < 6 months. \n \nMonotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in \npatients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. \n \nEfficacy of levetiracetam as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-\ninferiority comparison to carbamazepine controlled release (CR) in 576 patients 16 years of age or \nolder with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial \nseizures or with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only. The patients were randomized to \ncarbamazepine CR 400 – 1200 mg/day or levetiracetam 1000 – 3000 mg/day, the duration of the \ntreatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response. \nSix-month seizure freedom was achieved in 73.0% of levetiracetam-treated patients and 72.8% of \ncarbamazepine-CR treated patients; the adjusted absolute difference between treatments was 0.2% \n(95% CI: -7.8 8.2). More than half of the subjects remained seizure free for 12 months (56.6% and \n58.5% of subjects on levetiracetam and on carbamazepine CR respectively). \n \nIn a study reflecting clinical practice, the concomitant antiepileptic medication could be withdrawn in \na limited number of patients who responded to levetiracetam adjunctive therapy (36 adult patients out \nof 69). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nAdjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of \nage with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. \n \nLevetiracetam efficacy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 16 weeks \nduration, in patients 12 years of age and older suffering from idiopathic generalized epilepsy with \nmyoclonic seizures in different syndromes. The majority of patients presented with juvenile myoclonic \nepilepsy. \nIn this study, levetiracetam, dose was 3000 mg/day given in 2 divided doses.  \n58.3% of the levetiracetam treated patients and 23.3% of the patients on placebo had at least a 50% \nreduction in myoclonic seizure days per week. With continued long-term treatment, 28.6% of the \npatients were free of myoclonic seizures for at least 6 months and 21.0% were free of myoclonic \nseizures for at least 1 year. \n \nAdjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and \nadolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. \n \nLevetiracetam efficacy was established in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study which \nincluded adults, adolescents and a limited number of children suffering from idiopathic generalized \nepilepsy with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in different syndromes (juvenile \nmyoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand \nMal seizures on awakening). In this study, levetiracetam dose was 3000 mg/day for adults and \nadolescents or 60 mg/kg/day for children, given in 2 divided doses. \n72.2% of the levetiracetam treated patients and 45.2% of the patients on placebo had a 50% or greater \ndecrease in the frequency of PGTC seizures per week. With continued long-term treatment, 47.4% of \nthe patients were free of tonic-clonic seizures for at least 6 months and 31.5% were free of tonic-clonic \nseizures for at least 1 year. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile has been characterized following oral administration. A single dose of \n1500 mg levetiracetam diluted in 100 ml of a compatible diluent and infused intravenously over 15 \nminutes is bioequivalent to 1500 mg levetiracetam oral intake, given as three 500 mg tablets. \n \nThe intravenous administration of doses up to 4000 mg diluted in 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride \ninfused over 15 minutes and doses up to 2500 mg diluted in 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride infused \nover 5 minutes was evaluated. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles did not identify any safety \nconcerns. \n \nLevetiracetam is a highly soluble and permeable compound. The pharmacokinetic profile is linear with \nlow intra- and inter-subject variability. There is no modification of the clearance after repeated \nadministration. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was also confirmed \nfollowing 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with twice daily dosing. \nThere is no evidence for any relevant gender, race or circadian variability. The pharmacokinetic \nprofile is comparable in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy. \n \nAdults and adolescents \n \nDistribution \n \nPeak plasma concentration (Cmax) observed in 17 subjects following a single intravenous dose of \n1500 mg infused over 15 minutes was 51 ± 19 μg/mL (arithmetic average ± standard deviation). \n \nNo tissue distribution data are available in humans. \nNeither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolite are significantly bound to plasma proteins (< 10 %). \nThe volume of distribution of levetiracetam is approximately 0.5 to 0.7 l/kg, a value close to the total \nbody water volume. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nLevetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. The major metabolic pathway (24 % of the \ndose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. Production of the primary metabolite, ucb \nL057, is not supported by liver cytochrome P450 isoforms. Hydrolysis of the acetamide group was \nmeasurable in a large number of tissues including blood cells. The metabolite ucb L057 is \npharmacologically inactive. \n \nTwo minor metabolites were also identified. One was obtained by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidone \nring (1.6 % of the dose) and the other one by opening of the pyrrolidone ring (0.9 % of the dose). \nOther unidentified components accounted only for 0.6 % of the dose. \n \nNo enantiomeric interconversion was evidenced in vivo for either levetiracetam or its primary \nmetabolite. \n \nIn vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human \nliver cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl \ntransferase (UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities. In addition, levetiracetam \ndoes not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of valproic acid. \nIn human hepatocytes in culture, levetiracetam had little or no effect on CYP1A2, SULT1E1 or \nUGT1A1. Levetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and in \nvivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme \ninduction is expected in vivo. Therefore, the interaction of levetiracetam with other substances, or vice \nversa, is unlikely. \n \nElimination \n \nThe plasma half-life in adults was 7±1 hours and did not vary either with dose, route of administration \nor repeated administration. The mean total body clearance was 0.96 ml/min/kg. \n \nThe major route of excretion was via urine, accounting for a mean 95 % of the dose (approximately  \n93 % of the dose was excreted within 48 hours). Excretion via faeces accounted for only 0.3 % of the \ndose. The cumulative urinary excretion of levetiracetam and its primary metabolite accounted for 66 \n% and 24 % of the dose, respectively during the first 48 hours. \n \nThe renal clearance of levetiracetam and ucb L057 is 0.6 and 4.2 ml/min/kg respectively indicating \nthat levetiracetam is excreted by glomerular filtration with subsequent tubular reabsorption and that \nthe primary metabolite is also excreted by active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. \nLevetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. \n \nElderly \n \nIn the elderly, the half-life is increased by about 40 % (10 to 11 hours). This is related to the decrease \nin renal function in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe apparent body clearance of both levetiracetam and of its primary metabolite is correlated to the \ncreatinine clearance. It is therefore recommended to adjust the maintenance daily dose of \nlevetiracetam, based on creatinine clearance in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment \n(see section 4.2). \n \nIn anuric end-stage renal disease adult subjects the half-life was approximately 25 and 3.1 hours \nduring interdialytic and intradialytic periods, respectively. The fractional removal of levetiracetam was \n51 % during a typical 4-hour dialysis session.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nIn subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, there was no relevant modification of the \nclearance of levetiracetam. In most subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the clearance of \nlevetiracetam was reduced by more than 50 % due to a concomitant renal impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren (4 to 12 years) \n \nThe pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients has not been investigated after intravenous administration. \nHowever, based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of levetiracetam, the pharmacokinetics in \nadults after intravenous administration and the pharmacokinetics in children after oral administration, \nthe exposure (AUC) of levetiracetam is expected to be similar in paediatric patients aged 4 to 12 years \nafter intravenous and oral administration. \n \nFollowing single oral dose administration (20 mg/kg) to epileptic children (6 to 12 years), the half-life \nof levetiracetam was 6.0 hours. The apparent body weight adjusted clearance was approximately 30 % \nhigher than in epileptic adults. \n \nFollowing repeated oral dose administration (20 to 60 mg/kg/day) to epileptic children (4 to 12 years), \nlevetiracetam was rapidly absorbed. Peak plasma concentration was observed 0.5 to 1.0 hour after \ndosing. Linear and dose proportional increases were observed for peak plasma concentrations and area \nunder the curve. The elimination half-life was approximately 5 hours. The apparent body clearance \nwas 1.1 ml/min/kg. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \nAdverse effects not observed in clinical studies but seen in the rat and to a lesser extent in the mouse at \nexposure levels similar to human exposure levels and with possible relevance for clinical use were \nliver changes, indicating an adaptive response such as increased weight and centrilobular hypertrophy, \nfatty infiltration and increased liver enzymes in plasma. \n \nNo adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction performance were observed in rats at \ndoses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 or exposure basis) in parents and F1 \ngeneration. \n \nTwo embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies were performed in rats at 400, 1200 and \n3600 mg/kg/day. At 3600 mg/kg/day, in only one of the 2 EFD studies, there was a slight decrease in \nfoetal weight associated with a marginal increase in skeletal variations/minor anomalies. There was no \neffect on embryomortality and no increased incidence of malformations. The NOAEL (No Observed \nAdverse Effect Level) was 3600 mg/kg/day for pregnant female rats (x 12 the MRHD on a mg/m2 \nbasis) and 1200 mg/kg/day for fetuses. \nFour embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rabbits covering doses of 200, 600, 800, \n1200 and 1800 mg/kg/day. The dose level of 1800 mg/kg/day induced a marked maternal toxicity and \na decrease in foetal weight associated with increased incidence of fetuses with cardiovascular/skeletal \nanomalies. The NOAEL was <200 mg/kg/day for the dams and 200 mg/kg/day for the fetuses (equal \nto the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).  \nA peri- and post-natal development study was performed in rats with levetiracetam doses of 70, 350 \nand 1800 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was ≥ 1800 mg/kg/day for the F0 females, and for the survival, \ngrowth and development of the F1 offspring up to weaning.(x 6 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). \n \nNeonatal and juvenile animal studies in rats and dogs demonstrated that there were no adverse effects \nseen in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints at doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (x \n6-17 the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Levetiracetam SUN is and what is it used for \n \nLevetiracetam is an antiepileptic medicine (a medicine used to treat seizures in epilepsy). \n \nLevetiracetam SUN is used  \n- on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to \n\ntreat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits \n(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one \nside of the brain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial \nonset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given to you by \nyour doctor to reduce the number of fits \n\n- with other antiepileptic medicines (add-on therapy) to treat: \n- partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents and children  \n\n from 4 years of age \n- myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults and \n\nadolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy \n- primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in \n\nadults and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type \nof epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). \n\n \nLevetiracetam SUN concentrate for solution for infusion can be used when administration of oral \nlevetiracetam is temporarily impossible. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Levetiracetam SUN \n \nDo not use Levetiracetam SUN \n- if you are allergic to levetiracetam, pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Levetiracetam SUN \n- If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor's instructions. He/she may decide if \n\nyour dose should be adjusted. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n- If you notice any slow down in growth, or if there is unexpected puberty development in your \nchild, please contact your doctor. \n\n- A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Levetiracetam SUN have \nhad thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or \nthoughts about committing suicide, please contact your doctor. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nLevetiracetam SUN is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on its own \n(monotherapy). \n \nOther medicines and Levetiracetam SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nDo not take macrogol (a drug used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking \nlevetiracetam as this may results in a reduction of its effect.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only \nif after careful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor. \nYou should not stop your treatment without discussing this with your doctor. \nA risk of birth defects for your unborn child cannot be completely excluded.  \nBreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLevetiracetam SUN may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may \nmake you feel sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. \nYou should not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities \nis not affected. \n \nLevetiracetam SUN contains sodium \nOne maximum single dose of Levetiracetam SUN concentrate contains 2.5 mmol (or 57 mg) of \nsodium (0.8 mmol (or 19 mg) of sodium per vial). This should be taken into consideration if you are \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How Levetiracetam SUN is given \n \nA doctor or a nurse will administer you Levetiracetam SUN as an intravenous infusion. \nLevetiracetam SUN must be administered twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, at \nabout the same time each day. \n \nThe intravenous formulation is an alternative to the oral formulation. You can be switched from one to \nthe other without changing dose. Your total daily dose and frequency of administration remain the \nsame. \n \nMonotherapy \n \nDose in adults and adolescents (from 16 years of age) \nWhen you will first start taking Levetiracetam SUN, your doctor will prescribe a lower dose for 2 \nweeks before adjusting the dose as necessary. \nGeneral dose: between 1,000 mg and 3,000 mg each day. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nAdd-on therapy \n \nDose in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more \nGeneral dose: between 1,000 mg and 3,000 mg each day. \n \nDose in children (4 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing less than 50 kg \nGeneral dose: between 20 mg per kg bodyweight and 60 mg per kg bodyweight each day. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nLevetiracetam SUN is for intravenous use. \nThe recommended dose must be diluted in at least 100 ml of a compatible diluent and infused over \n15 minutes. For doctors and nurses, more detailed direction for the proper use of Levetiracetam SUN \nis provided in section 6. \n \nDuration of treatment \nThere is no experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a longer period than \n4 days. \n \nIf you stop using Levetiracetam SUN \nIf stopping treatment, as with other antiepileptic medicines, Levetiracetam SUN should be \ndiscontinued gradually to avoid an increase of seizures. Should your doctor decide to stop your \nLevetiracetam SUN treatment, he/she will instruct you about the gradual withdrawal of Levetiracetam \nSUN. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
