NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nEVRA 203 micrograms/24 hours + 33.9 micrograms/24 hours transdermal patch\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach 20 cm2 transdermal patch contains 6 mg norelgestromin (NGMN) and 600 micrograms ethinyl \nestradiol (EE).\n\nEach transdermal patch releases an average of 203 micrograms of NGMN and 33.9 micrograms of EE \nper 24 hours. Medicinal product exposure is more appropriately characterised by the pharmacokinetic \nprofile (see section 5.2).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTransdermal patch.\n\nThin, matrix-type transdermal patch consisting of three layers.\n\nThe outside of the backing layer is beige and heat-stamped “EVRA”.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFemale contraception\n\nEVRA is intended for women of fertile age. The safety and efficacy has been established in women \naged 18 to 45 years.\n\nThe decision to prescribe EVRA should take into consideration the individual woman’s current risk \nfactors, particularly those for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and how the risk of VTE with EVRA \ncompares with other CHCs (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nTo achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, patients must be advised to use EVRA exactly as \ndirected. For initiation instructions see ‘How to start EVRA’ below.\n\nOnly one transdermal patch is to be worn at a time.\n\nEach used transdermal patch is removed and immediately replaced with a new one on the same day of \nthe week (Change Day) on Day 8 and Day 15 of the cycle. Transdermal patch changes may occur at \nany time on the scheduled Change Day. The fourth week is transdermal patch-free starting on Day 22.\n\nA new contraceptive cycle begins on the next day following transdermal patch-free week; the next \nEVRA transdermal patch should be applied even if there has been no withdrawal bleeding or if \nwithdrawal bleeding has not yet stopped.\n\nUnder no circumstances should there be more than a 7-day transdermal patch-free interval between \ndosing cycles. If there are more than 7 transdermal patch-free days, the user may not be protected \n\n\n\n3\n\nagainst pregnancy. A non-hormonal contraceptive must then be used concurrently for 7 days. The risk \nof ovulation increases with each day beyond the recommended contraceptive-free period. If \nintercourse has occurred during such an extended transdermal patch-free interval, the possibility of \npregnancy should be considered.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nBody weight equal or greater than 90 kg\nContraceptive efficacy may be decreased in women weighing equal or greater than 90 kg.\n\nRenal impairment\nEVRA has not been studied in women with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is necessary but as \nthere is a suggestion in the literature that the unbound fraction of ethinyl estradiol is higher, EVRA \nshould be used with supervision in this population.\n\nHepatic impairment\nEVRA has not been studied in women with hepatic impairment. EVRA is contraindicated in women \nwith hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\nPost-menopausal women\nEVRA is not indicated for post-menopausal women and is not intended for use as hormonal \nreplacement therapy.\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and efficacy have not been established in adolescents under 18 years of age. There is no \nrelevant use of EVRA in children and pre-menarchal adolescents.\n\nMethod of administration\nEVRA should be applied to clean, dry, hairless, intact healthy skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper \nouter arm or upper torso, in a place where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. EVRA should not be \nplaced on the breasts or on skin that is red, irritated or cut. Each consecutive transdermal patch should \nbe applied to a different place on the skin to help avoid potential irritation, although they may be kept \nwithin the same anatomic site.\n\nThe transdermal patch should be pressed down firmly until the edges stick well.\n\nTo prevent interference with the adhesive properties of the transdermal patch, no make-up, creams, \nlotions, powders or other topical products should be applied to the skin area where the transdermal \npatch is placed or where it will be applied shortly.\n\nIt is recommended that users visually check their transdermal patch daily to ensure continued proper \nadhesion.\n\nThe EVRA transdermal patch should not be cut, damaged or altered in any way as this may \ncompromise contraceptive effectiveness.\n\nUsed transdermal patches should be discarded carefully in accordance with the instructions given in \nsection 6.6.\n\nHow to start EVRA\n\nWhen there has been no hormonal contraceptive use in the preceding cycle\nContraception with EVRA begins on the first day of menses. A single transdermal patch is applied and \nworn for one full week (7 days). The day the first transdermal patch is applied (Day 1/Start Day) \ndetermines the subsequent Change Days. The transdermal patch Change Day will be on this day every \nweek (cycle Days 8, 15, 22 and Day 1 of the next cycle). The fourth week is transdermal patch-free \nstarting on Day 22.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIf Cycle 1 therapy starts after first day of the menstrual cycle, a non-hormonal contraceptive should be \nused concurrently for the first 7 consecutive days of the first treatment cycle only.\n\nWhen switching from an oral combined contraceptive\nTreatment with EVRA should begin on the first day of withdrawal bleeding. If there is no withdrawal \nbleeding within 5 days of the last active (hormone containing) tablet, pregnancy must be ruled out \nprior to the start of treatment with EVRA. If therapy starts after the first day of withdrawal bleeding, a \nnon-hormonal contraceptive must be used concurrently for 7 days.\n\nIf more than 7 days elapse after taking the last active oral contraceptive tablet, the woman may have \novulated and should, therefore, be advised to consult a physician before initiating treatment with \nEVRA. If intercourse has occurred during such an extended pill-free interval, the possibility of \npregnancy should be considered.\n\nWhen changing from a progestogen-only-method\nThe woman may switch any day from the progestogen-only pill (from an implant on the day of its \nremoval, from an injectable when the next injection would be due), but a back-up barrier method of \nbirth control must be used during the first 7 days.\n\nFollowing abortion or miscarriage\nAfter an abortion or miscarriage that occurs before 20 weeks gestation, EVRA may be started \nimmediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if EVRA is started immediately. Be \nadvised that ovulation may occur within 10 days of an abortion or miscarriage.\n\nAfter an abortion or miscarriage that occurs at or after 20 weeks gestation, EVRA may be started \neither on Day 21 post-abortion or on the first day of the first spontaneous menstruation, whichever \ncomes first. The incidence of ovulation on Day 21 post abortion (at 20 weeks gestation) is not known.\n\nFollowing delivery\nUsers who choose not to breast-feed should start contraceptive therapy with EVRA no sooner than \n4 weeks after child-birth. When starting later, the woman should be advised to additionally use a \nbarrier method for the first 7 days. However, if intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be \nexcluded before the actual start of EVRA or the woman has to wait for her first menstrual period.\n\nFor breast-feeding women, see section 4.6.\n\nWhat to do if the transdermal patch comes off or partly detaches\nIf the EVRA transdermal patch partly or completely detaches and remains detached, insufficient \nmedicinal product delivery occurs.\n\nIf EVRA remains even partly detached:\n- for less than one day (up to 24 hours): it should be re-applied to the same place or replaced with \n\na new EVRA transdermal patch immediately. No additional contraceptive is needed. The next \nEVRA transdermal patch should be applied on the usual “Change Day”.\n\n- for more than one day (24 hours or more) or if the user is not aware when the transdermal patch \nhas lifted or become detached: the user may not be protected from pregnancy: The user should \nstop the current contraceptive cycle and start a new cycle immediately by applying a new \nEVRA transdermal patch. There is now a new “Day 1” and a new “Change Day”. A \nnon-hormonal contraceptive must be used concurrently for the first 7 days of the new cycle \nonly.\n\nA transdermal patch should not be re-applied if it is no longer sticky; a new transdermal patch should \nbe applied immediately. Supplemental adhesives or bandages should not be used to hold the EVRA \ntransdermal patch in place.\n\n\n\n5\n\nIf subsequent EVRA transdermal patch change days are delayed\n\nAt the start of any transdermal patch cycle (Week One/Day 1)\nThe user may not be protected from pregnancy. The user should apply the first transdermal patch of \nthe new cycle as soon as remembered. There is now a new transdermal patch “Change Day” and a new \n“Day 1”. A non-hormonal contraceptive must be used concurrently for the first 7 days of the new \ncycle. If intercourse has occurred during such an extended transdermal patch-free interval, the \npossibility of pregnancy should be considered.\n\nIn the middle of the cycle (Week Two/Day 8 or Week Three/Day 15)\n- for one or two days (up to 48 hours): The user should apply a new EVRA transdermal patch \n\nimmediately. The next EVRA transdermal patch should be applied on the usual “Change Day”. \nIf during the 7 days preceding the first skipped day of transdermal patch application, the\ntransdermal patch was worn correctly, no additional contraceptive use is required.\n\n- for more than two days (48 hours or more): The user may not be protected from pregnancy. The \nuser should stop the current contraceptive cycle and start a new four-week cycle immediately by \nputting on a new EVRA transdermal patch. There is now a new “Day 1” and a new “Change \nDay”. A non-hormonal contraceptive must be used concurrently for the first 7 consecutive days \nof the new cycle.\n\nAt the end of the cycle (Week Four/Day 22)\n- If the EVRA transdermal patch is not removed at the beginning of Week 4 (Day 22), it should \n\nbe removed as soon as possible. The next cycle should begin on the usual “Change Day”, which \nis the day after Day 28. No additional contraceptive use is required.\n\nChange day adjustment\nIn order to postpone a menstrual period for one cycle, the woman must apply another transdermal\npatch at the beginning of Week 4 (Day 22) thus not observing the transdermal patch-free interval. \nBreakthrough bleeding or spotting may occur. After 6 consecutive weeks of transdermal patch wear, \nthere should be a transdermal patch-free interval of 7 days. Following this, the regular application of \nEVRA is resumed.\n\nIf the user wishes to move the Change Day the current cycle should be completed, removing the third \nEVRA transdermal patch on the correct day. During the transdermal patch-free week a new Change \nDay may be selected by applying the first EVRA transdermal patch of the next cycle on the first \noccurrence of the desired day. In no case should there be more than 7 consecutive transdermal \npatch-free days. The shorter the transdermal patch-free interval, the higher the risk that the user does \nnot have a withdrawal bleed and may experience breakthrough bleeding and spotting during the \nsubsequent treatment cycle.\n\nIn case of minor skin irritation\nIf transdermal patch use results in uncomfortable irritation, a new transdermal patch may be applied to \na new location until the next Change Day. Only one transdermal patch should be worn at a time.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nCombined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) should not be used in the following conditions. If one of \nthese disorders occurs during the use of EVRA, EVRA must be discontinued immediately.\n Presence or risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\n Venous thromboembolism – current VTE (on anticoagulants) or history of (e.g. deep \nvenous thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]);\n\n Known hereditary or acquired predisposition for venous thromboembolism, such as \nAPC-resistance, (including Factor V Leiden), antithrombin-III-deficiency, protein C \ndeficiency, protein S deficiency;\n\n Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation (see section 4.4);\n A high risk of venous thromboembolism due to the presence of multiple risk factors (see \n\nsection 4.4);\n\n\n\n6\n\n Presence or risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE)\n Arterial thromboembolism – current arterial thromboembolism, history of arterial \n\nthromboembolism (e.g. myocardial infarction) or prodromal condition (e.g. angina \npectoris);\n\n Cerebrovascular disease – current stroke, history of stroke or prodromal condition \n(e.g. transient ischaemic attack, TIA);\n\n Known hereditary or acquired predisposition for arterial thromboembolism, such as \nhyperhomocysteinaemia and antiphospholipid-antibodies (anticardiolipin-antibodies, \nlupus anticoagulant);\n\n History of migraine with focal neurological symptoms;\n A high risk of arterial thromboembolism due to multiple risk factors (see section 4.4) or \n\nto the presence of one serious risk factor such as:\n- diabetes mellitus with vascular symptoms\n- severe hypertension\n- severe dyslipoproteinaemia\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast\n Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected oestrogen-dependent neoplasia\n Abnormal liver function related to acute or chronic hepatocellular disease\n Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas\n Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\n Concomitant use with the medicinal products containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and \n\ndasabuvir (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWarnings\n\nIf any of the conditions/risk factors mentioned below is present, the suitability of EVRA should be \ndiscussed with the woman.\n\nIn the event of aggravation, or first appearance of any of the conditions or risk factors, the woman \nshould be advised to contact her doctor to determine whether the use of EVRA should be \ndiscontinued.\n\nThere is no clinical evidence indicating that a transdermal patch is, in any aspect, safer than combined \noral contraceptives.\n\nEVRA is not indicated during pregnancy (see section 4.6).\n\nRisk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\nThe use of any combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) increases the risk of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) compared with no use. Products that contain levonorgestrel, \nnorgestimate or norethisterone are associated with the lowest risk of VTE. Other products such \nas EVRA may have up to twice this level of risk. The decision to use any product other than one \nwith the lowest VTE risk should be taken only after a discussion with the woman to ensure she \nunderstands the risk of VTE with EVRA, how her current risk factors influence this risk, and \nthat her VTE risk is highest in the first ever year of use. There is also some evidence that the risk \nis increased when a CHC is re-started after a break in use of 4 weeks or more.\n\nIn women who do not use a CHC and are not pregnant about 2 out of 10,000 will develop a VTE over \nthe period of one year. However, in any individual woman the risk may be far higher, depending on \nher underlying risk factors (see below).\n\n\n\n7\n\nIt is estimated that out of 10,000 women who use a low dose CHC that contains levonorgestrel, about \n61 will develop a VTE in one year. Studies have suggested that the incidence of VTE in women who \nused EVRA is up to 2-fold higher than in users of CHCs that contain levonorgestrel. This corresponds \nto between about 6 and 12 VTEs in a year out of 10,000 women who use EVRA.\n\nIn both cases, the number of VTEs per year is fewer than the number expected in women during \npregnancy or in the postpartum period.\n\nVTE may be fatal in 1-2% of cases.\n\nNumber of VTE events per 10,000 women in one year\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nNon-CHC user (2 events) Levonorgestrel-containing\nCHC (5-7 events)\n\nNorelgestromin-containing\nCHC (6-12 events)\n\nNumber of \nVTE events\n\nExtremely rarely, thrombosis has been reported to occur in CHC users in other blood vessels,\ne.g. hepatic, mesenteric, renal or retinal veins and arteries.\n\nRisk factors for VTE\nThe risk for venous thromboembolic complications in CHC users may increase substantially in a \nwoman with additional risk factors, particularly if there are multiple risk factors (see table).\n\nEVRA is contraindicated if a woman has multiple risk factors that put her at high risk of venous \nthrombosis (see section 4.3). If a woman has more than one risk factor, it is possible that the increase \nin risk is greater than the sum of the individual factors – in this case her total risk of VTE should be \nconsidered. If the balance of benefits and risks is considered to be negative a CHC should not be \nprescribed (see section 4.3).\n\nTable: Risk factors for VTE\nRisk factor Comment\nObesity (body mass index over \n30 kg/m²)\n\nRisk increases substantially as BMI rises.\nParticularly important to consider if other risk factors \nalso present.\n\n                                                     \n1 Mid-point of range of 5-7 per 10,000 WY, based on a relative risk for CHCs containing \nlevonorgestrel versus non-use of approximately 2.3 to 3.6\n\n\n\n8\n\nProlonged immobilisation, major \nsurgery, any surgery to the legs or pelvis, \nneurosurgery, or major trauma\n\nNote: temporary immobilisation \nincluding air travel > 4 hours can also be \na risk factor for VTE, particularly in \nwomen with other risk factors\n\nIn these situations it is advisable to discontinue the use \nof the patch (in the case of elective surgery at least four \nweeks in advance) and not resume until two weeks after \ncomplete remobilisation. Another method of \ncontraception should be used to avoid unintentional \npregnancy.\nAntithrombotic treatment should be considered if EVRA\nhas not been discontinued in advance.\n\nPositive family history (venous \nthromboembolism ever in a sibling or \nparent at relatively early age)\n\nIf a hereditary predisposition is suspected, the woman \nshould be referred to a specialist for advice before \ndeciding about any CHC use.\n\nOther medical conditions associated with \nVTE\n\nCancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, haemolytic \nuraemic syndrome, chronic inflammatory bowel disease \n(Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and sickle cell \ndisease.\n\nIncreasing age Particularly above 35 years.\n\nThere is no consensus about the possible role of varicose veins and superficial thrombophlebitis in the \nonset or progression of venous thrombosis.\n\nThe increased risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy, and particularly the 6 week period of the \npuerperium, must be considered (for information on \"Pregnancy and lactation\" see section 4.6).\n\nSymptoms of VTE (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)\nIn the event of symptoms women should be advised to seek urgent medical attention and to inform the \nhealthcare professional that she is taking a CHC.\n\nSymptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can include:\n- unilateral swelling of the leg and/or foot or along a vein in the leg;\n- pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only when standing or walking;\n- increased warmth in the affected leg; red or discoloured skin on the leg.\n\nSymptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) can include:\n- sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath or rapid breathing;\n- sudden coughing which may associated with haemoptysis;\n- sharp chest pain;\n- severe light headedness or dizziness;\n- rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n\nSome of these symptoms (e.g. “shortness of breath”, “coughing”) are non-specific and might be \nmisinterpreted as more common or less severe events (e.g. respiratory tract infections).\n\nOther signs of vascular occlusion can include: sudden pain, swelling and slight blue discoloration of \nan extremity.\n\nIf the occlusion occurs in the eye symptoms can range from painless blurring of vision which can \nprogress to loss of vision. Sometimes loss of vision can occur almost immediately.\n\nRisk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE)\nEpidemiological studies have associated the use of CHCs with an increased risk for arterial \nthromboembolism (myocardial infarction) or for cerebrovascular accident (e.g. transient ischaemic \nattack, stroke). Arterial thromboembolic events may be fatal.\n\nRisk factors for ATE\nThe risk of arterial thromboembolic complications or of a cerebrovascular accident in CHC users \nincreases in women with risk factors (see table). EVRA is contraindicated if a woman has one serious \nor multiple risk factors for ATE that puts her at high risk of arterial thrombosis (see section 4.3). If a \n\n\n\n9\n\nwoman has more than one risk factor, it is possible that the increase in risk is greater than the sum of \nthe individual factors - in this case her total risk should be considered. If the balance of benefits and \nrisks is considered to be negative a CHC should not be prescribed (see section 4.3).\n\nTable: Risk factors for ATE\nRisk factor Comment\nIncreasing age Particularly above 35 years\nSmoking Women should be advised not to smoke if they \n\nwish to use a CHC. Women over 35 who \ncontinue to smoke should be strongly advised to \nuse a different method of contraception.\n\nHypertension\nObesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m2) Risk increases substantially as BMI rises.\n\nParticularly important in women with additional \nrisk factors.\n\nPositive family history (arterial \nthromboembolism ever in a sibling or parent at \nrelatively early age e.g. below 50)\n\nIf a hereditary predisposition is suspected, the \nwoman should be referred to a specialist for \nadvice before deciding about any CHC use.\n\nMigraine An increase in frequency or severity of migraine \nduring CHC use (which may be prodromal of a \ncerebrovascular event) may be a reason for \nimmediate discontinuation.\n\nOther medical conditions associated with \nadverse vascular events\n\nDiabetes mellitus, hyperhomocysteinaemia, \nvalvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation, \ndyslipoproteinaemia, systemic lupus \nerythematosus.\n\nSymptoms of ATE\nIn the event of symptoms women should be advised to seek urgent medical attention and to inform the \nhealthcare professional that she is taking a CHC.\n\nSymptoms of a cerebrovascular accident can include:\n- sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body;\n- sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination;\n- sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding;\n- sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;\n- sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known cause;\n- loss of consciousness or fainting with or without seizure.\n\nTemporary symptoms suggest the event is a transient ischaemic attack (TIA).\n\nSymptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) can include:\n- pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness, sensation of squeezing or fullness in the chest, arm, or \n\nbelow the breastbone;\n- discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat, arm, stomach;\n- feeling of being full, having indigestion or choking;\n- sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness;\n- extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath;\n- rapid or irregular heartbeats.\n\nWomen using combined contraceptives should be emphatically advised to contact their physician in \ncase of possible symptoms of thrombosis. In case of suspected or confirmed thrombosis, hormonal \ncontraceptive use should be discontinued. Adequate contraception should be initiated because of the \nteratogenicity of anti-coagulant therapy (coumarins).\n\n\n\n10\n\nTumours\nAn increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of COCs has been reported in some \nepidemiological studies, but there continues to be controversy about the extent to which this finding is \nattributable to the confounding effects of sexual behaviour and other factors such as human papilloma \nvirus (HPV).\n\nA meta-analysis of 54 epidemiological studies reported that there is a slightly increased risk \n(RR = 1.24) of having breast cancer diagnosed in women who are currently using COCs. The excess \nrisk gradually disappears during the course of the 10 years after cessation of COC use. Because breast \ncancer is rare in women under 40 years of age, the excess number of breast cancer diagnoses in current \nand recent COC users is small in relation to the overall risk of breast cancer. The breast cancers \ndiagnosed in ever-users tend to be less advanced clinically than the cancers diagnosed in never-users. \nThe observed pattern of increased risk may be due to an earlier diagnosis of breast cancer in COC \nusers, the biological effects of COCs or a combination of both.\n\nIn rare cases, benign liver tumours, and even more rarely, malignant liver tumours have been reported \nin users of COCs. In isolated cases, these tumours have led to life-threatening intra-abdominal \nhaemorrhages. Therefore a hepatic tumour should be considered in the differential diagnosis when \nsevere upper abdominal pain, liver enlargement or signs of intra-abdominal haemorrhage occur in \nwomen using EVRA.\n\nALT elevations\nDuring clinical trials with patients treated for hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) with the medicinal \nproducts containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin, \ntransaminase (ALT) elevations higher than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred \nsignificantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as \ncombined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPsychiatric Disorders\nDepressed mood and depression are well-known undesirable effects of hormonal contraceptive use \n(see section 4.8). Depression can be serious and is a well-known risk factor for suicidal behaviour and \nsuicide. Women should be advised to contact their physician in case of mood changes and depressive \nsymptoms, including shortly after initiating the treatment.\n\nOther conditions\n- Contraceptive efficacy may be reduced in women weighing equal or greater than 90 kg (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 5.1).\n- Women with hypertriglyceridaemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of \n\npancreatitis when using combined hormonal contraceptives.\n- Although small increases of blood pressure have been reported in many women using hormonal \n\ncontraceptives, clinically relevant increases are rare. A definitive relationship between hormonal \ncontraceptive use and clinical hypertension has not been established. If, during the use of \ncombined hormonal contraceptives in pre-existing hypertension, constantly elevated blood \npressure values or a significant increase in blood pressure do not respond adequately to \nantihypertensive treatment, the combined hormonal contraceptive must be withdrawn. \nCombined hormonal contraceptive use may be resumed if normotensive values can be achieved\nwith antihypertensive therapy.\n\n- The following conditions have been reported to occur or deteriorate with both pregnancy and \nCOC use, but the evidence of an association with COC use is inconclusive: Jaundice and/or \npruritus related to cholestasis; gallbladder disease including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis; \nporphyria; systemic lupus erythematosus; haemolytic ureamic syndrome; Sydenham’s chorea; \nherpes gestationis; otosclerosis-related hearing loss.\n\n- Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of combined\nhormonal contraceptives until markers of liver function return to normal. Recurrence of \ncholestatic-related pruritus, which occurred during a previous pregnancy or previous use of sex \nsteroids necessitates the discontinuation of combined hormonal contraceptives.\n\n\n\n11\n\n- Although combined hormonal contraceptives may have an effect on peripheral insulin resistance \nand glucose tolerance, there is no evidence for a need to alter the therapeutic regimen in \ndiabetes during use of combined hormonal contraceptives. However, diabetic women should be \ncarefully observed, particularly in the early stage of EVRA use.\n\n- Worsening of endogenous depression, of epilepsy, of Crohn’s disease and of ulcerative colitis \nhas been reported during COC use.\n\n- Chloasma may occasionally occur with the use of hormonal contraception, especially in users \nwith a history of chloasma gravidarum. Users with a tendency to chloasma should avoid \nexposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using EVRA. Chloasma is often not fully \nreversible.\n\nMedical examination/consultation\nPrior to the initiation or reinstitution of EVRA a complete medical history (including family history) \nshould be taken and pregnancy should be ruled out. Blood pressure should be measured and a physical \nexamination should be performed guided by the contra-indications (see section 4.3) and warnings (see \nsection 4.4). It is important to draw a woman’s attention to the information on venous and arterial \nthrombosis, including the risk of EVRA compared with other CHCs, the symptoms of VTE and ATE, \nthe known risk factors and what to do in the event of a suspected thrombosis.\n\nThe woman should also be instructed to carefully read the user leaflet and to adhere to the advice \ngiven. The frequency and nature of examinations should be based on established practice guidelines \nand be adapted to the individual woman.\n\nWomen should be advised that hormonal contraceptives do not protect against HIV infections (AIDS) \nand other sexually transmissible diseases.\n\nBleeding irregularities\nWith all combined hormonal contraceptives, irregular blood loss (spotting or breakthrough bleeding) \ncan occur, especially during the initial months of usage. For this reason, a medical opinion on irregular \nblood loss will only be useful after an adjustment period of approximately three cycles. If \nbreakthrough bleeding persists, or breakthrough bleeding occurs after previously regular cycles, while \nEVRA has been used according to the recommended regimen, a cause other than EVRA should be \nconsidered. Non-hormonal causes should be considered and, if necessary, adequate diagnostic \nmeasures taken to rule out organic disease or pregnancy. This may include curettage. In some women \nwithdrawal bleeding may not occur during this transdermal patch free period. If EVRA has been taken \naccording to the directions described in section 4.2, it is unlikely that the woman is pregnant. \nHowever, if EVRA has not been taken according to these directions prior to the first missed \nwithdrawal bleed or if two withdrawal bleeds are missed, pregnancy must be ruled out before EVRA \nuse is continued.\n\nSome users may experience amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea after discontinuing hormonal \ncontraception, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNote: The prescribing information of concomitant medicinal products should be consulted to identify \npotential interactions.\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nConcomitant use with the medicinal products containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and \ndasabuvir, with or without ribavirin may increase the risk of ALT elevations (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nTherefore, EVRA-users must switch to an alternative method of contraception (e.g., progestagen-only \ncontraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to starting therapy with this combination drug regimen. \nEVRA can be restarted 2 weeks following completion of treatment with this combination drug \nregimen.\n\n\n\n12\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on EVRA\nInteractions can occur with drugs that induce microsomal enzymes which can result in increased\nclearance of sex hormones and which may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. \nThe following interactions have been reported in the literature.\n\nSubstances increasing the clearance of CHCs (diminished efficacy of CHCs by enzyme-induction),e.g.:\nBarbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampicin, modafinil, and HIV \nmedications ritonavir, nevirapine andefavirenz; and possibly also felbamate, griseofulvin, \noxcarbazepine, topiramate and products containing the herbal remedy St. John's Wort (hypericum \nperforatum).\n\nManagement\nEnzyme induction may be observed after a few days of treatment. Maximal enzyme induction is \ngenerally seen in about 10 days but may then be sustained for at least 4 weeks after the cessation of \nmedicinal product therapy.\n\nShort-term\nA woman on short-term treatment with medicinal products that induce hepatic drug metabolising \nenzymes or individual active substances that induce these enzymes should temporarily use a barrier \nmethod in addition to EVRA, i.e. during the time of concomitant medicinal product administration and \nfor 28 days after their discontinuation.\n\nIf concomitant medicinal product administration extends beyond the end of the three-week patch\nperiod, the next transdermal patch should be applied without the usual transdermal patch-free interval.\n\nLong-term\nIn women on long-term treatment with enzyme-inducing active substances, another reliable,\nnon-hormonal, method of contraception is recommended.\n\nSubstances with variable effects on the clearance of CHCs\nWhen co-administered with CHCs, many combinations of HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors, including combinations with HCV inhibitors can increase or decrease \nplasma concentrations of estrogen or progestins. The net effect of these changes may be clinically \nrelevant in some cases.\n\nTherefore, the prescribing information of concomitant HIV medications should be consulted to\nidentify potential interactions and any related recommendations. In case of any doubt, an additional \nbarrier contraceptive method should be used by women on protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy.\n\nInhibition of ethinyl estradiol metabolism\nEtoricoxib has been shown to increase plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol (50 to 60%) when taken \nconcomitantly with an oral triphasic hormonal contraceptive. It is thought that etoricoxib increases\nethinyl estradiol levels because it inhibits sulfotransferase activity thereby inhibiting ethinyl estradiol \nmetabolism.\n\nEffect of EVRA on other medicinal products\nHormonal contraceptives may affect the metabolism of certain other active substances. Accordingly, \nplasma and tissue concentrations may increase (e.g. ciclosporin). Dosage adjustment of the \nconcomitant medicinal product may be necessary.\n\nLamotrigine: Combined hormonal contraceptives have been shown to significantly decrease plasma \nconcentrations of lamotrigine when coadministered likely due to induction of lamotrigine \nglucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be \nnecessary.\n\n\n\n13\n\nLaboratory tests\nThe use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, including \nbiochemical parameters of liver, thyroid, adrenal and renal function, plasma levels of (carrier) \nproteins, e.g. corticosteroid-binding globulin and lipid/lipoprotein fractions, parameters of \ncarbohydrate metabolism and parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Changes generally remain \nwithin the normal laboratory range.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nEVRA is not indicated during pregnancy.\n\nEpidemiological studies indicate no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who \nused combined oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. The majority of recent studies also do not \nindicate a teratogenic effect when combined oral contraceptives are used inadvertently during early \npregnancy.\n\nLimited data on the outcomes of exposed pregnancies in women using EVRA do not allow for \nconclusions about its safety during pregnancy.\n\nAnimal studies have shown undesirable effects during pregnancy and lactation (see section 5.3). Based \non these animal data, undesirable effects due to hormonal action of the active compounds cannot be \nexcluded. However, general experience with combined oral contraceptives during pregnancy did not \nprovide evidence for an actual undesirable effect in humans.\n\nIf pregnancy occurs during use of EVRA, EVRA should be stopped immediately.\n\nThe increased risk of VTE during the postpartum period should be considered when re-starting EVRA \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\nBreast-feeding may be influenced by combined hormonal contraceptives as they may reduce the \nquantity and change the composition of breast milk. Therefore, the use of EVRA is not to be \nrecommended until the breast-feeding mother has completely weaned her child.\n\nFertility\nWomen may experience a delay in conception following discontinuation of EVRA.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEVRA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8. Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were headache, nausea, and breast \ntenderness, occurring in approximately 21.0%, 16.6%, and 15.9% of patients, respectively. Adverse \nreactions that may occur at the beginning of treatment but usually diminish after the first three cycles \ninclude spotting, breast tenderness and nausea.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nAn increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic and thrombo-embolic events, including \nmyocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism \nhas been observed in women using CHCs, which are discussed in more detail in section 4.4.\n\n\n\n14\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nSafety was evaluated in 3,322 sexually active women who participated in three Phase III clinical trials, \nwhich were designed to evaluate contraceptive efficacy. These subjects received six or 13 cycles of \ncontraception (EVRA or oral contraceptive comparator), took at least one dose of study medicinal \nproduct and provided safety data. Table 1 below reflects the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials \nand from post-marketing experience. Frequency MedDRA convention: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very\nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Frequency of adverse reactions\nSystem Organ Class\nFrequency\n\nAdverse reaction\n\nInfections and infestations\ncommon (Vulvo) vaginal fungal infection\n\nVaginal candidiasis\nrare Rash pustular*\n\nApplication site pustules\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)\nrare Hepatic neoplasm*†\n\nBreast cancer*†\nCervix carcinoma*†\nHepatic adenoma*†\nUterine leiomyoma\nFibroadenoma of breast\n\nImmune system disorders\nuncommon Hypersensitivity\nrare Anaphylactic reaction*\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nuncommon Hypercholesterolaemia\n\nFluid retention\nIncreased appetite\n\nrare Hyperglycaemia*\nInsulin resistance*\n\nPsychiatric disorders\ncommon Mood, affect and anxiety disorders\nuncommon Insomnia\n\nLibido decreased\nrare Anger*\n\nFrustration*\nLibido increased\n\nNervous system disorders\nvery common Headache\ncommon Migraine\n\nDizziness\nrare Cerebrovascular accident**†\n\nCerebral haemorrhage*†\nAbnormal taste*\n\nEye disorders\nrare Contact lens intolerance*\nCardiac disorders\nrare Arterial thromboembolism\n\n(Acute) myocardial infarction*†\nVascular disorders\nuncommon Hypertension\n\n\n\n15\n\nrare Hypertensive crisis*\nArterial thrombosis**†\nVenous thrombosis**†\nThrombosis*†\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nrare Pulmonary (artery) thrombosis*†\n\nPulmonary embolism†\nGastrointestinal disorders\nvery common Nausea\ncommon Abdominal pain\n\nVomiting\nDiarrhoea\nAbdominal distension\n\nrare Colitis*\nHepatobiliary disorders\nrare Cholecystitis\n\nCholelithiasis†\nHepatic lesion*\nJaundice cholestatic*†\nCholestasis*†\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\ncommon Acne\n\nRash\nPruritus\nSkin reaction\nSkin irritation\n\nuncommon Alopecia\nDermatitis allergic\nEczema\nPhotosensitivity reaction\nDermatitis contact\nUrticaria\nErythema\n\nrare Angioedema*\nErythema (multiforme, nodosum)*\nChloasma†\nExfoliative rash*\nPruritus generalised\nRash (erythematous, pruritic)\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis*\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\ncommon Muscle spasms\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nvery common Breast tenderness\ncommon Dysmenorrhoea\n\nVaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders**†\nUterine spasm\nBreast disorders\nVaginal discharge\n\nuncommon Galactorrhoea\nPremenstrual syndrome\nVulvovaginal dryness\n\nrare Cervical dysplasia*\nSuppressed lactation*\nGenital discharge\n\n\n\n16\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\ncommon Malaise\n\nFatigue\nApplication site reactions (erythema, irritation, pruritus, rash)\n\nuncommon Generalised oedema\nOedema peripheral\nApplication site reactions**\n\nrare Face oedema*\nPitting oedema*\nSwelling\nApplication site reactions* (e.g., abscess, erosion)\nLocalised oedema*\n\nInvestigations\ncommon Weight increased\nuncommon Blood pressure increased\n\nLipid disorders**\nrare Blood glucose decreased*†\n\nBlood glucose abnormal*†\n* Post-marketing reports.\n** Includes adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing reports.\n† See section 4.4.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSerious ill effects have not been reported following accidental ingestion of large doses of oral \ncontraceptives. Overdose may cause nausea or vomiting. Vaginal bleeding may occur in some \nfemales. In cases of suspected overdose, all transdermal contraceptive systems should be removed and \nsymptomatic treatment given.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, progestogens and \nestrogens, fixed combination; ATC-code: G03AA13.\n\nMechanism of action\nEVRA acts through the mechanism of gonadotropin suppression by the estrogenic and progestational \nactions of ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin. The primary mechanism of action is inhibition of the \novulation, but the alterations of the cervical mucus, and to the endometrium may also contribute to the \nefficacy of the product.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nPearl Indices (see table):\n\nStudy\nGroup\n\nCONT-002\nEVRA\n\nCONT-003\nEVRA\n\nCONT-003\nCOC*\n\nCONT-004\nEVRA\n\nCONT-004\nCOC**\n\nAll EVRA\nSubjects\n\n# of cycles 10,743 5,831 4,592 5,095 4,005 21,669\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n17\n\nOverall\nPearl Index\n(95% CI)\n\n0.73\n(0.15; 1.31)\n\n0.89\n(0.02; 1.76)\n\n0.57\n(0.0; 1.35)\n\n1.28\n(0.16; 2.39)\n\n2.27\n(0.59; 3.96)\n\n0.90\n(0.44; 1.35)\n\nMethod \nFailure\nPearl Index\n(95% CI)\n\n0.61\n(0.0; 1.14)\n\n0.67\n(0.0; 1.42)\n\n0.28\n(0.0; 0.84)\n\n1.02\n(0.02; 2.02)\n\n1.30\n(0.03; 2.57)\n\n0.72\n(0.31; 1.13)\n\n* DSG 150 mcg + 20 mcg EE\n** 50 mcg LNG + 30 mcg for days 1 – 6, 75 mcg LNG + 40 mcg EE for days 7 – 11, 125 mcg LNG + 30 mcg EE for 12 \n\n– 21 days\n\nExploratory analyses were performed to determine whether in the Phase III studies (n=3,319) the \npopulation characteristics of age, race and weight were associated with pregnancy. The analyses \nindicated no association of age and race with pregnancy. With respect to weight, 5 of the \n15 pregnancies reported with EVRA were among women with baseline body weight equal or greater \nthan 90 kg, which constituted < 3% of the study population. Below 90 kg there was no association \nbetween body weight and pregnancy. Although only 10-20% of the variability in pharmacokinetic data \ncan be explained by weight (see section 5.2), the greater proportions of pregnancies among women at \nor above 90 kg was statistically significant and indicates the EVRA is less effective in these women.\n\nWith the use of higher dosed COCs (50 microgram ethinyl estradiol) the risk of endometrial and \novarian cancer is reduced. Whether this is also applies to the lower dosed combined hormonal \ncontraceptives remains to be confirmed.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing application of EVRA, norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol levels in serum reach a plateau \nby approximately 48 hours. Steady state concentrations of norelgestromin and EE during one week of \ntransdermal patch wear are approximately 0.8 ng/ml and 50 pg/ml, respectively. In multiple-dose \nstudies, serum concentrations and AUC for norelgestromin and EE were found to increase only \nslightly over time when compared to week 1 cycle 1.\n\nThe absorption of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol following application of EVRA was studied \nunder conditions encountered in a health club (sauna, whirlpool, treadmill and other aerobic exercise) \nand in a cold water bath. The results indicated that for norelgestromin there were no significant \ntreatment effects on Css or AUC when compared to normal wear. For EE, slight increases were \nobserved due to treadmill and other aerobic exercise; however, the Css values following these \ntreatments were within the reference range. There was no significant effect of cool water on these \nparameters.\n\nResults from an EVRA study of extended wear of single contraceptive transdermal patch for 7 days \nand 10 days indicated that target Css of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol were maintained during a \n3-day period of extended wear of EVRA (10 days). These findings suggest that clinical efficacy would \nbe maintained even if a scheduled change is missed for as long as 2 full days.\n\nDistribution\nNorelgestromin and norgestrel (a serum metabolite of norelgestromin) are highly bound (> 97%) to \nserum proteins. Norelgestromin is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while norgestrel is bound \nprimarily to SHBG, which limits its biological activity. Ethinyl estradiol is extensively bound to serum \nalbumin.\n\nBiotransformation\nHepatic metabolism of norelgestromin occurs and metabolites include norgestrel, which is largely \nbound to SHBG, and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Ethinyl estradiol is also \nmetabolised to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.\n\n\n\n18\n\nElimination\nFollowing removal of a transdermal patch, the mean elimination half-lives of norelgestromin and \nethinyl estradiol were approximately 28 hours and 17 hours, respectively. The metabolites of \nnorelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol are eliminated by renal and faecal pathways.\n\nTransdermal versus oral contraceptives\nThe pharmacokinetic profiles of transdermal and oral combined hormonal contraceptives are different \nand caution should be exercised when making a direct comparison of these PK parameters.\n\nIn a study comparing EVRA to an oral contraceptive containing norgestimate (parent drug of \nnorelgestromin) 250 mcg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg, Cmax values were 2-fold higher for NGMN and EE \nin subjects administered the oral contraceptive compared to EVRA, while overall exposure (AUC and \nCss) was comparable in subjects treated with EVRA. Inter-subject variability (%CV) for the PK \nparameters following delivery from EVRA was higher relative to the variability determined from the \noral contraceptive.\n\nEffects of age, body weight, and body surface area\nThe effects of age, body weight, and body surface area on the pharmacokinetics of norelgestromin and \nethinyl estradiol were evaluated in 230 healthy women from nine pharmacokinetic studies of single \n7-day applications of EVRA. For both norelgestromin and EE, increasing age, body weight and body \nsurface area each were associated with slight decreases in Css and AUC values. However, only a small \nfraction (10–20%) of the overall variability in the pharmacokinetics of the norelgestromin and EE \nfollowing application of EVRA may be associated with any or all of the above demographic \nparameters.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. With respect to the \nreproductive toxicity norelgestromin showed foetal toxicity in rabbits, but the safety margin for this \neffect was sufficiently high. Data on reproductive toxicity of the combination of norelgestromin with \nethinyl estradiol are not available. Data for combination of norgestimate (precursor of norelgestromin) \nwith ethinyl estradiol indicate for female animals a decrease in fertility and implantation efficiency \n(rat), an increase in foetal resorption (rat, rabbit) and, with high dosages, a decrease in viability and \nfertility of female offspring (rat). The relevance of these data for human exposure is unknown as these \neffects have been seen as related to well-known pharmacodynamic or species-specific actions.\n\nStudies conducted to examine the dermal effect of EVRA indicate this system has no potential to \nproduce sensitisation and results in only mild irritation when applied to rabbits skin.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n31\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nEVRA 203 micrograms/24 hours + 33.9 micrograms/24 hours transdermal patch\nnorelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol\n\nImportant things to know about combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs):\n- They are one of the most reliable reversible methods of contraception if used correctly.\n- They slightly increase the risk of having a blood clot in the veins and arteries, especially in the \n\nfirst year or when restarting a combined hormonal contraceptive following a break of 4 or more \nweeks.\n\n- Please be alert and see your doctor if you get symptoms of a blood clot (see section 2 “Blood \nclots”).\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What EVRA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use EVRA\n3. How to use EVRA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store EVRA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What EVRA is and what is it used for\n\nEVRA contains two types of sex hormones, a progestogen called norelgestromin and an oestrogen \ncalled ethinyl estradiol.\n\nBecause it contains two hormones, EVRA is called a ‘combined hormonal contraceptive’.\n\nIt is used to prevent pregnancy.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use EVRA\n\nGeneral notes\nBefore you start using EVRA you should read the information on blood clots in section 2. It is\nparticularly important to read the symptoms of a blood clot - see section 2 “Blood clots”.\n\nWhen you should not use EVRA\nYou should not use EVRA if you have any of the conditions listed below. If you do have any of the \nconditions listed below, you must tell your doctor. Your doctor will discuss with you what other form \nof birth control would be more appropriate.\n if you have (or have ever had) a blood clot in a blood vessel of your legs (deep vein thrombosis,\n\nDVT), your lungs (pulmonary embolus, PE) or other organs;\n if you know you have a disorder affecting your blood clotting - for instance, protein C \n\ndeficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin-III deficiency, Factor V Leiden or \nantiphospholipid antibodies;\n\n if you need an operation or if you are off your feet for a long time (see section ‘Blood clots’);\n if you have ever had a heart attack or a stroke;\n\n\n\n32\n\n if you have (or have ever had) angina pectoris (a condition that causes severe chest pain and \nmay be a first sign of a heart attack) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA – temporary stroke \nsymptoms);\n\n if you have a disease that may increase your risk of a clot in the arteries:\n- severe diabetes with blood vessel damage\n- very high blood pressure\n- a very high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol or triglycerides)\n- a condition known as hyperhomocysteinaemia\n\n if you have (or have ever had) a type of migraine called ‘migraine with aura’;\n if you are allergic to norelgestromin, ethinyl estradiol or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6);\n if you have ever been told you might have breast cancer or cancer of the womb, cervix or \n\nvagina;\n if you have ever had liver tumours or a liver disease because of which your liver does not \n\nfunction properly;\n if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding;\n if you have hepatitis C and are taking the medicinal products containing \n\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (see also in section “Other medicines and \nEVRA”).\n\nDo not use this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor,\npharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.\n\nWhen to take special care with EVRA\nWhen should you contact your doctor?\n\nSeek urgent medical attention\n if you notice possible signs of a blood clot that may mean you are suffering from a blood clot \n\nin the leg (i.e. deep vein thrombosis), a blood clot in the lung (i.e. pulmonary embolism), a \nheart attack or a stroke (see ‘Blood clot [thrombosis] section below).\n\nFor a description of the symptoms of these serious side effects please go to “How to recognise a \nblood clot”.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nBefore using this medicine, you will need to see your doctor for a medical check-up.\n\nTell your doctor if any of the following conditions apply to you.\n\nIf the condition develops, or gets worse while you are using EVRA, you must tell your doctor.\n if you have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (chronic inflammatory bowel disease);\n if you have SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus; a disease affecting your natural defence \n\nsystem);\n if you have haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS - a disorder of blood clotting causing failure of \n\nthe kidneys);\n if you have sickle cell anaemia (an inherited disease of the red blood cells);\n if you have elevated levels of fat in the blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) or a positive family \n\nhistory for this condition. Hypertriglyceridaemia has been associated with an increased risk of \ndeveloping pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas);\n\n if you need an operation, or you are off your feet for a long time (see in section 2 ‘Blood clots’);\n if you have just given birth you are at an increased risk of blood clots. You should ask your \n\ndoctor how soon after delivery you can start taking EVRA;\n if you have an inflammation in the veins under the skin (superficial thrombophlebitis);\n if you have varicose veins.\n\n\n\n33\n\nBLOOD CLOTS\n\nUsing a combined hormonal contraceptive such as EVRA increases your risk of developing a blood \nclot compared with not using one. In rare cases a blood clot can block blood vessels and cause serious \nproblems.\n\nBlood clots can develop\n in veins (referred to as a ‘venous thrombosis’, ‘venous thromboembolism’ or VTE)\n in the arteries (referred to as an ‘arterial thrombosis’, ‘arterial thromboembolism’ or ATE).\n\nRecovery from blood clots is not always complete. Rarely, there may be serious lasting effects or, very \nrarely, they may be fatal.\n\nIt is important to remember that the overall risk of a harmful blood clot due to EVRA is small.\n\nHOW TO RECOGNISE A BLOOD CLOT\n\nSeek urgent medical attention if you notice any of the following signs or symptoms.\n\nAre you experiencing any of these signs? What are you possibly \nsuffering from?\n\n swelling of one leg or along a vein in the leg or foot \nespecially when accompanied by:\n- pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only \n\nwhen standing or walking;\n- increased warmth in the affected leg;\n- change in colour of the skin on the leg e.g. turning \n\npale, red or blue.\n\nDeep vein thrombosis\n\n sudden unexplained breathlessness or rapid breathing;\n sudden cough without an obvious cause, which may bring \n\nup blood;\n sharp chest pain which may increase with deep breathing;\n severe light headedness or dizziness;\n rapid or irregular heartbeat;\n severe pain in your stomach.\n\nIf you are unsure, talk to a doctor as some of these symptoms such \nas coughing or being short of breath may be mistaken for a milder \ncondition such as a respiratory tract infection (e.g. a ‘common \ncold’).\n\nPulmonary embolism\n\nSymptoms most commonly occur in one eye:\n immediate loss of vision or;\n painless blurring of vision which can progress to loss of \n\nvision.\n\nRetinal vein thrombosis (blood \nclot in the eye)\n\n chest pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness;\n sensation of squeezing or fullness in the chest, arm or \n\nbelow the breastbone;\n fullness, indigestion or choking feeling;\n upper body discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat, \n\narm and stomach;\n sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness;\n extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath;\n rapid or irregular heartbeats.\n\nHeart attack\n\n\n\n34\n\n sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, \nespecially on one side of the body;\n\n sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding;\n sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;\n sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or \n\ncoordination;\n sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known \n\ncause;\n loss of consciousness or fainting with or without seizure.\n\nSometimes the symptoms of stroke can be brief with an almost \nimmediate and full recovery, but you should still seek urgent \nmedical attention as you may be at risk of another stroke.\n\nStroke\n\n swelling and slight blue discolouration of an extremity;\n severe pain in your stomach (acute abdomen).\n\nBlood clots blocking other \nblood vessels\n\nBLOOD CLOTS IN A VEIN\n\nWhat can happen if a blood clot forms in a vein?\n The use of combined hormonal contraceptives has been connected with an increase in the risk of \n\nblood clots in the vein (venous thrombosis). However, these side effects are rare. Most \nfrequently, they occur in the first year of use of a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n If a blood clot forms in a vein in the leg or foot it can cause a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n If a blood clot travels from the leg and lodges in the lung it can cause a pulmonary embolism.\n Very rarely a clot may form in a vein in another organ such as the eye (retinal vein thrombosis).\n\nWhen is the risk of developing a blood clot in a vein highest?\nThe risk of developing a blood clot in a vein is highest during the first year of taking a combined \nhormonal contraceptive for the first time. The risk may also be higher if you restart taking a combined \nhormonal contraceptive (the same product or a different product) after a break of 4 weeks or more.\n\nAfter the first year, the risk gets smaller but is always slightly higher than if you were not using a \ncombined hormonal contraceptive.\n\nWhen you stop EVRA your risk of a blood clot returns to normal within a few weeks.\n\nWhat is the risk of developing a blood clot?\nThe risk depends on your natural risk of VTE and the type of combined hormonal contraceptive you \nare taking.\n\nThe overall risk of a blood clot in the leg or lung (DVT or PE) with EVRA is small.\n\n- Out of 10,000 women who are not using any combined hormonal contraceptive and are not \npregnant, about 2 will develop a blood clot in a year.\n\n- Out of 10,000 women who are using a combined hormonal contraceptive that contains \nlevonorgestrel, norethisterone, or norgestimate about 5-7 will develop a blood clot in a year.\n\n- Out of 10,000 women who are using a combined hormonal contraceptive that contains \netonorgestrel or norelgestromin such as EVRA between about 6 and 12 women will develop a \nblood clot in a year.\n\n- The risk of having a blood clot will vary according to your personal medical history (see \n“Factors that increase your risk of a blood clot” below).\n\nRisk of developing a blood clot in a year\nWomen who are not using a combined \nhormonal pill/patch/ring and are not pregnant\n\nAbout 2 out of 10,000 women\n\n\n\n35\n\nWomen using a combined hormonal \ncontraceptive pill containing levonorgestrel, \nnorethisterone or norgestimate\n\nAbout 5-7 out of 10,000 women\n\nWomen using EVRA About 6-12 out of 10,000 women\n\nFactors that increase your risk of a blood clot in a vein\nThe risk of a blood clot with EVRA is small but some conditions will increase the risk. Your risk is \nhigher:\n if you are very overweight (body mass index or BMI over 30 kg/m2);\n if one of your immediate family has had a blood clot in the leg, lung or other organ at a young \n\nage (e.g. below the age of about 50). In this case you could have a hereditary blood clotting \ndisorder;\n\n if you need to have an operation, or if you are off your feet for a long time because of an injury \nor illness, or you have your leg in a cast. The use of EVRA may need to be stopped several \nweeks before surgery or while you are less mobile. If you need to stop EVRA ask your doctor \nwhen you can start using it again;\n\n as you get older (particularly above about 35 years);\n if you gave birth less than a few weeks ago.\n\nThe risk of developing a blood clot increases the more conditions you have.\n\nAir travel (> 4 hours) may temporarily increase your risk of a blood clot, particularly if you have some\nof the other factors listed.\n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you, even if you are unsure. Your\ndoctor may decide that EVRA needs to be stopped.\n\nIf any of the above conditions change while you are using EVRA, for example a close family member \nexperiences a thrombosis for no known reason; or you gain a lot of weight, tell your doctor.\n\nBLOOD CLOTS IN AN ARTERY\n\nWhat can happen if a blood clot forms in an artery?\nLike a blood clot in a vein, a clot in an artery can cause serious problems. For example, it can cause a\nheart attack or a stroke.\n\nFactors that increase your risk of a blood clot in an artery\nIt is important to note that the risk of a heart attack or stroke from using EVRA is very small but can \nincrease:\n with increasing age (beyond about 35 years);\n if you smoke. When using a combined hormonal contraceptive like EVRA you are advised to \n\nstop smoking. If you are unable to stop smoking and are older than 35 your doctor may advise \nyou to use a different type of contraceptive;\n\n if you are overweight;\n if you have high blood pressure;\n if a member of your immediate family has had a heart attack or stroke at a young age (less then \n\nabout 50). In this case you could also have a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke;\n if you, or someone in your immediate family, have a high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol\n\nor triglycerides);\n if you get migraines, especially migraines with aura;\n if you have a problem with your heart (valve disorder, disturbance of the rhythm called atrial\n\nfibrillation);\n if you have diabetes.\n\nIf you have more than one of these conditions or if any of them are particularly severe the risk of\ndeveloping a blood clot may be increased even more.\n\n\n\n36\n\nIf any of the above conditions change while you are using EVRA, for example you start smoking, a \nclose family member experiences a thrombosis for no known reason; or you gain a lot of weight, tell \nyour doctor.\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nSome women using hormonal contraceptives including EVRA have reported depression or depressed \nmood. Depression can be serious and may sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts. If you experience \nmood changes and depressive symptoms contact your doctor for further medical advice as soon as \npossible.\n\nAdditionally, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using EVRA if you have any of the \nfollowing or they happen or get worse while using EVRA:\n You think you might be pregnant;\n You have headaches that get worse or happen more often;\n You weigh 90 kg (which is 14 stone 2 lb) or more;\n You have high blood pressure or your blood pressure gets higher;\n You have gallbladder disease including gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder;\n You have a blood problem called porphyria;\n You have a problem of the nervous system involving sudden movements of the body called \n\n‘Sydenham’s chorea’;\n You had a skin rash with blisters during pregnancy (called ‘herpes gestationis’);\n You have a hearing loss;\n You have diabetes;\n You have depression;\n You have epilepsy or any other problem that can cause fits (convulsions);\n You have liver problems including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eye (jaundice);\n You have or have had ‘pregnancy spots’. These are yellowish-brown patches or spots, \n\nespecially on your face (called ‘chloasma’). These spots may not go away completely, even \nafter you stop using EVRA. Protect your skin from sunlight or ultraviolet radiation. This may \nhelp prevent you from getting these spots or help prevent them from getting worse.\n\n You have kidney problems.\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \nEVRA.\n\nSexually transmitted disease\nThis medicine will not protect you against HIV infection (AIDS) or any other sexually transmitted \ndisease. These include chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B, syphilis. \nAlways use condoms to protect yourself from these diseases.\n\nMedical tests\n If you need a blood or urine test, tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are taking \n\nEVRA, because hormonal contraceptives can affect the results of some tests.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nEVRA has not been studied in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. EVRA must not be \nused in children and adolescents who have not yet had their first menstrual period.\n\nOther medicines and EVRA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nDo not use EVRA if you have Hepatitis C and are taking the medicinal products containing \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir as this may cause increases in liver function blood test \n\n\n\n37\n\nresults (increase in ALT liver enzyme). Your doctor will prescribe another type of contraceptive prior \nto start of the treatment with these medicinal products. EVRA can be restarted approximately 2 weeks \nafter completion of this treatment. See section “When you should not use EVRA”.\n\nCertain medicines and herbal therapies may stop EVRA from working properly. If this happens you \ncould get pregnant, or may experience unexpected bleeding.\nThese include medicines used for the treatment of:\n some antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C virus infections (so-\n\ncalled protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as ritonavir, \nnevirapine, efavirenz)\n\n medicines for infection (such as rifampicin and griseofulvin)\n anti-seizure medicines (such as barbiturates, topiramate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, \n\noxcarbazepine, and felbamate)\n bosentan (a medicine for high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs)\n St. John’s wort (an herbal therapy used for depression)\n\nIf you take any of these medicines, you may need to use another method of birth control (such as a \ncondom, diaphragm or foam). The interfering effect of some of these medicines can last for up to \n28 days after you have stopped taking them. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about using another \nmethod of birth control if you use EVRA and any of the above medicines concomitantly.\n\nEVRA may make some other medicines less effective, such as:\n medicines containing ciclosporin\n lamotrigine used for epilepsy [This can increase the risk of fits (seizures)].\n\nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of the other medicine.

As the EVRA \ntransdermal patch contains similar hormones to those used in combined birth control pills, it is likely \nto have the same risks. All combined birth control pills have risks, which may lead to disability or \ndeath.\n\nIt has not been shown that a transdermal patch like EVRA is safer than a combined birth control pill \ntaken by mouth.\n\nCombined hormonal contraceptives and cancer\n\nCervical cancer\nCervical cancer has been found more often in women taking combined hormonal contraceptives. \nHowever, this may be due to other causes including sexually-transmitted disease.\n\n\n\n38\n\nBreast cancer\nBreast cancer has been found more often in women who take combined hormonal contraceptives. \nHowever, it is possible that the combined hormonal contraceptive is not the cause of more women \nhaving breast cancer. It may be that women taking the combined hormonal contraceptive are examined \nmore often. This might mean that there is a better chance of the breast cancer being noticed. The \nincreased risk gradually goes down after stopping the combined hormonal contraceptive. After \n10 years, the risk is the same as for people who have never used the combined hormonal \ncontraceptive.\n\nLiver cancer\nIn rare cases, liver tumours which are not cancer have been found in women taking combined \nhormonal contraceptives. Even more rarely, liver tumours which are cancer have been found. This can \ncause bleeding inside the body with very bad pain in the stomach area. If this happens to you, talk to \nyour doctor immediately.\n\n3. How to use EVRA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.\n\n If you do not, you may increase your risk of getting pregnant.\n Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.\n Always keep non-hormonal contraceptives (such as condoms, foam or sponge) as a back-up in \n\ncase you make a mistake when using the patch.\n\nHow many patches to use\n Weeks 1, 2 & 3: Put on one patch and leave it on for exactly seven days.\n Week 4: Do not put on a patch this week.\n\nIf you have not used a hormonal contraceptive during your previous cycle\n You may start this medicine on the first day of your next period.\n If one or more days have elapsed since the start of your period, talk to your doctor about \n\ntemporarily using a non-hormonal contraceptive.\n\nIf you switch from the oral contraceptive pill to EVRA\nIf you are switching from an oral contraceptive pill to this medicine:\n Wait until you get your menstrual period.\n Put on your first patch during the first 24 hours of your period.\n\nIf the patch is applied after Day 1 of your period, you should:\n Use a non-hormonal contraceptive until Day 8 when you change your patch.\n\nIf you do not get your period within 5 days of taking the last contraceptive pill, check with your doctor \nbefore starting this medicine.\n\nIf you switch from the progestogen-only pill, an implant or an injectable to EVRA\n You may start this medicine any day after stopping the progestogen-only pill or on the day of \n\nremoval of an implant or when the next injection would be due.\n The first day after stopping the progestogen-only pill, removing the implant or when your next \n\ninjection would be due, put on a patch.\n Use a non-hormonal contraceptive until Day 8, when you change your patch.\n\nAfter miscarriage or abortion before 20 weeks of pregnancy\n Talk to your doctor.\n You may start this medicine right away.\n\n\n\n39\n\nIf one or more days have elapsed since your miscarriage or abortion when you start this medicine, talk \nto your doctor about temporarily using a non-hormonal contraceptive.\n\nAfter miscarriage or abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy\n Talk to your doctor.\n\nYou may start this medicine on Day 21 following the abortion or miscarriage, or on the first day of \nyour next period, whichever comes first.\n\nAfter delivery\n Talk to your doctor.\n If you’ve had a baby and are not breast-feeding, you should not start using this medicine sooner \n\nthan 4 weeks after delivery.\n If you start more than 4 weeks after delivery, use another non-hormonal contraceptive in \n\naddition to this medicine for the first 7 days.\n\nIf you’ve had sex since delivery of your baby, wait for your first period or see your doctor to make \nsure you are not pregnant before starting this medicine.\n\nIf you are breast-feeding\n Talk to your doctor.\n Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed (see also section 2\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding).\n\nImportant information to follow when using the patch\n Change EVRA on the same day of each week. This is because it is designed to work over \n\n7 days.\n Never go without wearing a patch for more than 7 days in a row.\n Only wear one patch at a time.\n Do not cut or tamper with the patch in any way.\n Do not put the patch on skin that is red, irritated or cut.\n To work properly the patch must stick firmly to your skin.\n Press the patch down firmly until the edges stick well.\n Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powder or makeup on the skin where you are placing a patch or \n\nnear a patch you are wearing. This may make the patch come loose.\n Do not put a new patch on the same area of skin as the old patch. If you do you are more likely \n\nto cause irritation.\n Check each day to make sure the patch has not fallen off.\n Keep using the patches even if you do not have sex very often.\n\nHow to use the patch:\nIf this is the first time you are using EVRA, wait until the day you get \nyour menstrual period.\n\n Apply your first patch during the first 24 hours of your period\n If the patch is put on after the first day of your period, use a \n\nnon-hormonal contraceptive until Day 8, when you change your \npatch\n\n The day you apply your first patch will be Day 1. Your “Patch \nChange Day” will be on this day of the week every week.\n\n\n\n40\n\nChoose a place on your body to put the patch.\n\n Always put your patch on clean, dry, hairless skin\n Put it on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm or upper back -\n\nplaces where it won’t be rubbed by tight clothing\n Never put the patch on your breasts.\n\nUsing your fingers, open the foil sachet.\n\n Open it by tearing it along the edge (do not use scissors)\n Firmly grasp a corner of the patch and gently take it from the foil \n\nsachet\n There is a clear protective covering on the patch\n Sometimes patches can stick to the inside of the sachet – be \n\ncareful not to accidentally remove the clear covering as you \nremove the patch\n\n Then peel away half of the clear protective covering (see picture). \nTry not to touch the sticky surface.\n\nPut the patch on your skin.\n\n Then take off the other half of the covering\n Press down firmly on the patch with the palm of your hand for \n\n10 seconds\n Make sure that the edges stick well.\n\nWear the patch for 7 days (one week).\n\n On the first “Patch Change Day”, Day 8, take off the used patch\n Put on a new patch immediately.\n\n On Day 15 (Week 3), take off the used patch\n Put on another new one.\n\nThis makes a total of three weeks with the patches.\n\nTo help stop irritation, do not put the new patch on exactly the same \narea of your skin as your last patch.\n\nDo not wear a patch on Week 4 (Day 22 through Day 28).\n\n You should have your period during this time\n During this week you are protected from getting pregnant only if \n\nyou start your next patch on time.\n\n\n\n41\n\nFor your next four week cycle.\n\n Put on a new patch on your normal “Patch Change Day”, the day \nafter Day 28\n\n Do this no matter when your period begins or ends.\n\nIf you want to change your “Patch Change Day” to a different day of the week talk to your doctor.\nYou will need to complete the current cycle and remove the third patch on the correct day. During \nWeek 4, you may pick a new Change Day and apply the first patch on that day. You should never go \nmore than 7 days in a row without wearing a patch.\n\nIf you want to delay your period, apply a patch at the beginning of Week 4 (Day 22) instead of not \nwearing a patch on Week 4. You may experience light or breakthrough bleeding. Do not wear more \nthan 6 patches (so not more than 6 weeks) in a row. When you have worn 6 patches in a row (so for \n6 consecutive weeks), do not put on a patch in week 7. After 7 days of not wearing a patch, apply a \nnew patch and restart the cycle using this as Day 1. Talk with your doctor before deciding to delay \nyour period.\n\nEveryday activities while using the patches\n Normal activities such as having a bath or shower, using a sauna and exercising should not \n\naffect how well the patch works.\n The patch is designed to stay in place during these types of activities.\n However, you should check that the patch has not fallen off after doing these activities.\n\nIf you need to place the patch on a new area on your body on a day other than your “Patch \nChange Day”\nIf the patch causes irritation or you become uncomfortable wearing it:\n You can take it off and replace it with a new patch in a different place on your body until your \n\nnext “Patch Change Day”\n You may only use one patch at a time.\n\nIf you have trouble remembering to change your patch\n Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. He/she may be able to make patch changing easier for \n\nyou. He/she may also talk about whether you need to use another method of contraception.\n\nIf your patch becomes loose, lifts at the edges or falls off\n\nFor less than one day (up to 24 hours):\n Try to put it on again or put on a new patch immediately.\n Back-up contraception is not needed.\n Your “Patch Change Day” should remain the same.\n Do not try to put a patch back on if:\n\n- it is no longer sticky\n- it has become stuck to itself or another surface\n- it has other material stuck to it\n- it is the second time it has become loose or has fallen off.\n\n Do not use tapes or wrapping to keep the patch in place.\n If you cannot get a patch back on, put on a new patch immediately.\n\nFor more than one day (24 hours or more) or if you are not sure for how long:\n Start a new four week cycle immediately by putting on a new patch.\n You now have a new Day 1 and a new “Patch Change Day”.\n You must use non-hormonal contraception as back up for the first week of your new cycle.\n\n\n\n42\n\nYou may get pregnant if you do not follow these instructions.\n\nIf you forget to change your patch\n\nAt the start of any patch cycle (Week 1 (Day 1)):\nIf you forget to put on your patch, you may be at particularly high risk of becoming pregnant.\n You must use non-hormonal contraception as back up for one week.\n Put on the first patch of your new cycle as soon as you remember.\n You now have a new “Patch Change Day” and new Day 1.\n\nIn the middle of your patch cycle (Week 2 or 3):\nIf you forget to change your patch for one or two days (up to 48 hours):\n You must put on a new patch as soon as you remember.\n Put on your next patch on your normal “Patch Change Day”.\n\nNo back up contraception is needed.\n\nFor more than 2 days (48 hours or more):\n If you forget to change your patch for more than 2 days, you may become pregnant.\n You must start a new four week cycle as soon as you remember by putting on a new patch.\n You now have a different “Patch Change Day” and a new Day 1.\n You must use back-up contraception for the first week of your new cycle.\n\nAt the end of your patch cycle (Week 4):\nIf you forget to take off your patch:\n Take it off as soon as you remember.\n Start your next cycle on your normal “Patch Change Day”, the day after Day 28.\n\nNo back-up contraception is needed.\n\nIf you have absent or irregular bleeding with EVRA\nThis medicine may cause unexpected vaginal bleeding or spotting during the weeks when you are \nwearing the patch.\n This usually stops after the first few cycles.\n Mistakes in using your patches can also cause spotting and light bleeding.\n Continue using this medicine and if the bleeding lasts more than the first three cycles, talk to \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you do not get your period during the EVRA patch-free week (Week 4), you should still use a new \npatch on your usual “Patch Change Day”.\n If you have been using this medicine correctly and you do not have a period, this does not \n\nnecessarily mean that you are pregnant.\n However, if you miss two periods in a row, talk to your doctor or pharmacist as you may be \n\npregnant.\n\nIf you use more EVRA than you should (more than one EVRA patch at any one time)\nTake the patches off and talk to a doctor immediately.\n\nUsing too many patches may cause you to have the following:\n Feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n Bleeding from the vagina.\n\nIf you stop using EVRA\nYou may get irregular, little or no menstruation. This usually happens in the first 3 months and \nespecially if your periods were not regular before you started using this medicine.\n\n\n\n43\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.
