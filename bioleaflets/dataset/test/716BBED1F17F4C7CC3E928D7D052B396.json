CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBexsero is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from 2 months of age and older against \ninvasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B. The impact of invasive \ndisease in different age groups as well as the variability of antigen epidemiology for group B strains in \ndifferent geographical areas should be considered when vaccinating. See section 5.1 for information \non protection against specific group B strains. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with \nofficial recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\nTable 1.

The safety and efficacy of \n\nBexsero in infants less than 8 weeks of age has not yet been established. No data are available. \nb In case of delay, the booster should not be given later than 24 months of age. \nc See section 5.1. The need for and timing of further booster doses has not yet been determined. \nd See section 5.1. \n* There are no data in adults above 50 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe vaccine is given by deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh \nin infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older subjects. \n \nSeparate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is administered at the same time. \n \nThe vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be \nmixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. \n \nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\nAs with other vaccines, administration of Bexsero should be postponed in subjects suffering from an \nacute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result \nin the deferral of vaccination. \n \nDo not inject intravascularly. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nAnxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related \nreactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection \n(see section 4.8). It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n \nThis vaccine should not be given to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder \nthat would contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the \nrisk of administration. \n \nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Bexsero may not protect all vaccine recipients.  \nBexsero is not expected to provide protection against all circulating meningococcal group B strains \n(see section 5.1). \n \nAs with many vaccines, healthcare professionals should be aware that a temperature elevation may \noccur following vaccination of infants and children (less than 2 years of age). Prophylactic \nadministration of antipyretics at the time and closely after vaccination can reduce the incidence and \nintensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Antipyretic medication should be initiated according to \nlocal guidelines in infants and children (less than 2 years of age). \n \nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immune-suppressive \ntherapy, a genetic disorder, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active \nimmunisation. \nImmunogenicity data are available in individuals with complement deficiencies, asplenia, or splenic \ndysfunctions (see section 5.1). \n \nIndividuals with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C3 or C5 deficiencies) and \nindividuals receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) \nare at increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B, even if they \ndevelop antibodies following vaccination with Bexsero. \n \nThere are no data on the use of Bexsero in subjects above 50 years of age and limited data in patients \nwith chronic medical conditions. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be \nconsidered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants \n(born \u2264 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory \nimmaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not \nbe withheld or delayed. \n \nThe tip cap of the syringe may contain natural rubber latex. Although the risk for developing allergic \nreactions is very small, healthcare professionals should consider the benefit-risk prior to administering \nthis vaccine to subjects with known history of hypersensitivity to latex. \n \nKanamycin is used in early manufacturing process and is removed during the later stages of \nmanufacture. If present, kanamycin levels in the final vaccine are less than 0.01 micrograms per dose. \nThe safe use of Bexsero in kanamycin-sensitive individuals has not been established. \n \nTraceability \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nUse with other vaccines \n \nBexsero can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as monovalent \nor as combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, \ninactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate, measles, mumps, rubella, \nvaricella, and meningococcal groups A, C, W, Y conjugate. \n \nClinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses of the co-administered routine vaccines were \nunaffected by concomitant administration of Bexsero, based on non-inferior antibody response rates to \nthe routine vaccines given alone. Inconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to \ninactivated poliovirus type 2 and pneumococcal conjugate serotype 6B and lower antibody titers to the \npertussis pertactin antigen were also noted, but these data do not suggest clinically significant \ninterference. \n \nDue to an increased risk of fever, tenderness at the injection site, change in eating habits and \nirritability when Bexsero was co-administered with the above vaccines, separate vaccinations can be \nconsidered when possible. Prophylactic use of paracetamol reduces the incidence and severity of fever \nwithout affecting the immunogenicity of either Bexsero or routine vaccines. The effect of antipyretics \nother than paracetamol on the immune response has not been studied. \n \nConcomitant administration of Bexsero with vaccines other than those mentioned above has not been \nstudied. \n \nWhen given concomitantly with other vaccines Bexsero must be administered at separate injection \nsites (see section 4.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nInsufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nThe potential risk for pregnant women is unknown. Nevertheless, vaccination should not be withheld \nwhen there is a clear risk of exposure to meningococcal infection. \n \nThere was no evidence of maternal or foetal toxicity, and no effects on pregnancy, maternal behaviour, \nfemale fertility, or postnatal development in a study in which female rabbits received Bexsero at \napproximately 10 times the human dose equivalent based on body weights. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nInformation on the safety of the vaccine to women and their children during breast-feeding is not \navailable. The benefit-risk ratio must be examined before making the decision to immunise during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nNo adverse reactions were seen in vaccinated maternal rabbits or in their offspring through day 29 of \nlactation. Bexsero was immunogenic in maternal animals vaccinated prior to lactation, and antibodies \nwere detected in the offspring, but antibody levels in milk were not determined. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on fertility in humans. \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\n \nThere were no effects on female fertility in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the \neffects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may temporarily affect the ability to drive or \nuse machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Bexsero was evaluated in 17 studies including 10 randomised controlled clinical trials \nwith 10565 subjects (from 2 months of age) who received at least one dose of Bexsero. Among \nBexsero recipients, 6837 were infants and children (less than 2 years of age), 1051 were children \n(2 to 10 years of age) and 2677 were adolescents and adults. Of the subjects who received primary \ninfant series of Bexsero, 3285 received a booster dose in the second year of life.   \n \nIn infants and children (less than 2 years of age) the most common local and systemic adverse \nreactions observed in clinical trials were tenderness and erythema at the injection site, fever and \nirritability. \n \nIn clinical studies in infants vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) was reported \nby 69% to 79% of subjects when Bexsero was co-administered with routine vaccines (containing the \nfollowing antigens: pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis \nB, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b) compared with 44% to 59% of \nsubjects receiving the routine vaccines alone. Higher rates of antipyretic use were also reported for \ninfants vaccinated with Bexsero and routine vaccines. When Bexsero was given alone, the frequency \nof fever was similar to that associated with routine infant vaccines administered during clinical trials. \nWhen fever occurred, it generally followed a predictable pattern, with the majority resolving by the \nday after vaccination. \n \nIn adolescents and adults the most common local and systemic adverse reactions observed were pain at \nthe injection site, malaise and headache. \n \nNo increase in the incidence or severity of the adverse reactions was seen with subsequent doses of the \nvaccination series. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions (following primary immunisation or booster dose) considered as being at least \npossibly related to vaccination have been categorised by frequency. \n \nFrequencies are defined as follows: \nVery common: (\u22651/10) \nCommon: (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare: (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000) \nNot known:  (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nIn addition to reports in clinical trials, worldwide voluntary reports of adverse reactions received for \nBexsero since market introduction are included in the list. Because these reactions are reported \n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency and they are consequently listed with the frequency unknown. \n \nInfants and children (up to 10 years of age) \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known: allergic reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: eating disorders \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: sleepiness, unusual crying, headache \nUncommon: seizures (including febrile seizures) \nNot known: hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, meningeal irritation (signs of meningeal irritation, \nsuch as neck stiffness or photophobia, have been sporadically reported shortly after vaccination. These \nsymptoms have been of mild and transient nature) \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: pallor (rare after booster) \nRare: Kawasaki syndrome \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting (uncommon after booster) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common: rash (children aged 12 to 23 months) (uncommon after booster) \nCommon: rash (infants and children 2 to 10 years of age) \nUncommon: eczema \nRare: urticaria \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: arthralgia  \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: fever (\u226538\u00b0C), injection site tenderness (including severe injection site tenderness \ndefined as crying when injected limb is moved), injection site erythema, injection site swelling, \ninjection site induration, irritability \nUncommon: fever (\u226540\u00b0C) \nNot known: injection site reactions (including extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, blisters at or \naround the injection site and injection site nodule which may persist for more than one month) \n \nAdolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known: allergic reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nNot known: syncope or vasovagal responses to injection, meningeal irritation (signs of meningeal \nirritation, such as neck stiffness or photophobia, have been sporadically reported shortly after \nvaccination. These symptoms have been of mild and transient nature) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nNot known: rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: myalgia, arthralgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site pain (including severe injection site pain defined as unable to perform \nnormal daily activity), injection site swelling, injection site induration, injection site erythema, malaise \nNot known: fever, injection site reactions (including extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, blisters \nat or around the injection site and injection site nodule which may persist for more than one month) \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience of overdose is limited. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible \nsymptomatic treatment is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH09 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nImmunisation with Bexsero is intended to stimulate the production of bactericidal antibodies that \nrecognize the vaccine antigens NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA P1.4 (the immunodominant antigen \npresent in the OMV component) and are expected to be protective against Invasive Meningococcal \nDisease (IMD). As these antigens are variably expressed by different strains, meningococci that \nexpress them at sufficient levels are susceptible to killing by vaccine-elicited antibodies. The \nMeningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) was developed to relate antigen profiles of different \nstrains of meningococcal group B bacteria to killing of the strains in the serum bactericidal assay with \nhuman complement (hSBA). A survey of approximately 1,000 different invasive meningococcal group \nB isolates collected during 2007-2008 in 5 European countries showed that, depending on the country \nof origin, between 73% and 87% of meningococcal group B isolates had an appropriate MATS antigen \nprofile to be covered by the vaccine. Overall, 78% (95% confidence limits from 63-90%) of the \napproximately 1,000 strains were potentially susceptible to vaccine-induced antibodies. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy of Bexsero has not been evaluated through clinical trials. Vaccine efficacy has been \ninferred by demonstrating the induction of serum bactericidal antibody responses to each of the \nvaccine antigens (see section Immunogenicity). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nSerum bactericidal antibody responses to each of the vaccine antigens NadA, fHbp, NHBA and \nPorA P1.4 were evaluated using a set of four meningococcal group B reference strains. Bactericidal \nantibodies against these strains were measured by the Serum Bactericidal Assay using human serum \nas the source of complement (hSBA). Data are not available from all vaccine schedules using the \nreference strain for NHBA. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\n \nMost of the primary immunogenicity studies were conducted as randomized, controlled, multicenter, \nclinical trials. Immunogenicity was evaluated in infants, children, adolescents and adults. \n \nImmunogenicity in infants and children \n \nIn infant studies, participants received three doses of Bexsero either at 2, 4 and 6 or 2, 3 and 4 months \nof age and a booster dose in their second year of life, as early as 12 months of age. Sera were obtained \nboth before vaccination, one month after the third vaccination (see Table 2) and one month after \nbooster vaccination (see Table 3). In an extension study the persistence of the immune response was \nassessed one year after the booster dose (see Table 3). The immunogenicity after two or three doses \nfollowed by a booster has been evaluated in infants 2 months to 5 months of age in another clinical \nstudy. The immunogenicity after two doses has been also documented in another study in \ninfants 6 months to 8 months of age at enrolment (see Table 4).  \nPreviously unvaccinated children also received two doses in the second year of life, with antibody \npersistence being measured at one year after the second dose (see Table 4). \n \nImmunogenicity in infants 2 months to 5 months of age \n \nThree-dose primary series followed by a booster \n \nImmunogenicity results at one month after three doses of Bexsero administered \nat 2, 3, 4 and 2, 4, 6 months of age are summarised in Table 2. Bactericidal antibody responses one \nmonth after the third vaccination against meningococcal reference strains were high against the fHbp, \nNadA and PorA P1.4 antigens at both Bexsero vaccination schedules. The bactericidal responses \nagainst the NHBA antigen were also high in infants vaccinated at the 2, 4, 6-month schedule, but this \nantigen appeared to be less immunogenic at the 2, 3, 4-month schedule. The clinical consequences of \nthe reduced immunogenicity of the NHBA antigen at this schedule are not known. \n \nTable 2.

The percentages of seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) ranged \nfrom 44% to 100% one month after the second dose and from 55% to 100% one month after the third \ndose. At one month following a booster administered 6 months after the last dose, the percentages of \nseropositive subjects ranged from 87% to 100% for the two-dose schedule, and from 83% to 100% for \nthe three-dose schedule. \n \nAntibody persistence was evaluated in an extension study in children 3 to 4 years of age. Comparable \npercentages of subjects were seropositive at 2 to 3 years after being previously vaccinated with either \ntwo doses followed by a booster of Bexsero (ranging from 35% to 91%) or three doses followed by a \nbooster (ranging from 36% to 84%). In the same study the response to an additional dose administered \n2 to 3 years after the booster was indicative of immunological memory as shown by a robust antibody \nresponse against all Bexsero antigens, ranging from 81% to 100% and from 70% to 99%, respectively. \nThese observations are consistent with adequate priming in infancy with both a two-dose and a three-\ndose primary series followed by a booster of Bexsero. \n \nImmunogenicity in infants 6 to 11 months and children 12 to 23 months of age \n \nThe immunogenicity after two doses administered two months apart in children 6 months to 23 months \nof age has been documented in two studies whose results are summarised in Table 4.

At 1 month following the 2-dose vaccination course, \nthe percentages of subjects with hSBA \u22651:5 in individuals with complement deficiencies and asplenia \nor splenic dysfunction were 87% and 97% for antigen fHbp, 95% and 100% for antigen NadA, 68% \nand 86% for antigen PorA P1.4, 73% and 94% for antigen NHBA, respectively, indicating an immune \nresponse in these immunocompromised subjects. The percentages of healthy subjects with hSBA \u22651:5 \nwere 98% for antigen fHbp, 99% for antigen NadA, 83% for antigen PorA P1.4, and 99% for antigen \nNHBA. \n \nImpact of vaccination on disease incidence \n \nIn the UK, Bexsero was introduced into the national immunisation programme (NIP) in September 2015 \nusing a two-dose schedule in infants (at 2 and 4 months of age) followed by a booster dose (at 12 months \nof age). In this context, Public Health England conducted a 3-year observational study at the national \nlevel covering the entire birth cohort. \nAfter three years of the programme, a statistically significant reduction of 75% [Incidence Rate Ratio \n0.25 (95% CI: 0.19;0.36)] in cases of IMD caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B was observed in \nvaccine-eligible infants, irrespective of the infants\u2019 vaccination status or predicted meningococcal \ngroup B strain coverage.  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBexsero in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of meningococcal \ndisease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity and \nreproductive and developmental toxicity studies. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n 30 \n\nPackage leaflet: information for the user \n \n\nBexsero suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nMeningococcal group B Vaccine (rDNA, component, adsorbed) \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child receive this medicine because it \ncontains important information for you or your child. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Bexsero is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive Bexsero \n3. How to use Bexsero \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Bexsero \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What BEXSERO is and what it is used for \n \nBexsero is a Meningococcal group B Vaccine. \n \nBexsero contains four different components from the surface of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis \ngroup B. \n \nBexsero is given to individuals from 2 months of age and older to help protect against disease caused \nby the Neisseria meningitidis group B bacteria. These bacteria can cause serious, and sometimes \nlife-threatening, infections such as meningitis (inflammation of the covering of the brain and spinal \ncord) and sepsis (blood poisoning). \n \nThe vaccine works by specifically stimulating the body\u2019s natural defense system of the vaccinated \nperson. This results in protection against the disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive BEXSERO \n \nDo NOT use Bexsero \n \n- if you or your child are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nvaccine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child receive Bexsero: \n- if you or your child have a severe infection with a high temperature. If this is the case, then \n\nvaccination will be postponed. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not \nrequire postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. \n\n- if you or your child have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from \nclotting properly, such as treatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants). Talk to your doctor or \nnurse first. \n\n\n\n \n\n 31 \n\n- if you or your child receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as \ncomplement activation, such as eculizumab. Even if you or your child have been vaccinated \nwith Bexsero you or your child remain at increased risk of disease caused by the Neisseria \nmeningitidis group B bacteria. \n\n- if your child was born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy), particularly if they had \nbreathing difficulties. Stopping breathing or irregular breathing for a short time may be more \ncommon in the first three days following vaccination in these babies and they may need special \nmonitoring. \n\n- if you or your child have an allergy to the antibiotic kanamycin. If present, the kanamycin level \nin the vaccine is low. If you or your child may have an allergy to kanamycin, talk to your doctor \nor nurse first. \n\n \nFainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. \nTell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you know that you or your child is allergic to latex. The tip cap of the syringe \nmay contain natural rubber latex. The risk for developing an allergic reaction is very small, but your doctor \nor nurse needs to be aware of your allergy when deciding if you or your child should receive Bexsero. \n \nThere are no data on the use of Bexsero in adults above 50 years of age. There are limited data on the use \nof Bexsero in patients with chronic medical conditions or with weakened immunity. If you or your child \nhave weakened immunity (for example, due to the use of immunosuppressive medications, or HIV \ninfection, or hereditary defects of the body\u2019s natural defence system), it is possible that the effectiveness \nof Bexsero is reduced. \n \nAs with any vaccine, Bexsero may not fully protect all of those who are vaccinated. \n \nOther medicines and Bexsero \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines, or have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nBexsero can be given at the same time as any of the following vaccine components: diphtheria, \ntetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), Haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, hepatitis B, \npneumococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and meningococcus A, C, W, Y. Talk to your \ndoctor or nurse for further information. \n \nWhen given at the same time with other vaccines Bexsero must be given at separate injection sites. \n \nYour doctor or nurse may ask you to give your child medicines that lower fever at the time and after \nBexsero has been given. This will help to reduce some of the side effects of Bexsero. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before Bexsero is given. Your doctor may still recommend that you receive \nBexsero if you are at risk of exposure to meningococcal infection. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nBexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the \neffects mentioned under section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may temporarily affect the ability to drive or \nuse machines. \n \nBexsero contains sodium chloride \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\n \n \n3. How to use BEXSERO \n \nBexsero (0.5 ml) will be given to you or your child by a doctor or nurse. It will be injected into \na muscle, usually the thigh for infants or the upper arm for children, adolescents and adults. \n \nIt is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that you or your child completes \nthe course of injections. \n \nInfants 2 months to 5 months of age at the time of first dose \n \nYour child should receive an initial course of two or three injections of the vaccine followed by \nan additional injection (booster). \n- The first injection should be given no earlier than 2 months of age. \n- If three initial doses are given, the interval between injections should be at least 1 month. \n- If two initial doses are given, the interval between injections should be at least 2 months. \n- A booster will be given between 12 months and 15 months of age after an interval of at least 6 \n\nmonths from the last injection of the initial course.

ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child receive bexsero: - if you or your child have a severe infection with a high temperature. if this is the case, then vaccination will be postponed. the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. - if you or your child have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from clotting properly, such as treatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants). talk to your doctor or nurse first. - if you or your child receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, such as eculizumab. even if you or your child have been vaccinated with bexsero you or your child remain at increased risk of disease caused by the neisseria meningitidis group b bacteria. - if your child was born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy), particularly if they had breathing difficulties. stopping breathing or irregular breathing for a short time may be more common in the first three days following vaccination in these babies and they may need special monitoring. - if you or your child have an allergy to the antibiotic kanamycin. if present, the kanamycin level in the vaccine is low. if you or your child may have an allergy to kanamycin, talk to your doctor or nurse first. fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. tell your doctor or nurse if you know that you or your child is allergic to latex. the tip cap of the syringe may contain natural rubber latex. the risk for developing an allergic reaction is very small, but your doctor or nurse needs to be aware of your allergy when deciding if you or your child should receive bexsero. there are no data on the use of bexsero in adults above 50 years of age. there are limited data on the use of bexsero in patients with chronic medical conditions or with weakened immunity. if you or your child have weakened immunity (for example, due to the use of immunosuppressive medications, or hiv infection, or hereditary defects of the body's natural defence system), it is possible that the effectiveness of bexsero is reduced. as with any vaccine, bexsero may not fully protect all of those who are vaccinated. other medicines and bexsero tell your doctor or nurse if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, or have recently received any other vaccine. bexsero can be given at the same time as any of the following vaccine components: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, hepatitis b, pneumococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and meningococcus a, c, w, y. talk to your doctor or nurse for further information. when given at the same time with other vaccines bexsero must be given at separate injection sites. your doctor or nurse may ask you to give your child medicines that lower fever at the time and after bexsero has been given. this will help to reduce some of the side effects of bexsero. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before bexsero is given. your doctor may still recommend that you receive bexsero if you are at risk of exposure to meningococcal infection. driving and using machines bexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. however, some of the effects mentioned under section 4 \"possible side effects\" may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. bexsero contains sodium chloride this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.",
