NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nElonva 100 micrograms solution for injection\nElonva 150 micrograms solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nElonva 100 micrograms solution for injection\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 100 micrograms of corifollitropin alfa* in 0.5 mL solution for \ninjection.\n\nElonva 150 micrograms solution for injection\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 150 micrograms of corifollitropin alfa* in 0.5 mL solution for \ninjection.\n\n*corifollitropin alfa is a glycoprotein produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by \nrecombinant DNA technology. \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\n\nClear and colourless aqueous solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nElonva is indicated for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS) in combination with a Gonadotropin \nReleasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist for the development of multiple follicles in women \nparticipating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Elonva should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\n\nIn the treatment of women of reproductive age, the dose of Elonva is based on weight and age.\n\n- A single 100-microgram dose is recommended in women who weigh less than or equal to \n60 kilograms and who are 36 years of age or younger.\n\n- A single 150-microgram dose is recommended in women:\n- who weigh more than 60 kilograms, regardless of age.\n- who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who are older than 36 years of age.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nWomen older than 36 years of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not studied.\n\nBody Weight\nLess than 50 kg 50 – 60 kg More than 60 kg\n\nAge\n36 years or \n\nyounger\n100 micrograms 100 micrograms 150 micrograms\n\nOlder than 36 \nyears\n\nNot studied 150 micrograms 150 micrograms\n\nThe recommended doses of Elonva have only been established in a treatment cycle with a GnRH \nantagonist that was administered from stimulation day 5 or day 6 onwards (see sections 4.1, 4.4, and \n5.1).\n\nStimulation day 1:\nElonva should be administered as a single subcutaneous injection, preferably in the abdominal wall, \nduring the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\nStimulation day 5 or 6:\nTreatment with a GnRH antagonist should be started on stimulation day 5 or day 6 depending on the \novarian response, i.e. the number and size of growing follicles. The concurrent determination of serum \noestradiol levels may also be useful. The GnRH antagonist is used to prevent premature Luteinising \nHormone (LH) surges.\n\nStimulation day 8:\nSeven days after the injection with Elonva on stimulation day 1, COS treatment may be continued \nwith daily injections of (recombinant) Follicle Stimulating Hormone [(rec)FSH] until the criterion for \ntriggering final oocyte maturation (3 follicles ≥ 17 mm) has been reached. The daily dose of (rec)FSH \nmay depend on the ovarian response. In normal responders a daily dose of 150 IU (rec)FSH is advised. \nAdministration of (rec)FSH on the day of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) administration can \nbe omitted, depending on the ovarian response. In general, adequate follicular development is \nachieved on average by the ninth day of treatment (range 6 to 18 days).\n\nAs soon as three follicles  17 mm are observed, a single injection of 5,000 up to 10,000 IU hCG is \nadministered the same day or the day thereafter to induce final oocyte maturation. In case of an \nexcessive ovarian response, see the recommendations given in section 4.4 in order to reduce the risk \nfor developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nNo clinical studies have been performed in patients with renal insufficiency. Since the rate of \nelimination of corifollitropin alfa may be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency, the use of \nElonva in these women is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nAlthough data in hepatically impaired patients are not available, hepatic impairment is unlikely to \naffect the elimination of corifollitropin alfa (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of Elonva within the approved indication in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nSubcutaneous injection of Elonva may be carried out by the woman herself or her partner, provided \nthat proper instructions are given by the physician. Self administration of Elonva should only be \nperformed by women who are well-motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, pituitary or hypothalamus.\n Abnormal (not menstrual) vaginal bleeding without a known/diagnosed cause.\n Primary ovarian failure.\n Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries.\n Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.\n Malformations of the reproductive organs incompatible with pregnancy.\n Risk factors for OHSS:\n\no A history of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS).\no A previous COS cycle that resulted in more than 30 follicles  11 mm measured by \n\nultrasound examination.\no A basal antral follicle count > 20.\no Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfertility evaluation before starting treatment\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate. In particular, \nwomen should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, hyperprolactinemia and \npituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given. Medical conditions that \ncontraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment with Elonva.\n\nDosing during the stimulation cycle\n\nElonva is intended for single subcutaneous injection only. Additional injections of Elonva should not \nbe given within the same treatment cycle. (See also section 4.2.)\n\nAfter administration of Elonva, no additional FSH-containing product should be administered prior to \nstimulation day 8 (see also section 4.2).\n\nRenal insufficiency\n\nIn patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency the rate of elimination of corifollitropin \nalfa may be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Therefore, the use of Elonva in these women is not \nrecommended.\n\nNot recommended with a GnRH agonist protocol\n\nThere are limited data on the use of Elonva in combination with a GnRH agonist. Results of a small \nuncontrolled study suggest a higher ovarian response than in combination with a GnRH antagonist. \nTherefore, the use of Elonva is not recommended in combination with a GnRH agonist (see also \nsection 4.2).\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nOHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. Clinical signs and \nsymptoms of mild and moderate OHSS are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, mild to moderate \nenlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Clinical signs and \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nsymptoms of severe OHSS are large ovarian cysts, acute abdominal pain, ascites, pleural effusion, \nhydrothorax, dyspnoea, oliguria, haematological abnormalities and weight gain. In rare instances, \nvenous or arterial thromboembolism may occur in association with OHSS. Transient liver function test \nabnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy \nhave also been reported in association with OHSS.\n\nOHSS may be caused by administration of hCG and by pregnancy (endogenous hCG). Early OHSS \nusually occurs within 10 days after hCG administration and may be associated with an excessive \novarian response to gonadotropin stimulation. Late OHSS occurs more than 10 days after hCG\nadministration, as a consequence of the hormonal changes with pregnancy. Because of the risk of \ndeveloping OHSS, patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after hCG administration.\n\nWomen with known risk factors for a high ovarian response may be especially prone to the \ndevelopment of OHSS following treatment with Elonva. For women having their first cycle of ovarian \nstimulation, for whom risk factors are only partially known, close observation for early signs and \nsymptoms of OHSS is recommended.\n\nFollow current clinical practice for reducing the risk of OHSS during Assisted Reproductive \nTechnology (ART). Adherence to the recommended Elonva dose and treatment regimen and careful \nmonitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce the risk of OHSS. To monitor the risk of OHSS, \nultrasonographic assessments of follicular development should be performed prior to treatment and at \nregular intervals during treatment; the concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be \nuseful. In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in \ndiameter. If OHSS develops, standard and appropriate management of OHSS should be implemented \nand followed.\n\nOvarian torsion\n\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with gonadotropins, including Elonva. Ovarian \ntorsion may be related to other conditions, such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, \npast history of ovarian torsion, and previous or current ovarian cysts. Damage to the ovary due to \nreduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\n\nMultiple pregnancies and births have been reported for all gonadotropin treatments, including Elonva. \nThe woman and her partner should be advised of the potential risks for the mother (pregnancy and \ndelivery complications) and the neonate (low birth weight) before starting treatment. In women \nundergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is mainly related to the number of \nembryos transferred.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nInfertile women undergoing ART have an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies. It is important \nto have early ultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine, and to exclude the possibility of \nextrauterine pregnancy.\n\nCongenital malformations\n\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies.\n\nOvarian and other reproductive system neoplasms\n\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nnot established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\nVascular complications\n\nThromboembolic events, both in association with and separate from OHSS, have been reported \nfollowing treatment with gonadotropins, including Elonva. Intravascular thrombosis, which may \noriginate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the \nextremities. In women with generally recognized risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as a \npersonal or family history, severe obesity or thrombophilia, treatment with gonadotropins may further \nincrease this risk. In these women the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed \nagainst the risks. It should be noted, however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of \nthrombosis.\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies with Elonva and other medicines have been performed. Since corifollitropin alfa \nis not a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes, no metabolic interactions with other medicinal \nproducts are anticipated.\n\nElonva may cause a false positive hCG pregnancy test if the test is administered during the ovarian \nstimulation portion of the ART cycle. This may be due to cross-reactivity of hCG pregnancy tests with \nthe carboxy-terminal peptide of the beta subunit of Elonva.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nIn case of inadvertent exposure to Elonva during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude \nan adverse outcome of pregnancy. In animal studies reproductive toxicity has been observed (see \npreclinical safety data in section 5.3). The use of Elonva during pregnancy is not indicated.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThe use of Elonva during breast-feeding is not indicated.\n\nFertility\n\nElonva is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\nElonva may cause dizziness. Women should be advised that if they feel dizzy, they should not drive or \nuse machines.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment with Elonva in clinical trials\n(N=2,397) are pelvic discomfort (6.0%), OHSS (4.3%, see also section 4.4), headache (4.0%), pelvic \npain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%), fatigue (1.5%), and breast tenderness (1.3%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe table below displays the main adverse reactions in women treated with Elonva in clinical trials \nand post-marketing surveillance according to system organ class and frequency; very common (≥ \n1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), \nvery rare (< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction\n\nImmune system disorders Not known Hypersensitivity reactions, both \nlocal and generalised, including \nrash*\n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon Mood swings\n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\nUncommon Dizziness\n\nVascular disorders Uncommon Hot flush\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea\nUncommon Abdominal distension, \n\nvomiting, diarrhoea, \nconstipation\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nUncommon Back pain\n\nPregnancy, puerperium and \nperinatal conditions\n\nUncommon Abortion spontaneous\n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders\n\nCommon OHSS, pelvic pain, pelvic \ndiscomfort, breast tenderness\n\nUncommon Ovarian torsion, adnexa uteri \npain, premature ovulation, \nbreast pain \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon Fatigue\n\nUncommon Injection site haematoma, \ninjection site pain, irritability\n\nInvestigations Uncommon Alanine aminotransferase \nincreased, aspartate \naminotransferase increased\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications\n\nUncommon Procedural pain\n\n*Adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nIn addition, ectopic pregnancy and multiple gestations have been reported. These are considered to be \nrelated to ART or subsequent pregnancy.\n\nIn rare instances, thromboembolism has been associated with Elonva therapy as with other \ngonadotropins.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nMore than one injection of Elonva within one treatment cycle or too high a dose of Elonva and/or \n(rec)FSH may increase the risk of OHSS (see OHSS in section 4.4).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins,\nATC code: G03GA09\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCorifollitropin alfa is designed as a sustained follicle stimulant with the same pharmacodynamic \nprofile as (rec)FSH, but with a markedly prolonged duration of FSH activity. Due to its ability to \ninitiate and sustain multiple follicular growth for an entire week, a single subcutaneous injection of the \nrecommended dose of Elonva may replace the first seven injections of any daily (rec)FSH preparation \nin a COS treatment cycle. The long duration of FSH activity was achieved by adding the \ncarboxy-terminal peptide of the β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to the β-chain of \nhuman FSH. Corifollitropin alfa does not display any intrinsic LH/hCG activity. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nIn three randomized, double-blind, clinical trials, treatment with a single subcutaneous injection of \nElonva, 100 micrograms (ENSURE study) or 150 micrograms (ENGAGE and PURSUE study), for \nthe first seven days of COS was compared to treatment with a daily dose of 150, 200, or 300 IU of \nrecFSH, respectively. Pituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist (ganirelix acetate injection at a \ndaily dose of 0.25 mg) was used in each of the three clinical trials.\n\nIn the ENSURE study, 396 healthy normal ovulatory women, aged 18 to 36 years with a body weight \nless than or equal to 60 kg, were treated for one cycle with 100 micrograms of Elonva and pituitary \nsuppression with a GnRH antagonist as part of an ART program. The primary efficacy endpoint was \nnumber of oocytes retrieved. The median total duration of stimulation was 9 days for both groups, \nindicating that two days of recFSH were required to complete ovarian stimulation from stimulation \nday 8 onwards (recFSH was given on the day of hCG for this study).\n\nIn the ENGAGE Study, 1,506 healthy normal ovulatory women, aged 18 to 36 years with a body \nweight greater than 60 kg and less than or equal to 90 kg, were treated for one cycle with \n150 micrograms of Elonva and pituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist as part of an ART \nprogram. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were ongoing pregnancy rate and number of oocytes \nretrieved. The median total duration of stimulation was 9 days for both groups, indicating that two \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\ndays of recFSH were required to complete ovarian stimulation from stimulation day 8 onwards \n(recFSH was given on the day of hCG for this study).\n\nIn the PURSUE study, 1,390 healthy normal ovulatory women, aged 35 to 42 years with a body \nweight greater than or equal to 50 kg, were treated for one cycle with 150 micrograms of Elonva and \npituitary suppression with a GnRH antagonist as part of an ART program. The primary efficacy \nendpoint was vital pregnancy rate. The number of oocytes retrieved was a key secondary efficacy \nendpoint. The median total duration of stimulation was 9 days for both groups, indicating that one day \nof recFSH was required to complete ovarian stimulation from stimulation day 8 onwards (no recFSH \nwas given on the day of hCG for this study).\n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved\nIn all three studies, treatment with a single injection of Elonva, 100 or 150 micrograms, for the first \nseven days of COS, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved compared with a daily dose of \nrecFSH. However, the differences were within the predefined equivalence (ENGAGE and ENSURE) \nor non-inferiority (PURSUE) margins.

The rates for congenital malformations (major and minor combined) reported for infants \nborn after an FTET cycle in the PURSUE study follow-up (16.4%) were similar to those reported for \ninfants born after fresh ART cycles in the ENSURE, ENGAGE and PURSUE studies combined \n(16.8%).\n\nImmunogenicity\nOf the 2,511 women treated with Elonva who were evaluated for the formation of post-treatment \nantibodies, four (0.16%) had evidence of antibody formation, including three who had been exposed \nonce to Elonva and one who had been exposed twice to Elonva. In each case, these antibodies were \nnon-neutralizing and did not interfere with the response to stimulation or the normal physiologic \nresponses of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis. Two of these four women became \npregnant during the same treatment cycle in which antibodies were detected, suggesting that the \npresence of non-neutralizing antibodies after stimulation with Elonva is not clinically relevant.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nElonva in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of corifollitropin alfa were evaluated after subcutaneous administration in \nwomen undergoing a COS treatment cycle.\n\nDue to the long elimination half-life, after administration of the recommended dose, serum \nconcentrations of corifollitropin alfa are sufficient to sustain multiple follicular growth for an entire \nweek. This justifies replacement of the first seven injections of daily (rec)FSH with a single \nsubcutaneous injection of Elonva in COS for the development of multiple follicles and pregnancy in \nan ART program (see section 4.2).\n\nBody weight is a determinant of exposure to corifollitropin alfa. Corifollitropin alfa exposure after a \nsingle subcutaneous injection is 665 hours*ng/mL (AUC, 426-1,037 hours*ng/mL1) and is similar \nafter administration of 100 micrograms corifollitropin alfa to women with a body weight less than or \nequal to 60 kilograms and of 150 micrograms corifollitropin alfa to women with a body weight greater \nthan 60 kilograms.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter a single subcutaneous injection of Elonva, the maximum serum concentration of corifollitropin \nalfa is 4.24 ng/mL (2.49-7.21 ng/mL1) and is reached 44 hours (35-57 hours1) postdose. The absolute \nbioavailability is 58% (48-70%1).\n\n                                                     \n1\n\nPredicted range for 90% of subjects.\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nDistribution\n\nDistribution, metabolism and elimination of corifollitropin alfa are very similar to other \ngonadotropins, such as FSH, hCG and LH. After absorption into the blood, corifollitropin alfa is \ndistributed mainly to the ovaries and the kidneys. The steady state volume of distribution is 9.2 L \n(6.5-13.1 L1). Exposure to corifollitropin alfa increases proportionally with dose within the range of \n60 micrograms to 240 micrograms.\n\nElimination\n\nCorifollitropin alfa has an elimination half-life of 70 hours (59-82 hours1) and a clearance of 0.13 L/h \n(0.10-0.18 L/h1). Elimination of corifollitropin alfa predominantly occurs via the kidneys, and the rate \nof elimination may be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Hepatic \nmetabolism contributes to a minor extent to the elimination of corifollitropin alfa.\n\nOther special populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nAlthough data in hepatically impaired patients are not available, hepatic impairment is unlikely to \naffect the pharmacokinetic profile of corifollitropin alfa.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPreclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and safety pharmacology.\n\nReproduction toxicology studies in rats and rabbits indicated that corifollitropin alfa does not \nadversely affect fertility. Administration of corifollitropin alfa to rats and rabbits, prior to and directly \nafter mating, and during early pregnancy, resulted in embryotoxicity. In rabbits, when administered \nprior to mating, teratogenicity has been observed. Both embryotoxicity and teratogenicity are \nconsidered a consequence of the superovulatory state of the animal not able to support a number of \nembryos above a physiological ceiling. The relevance of these findings for the clinical use of Elonva is \nlimited.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Elonva is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Elonva\n3. How to use Elonva\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Elonva\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Elonva is and what it is used for\n\nElonva contains the active ingredient corifollitropin alfa and belongs to the group of medicines called \ngonadotropic hormones. Gonadotropic hormones play an important role in human fertility and \nreproduction. One of these gonadotropic hormones is Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which is\nneeded in women for the growth and development of follicles (small round sacs in your ovaries that \ncontain the eggs).\n\nElonva is used to help achieve pregnancy in women having infertility treatment, such as in vitro \nfertilisation (IVF). IVF involves collecting the eggs from the ovary, fertilising them in the laboratory, \nand transferring the embryos into the uterus a few days later. Elonva causes the growth and \ndevelopment of several follicles at the same time by a controlled stimulation of the ovaries.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Elonva\n\nDo not use Elonva if you:\n- are allergic (hypersensitive) to corifollitropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6)\n- have cancer of the ovary, breast, uterus, or brain (pituitary gland or hypothalamus)\n- have recently had unexpected vaginal bleeding, other than menstrual, without a diagnosed cause\n- have ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian failure\n- have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries\n- have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible\n- have fibroid tumours in the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible\n- have risk factor of OHSS (OHSS is a serious medical problem that can happen when the ovaries \n\nare overly stimulated. See below for further explanation.):\no have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\no have had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\no have previously had a treatment cycle of controlled stimulation of the ovaries that \n\nresulted in the growth of more than 30 follicles with a size of 11 mm or larger\no have a basal antral follicle count (the number of small follicles present in your ovaries at \n\nthe beginning of a menstrual cycle) higher than 20\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor before using Elonva.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nTreatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \n(OHSS). This is a serious medical condition where the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing \nfollicles become larger than normal. In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Therefore, \nclose supervision by your doctor is very important. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor will \ndo ultrasound scans of your ovaries. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. (See also \nsection 4.)\n\nOHSS causes fluid to build up suddenly in your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to \nform. Call your doctor right away if you have:\n- severe abdominal swelling and pain in the stomach area (abdomen)\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- sudden weight gain due to fluid build up\n- diarrhoea\n- decreased urine output\n- trouble breathing\n\nYou may use Elonva only once during the same treatment cycle, otherwise, the chance of having \nOHSS may increase.\n\nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome (OHSS).\n\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the \novary to be cut off. \n\nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you:\n- have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant. \n- have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery.\n- have ever had a twisting of an ovary.\n- have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries.\n\nBlood clot (Thrombosis)\nTreatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva may (just as pregnancy) increase the risk of \nhaving a blood clot (thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel.\n\nBlood clots can cause serious medical conditions, such as:\n- blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus)\n- stroke\n- heart attack \n- blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)\n- a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg.\n\nPlease discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially if:\n- you know you already have an increased chance of having a thrombosis\n- you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis\n- you are severely overweight.\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nMultiple births or birth defects\nThere is an increased chance of having twins or even more than two babies, even when only one \nembryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an increased health risk for both the \nmother and her babies. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of couples with fertility \nproblems (e.g., a woman’s age, certain sperm problems, genetic background of both parents) may also \nbe associated with an increased chance of birth defects.\n\nPregnancy complications\nIf treatment with Elonva results in pregnancy, there is a higher chance of pregnancy outside the uterus \n(an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, your doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to \nexclude the possibility of pregnancy outside the uterus.\n\nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had \ninfertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these \ntumours in infertile women.\n\nOther medical conditions\nIn addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you:\n- have kidney disease.\n- have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems.\n- have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\n- have adrenal glands that are not working properly (adrenocortical insufficiency).\n- have high prolactin levels in the blood (hyperprolactinemia).\n- have any other medical conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or any other long-term \n\ndisease).\n- have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you.\n\nOther medicines and Elonva\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nIf you do a pregnancy test during your infertility treatment with Elonva, the test might wrongly \nsuggest that you are pregnant. Your doctor will advise you at what time you can start performing \npregnancy tests. In case of a positive pregnancy test, contact your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nYou should not use Elonva if you are already pregnant, or think that you might be pregnant, or if you \nare breast-feeding.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nElonva may cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, you should not drive or use machines.\n\nElonva contains sodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to use Elonva\n\nAlways use Elonva exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure.\n\nElonva is used in women having infertility treatment like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). During this \ntreatment, Elonva is used in combination with a medicine (so called GnRH-antagonist) to prevent your \n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\novary from releasing an egg too early. Treatment with the GnRH-antagonist usually starts 5 to 6 days \nafter the injection of Elonva.\n\nThe use of Elonva in combination with a GnRH agonist (another medicine to prevent your ovary from \nreleasing an egg too early) is not recommended.\n\nDose\nIn the treatment of women of reproductive age, the dose of Elonva is based on weight and age.\n\n- A single 100-microgram dose is recommended in women who weigh less than or equal to \n60 kilograms and who are 36 years of age or younger.\n\n- A single 150-microgram dose is recommended in women:\n- who weigh more than 60 kilograms, regardless of age.\n- who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who are older than 36 years of age.\n\nWomen older than 36 years of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not studied.\n\nBody Weight\nLess than 50 kg 50 – 60 kg More than 60 kg\n\nAge\n36 years or \n\nyounger\n100 micrograms 100 micrograms 150 micrograms\n\nOlder than 36 \nyears\n\nNot studied 150 micrograms 150 micrograms\n\nDuring the first seven days after the injection with Elonva, you should not use (recombinant) Follicle \nStimulating Hormone ((rec)FSH). Seven days after the injection of Elonva, your doctor may decide to \ncontinue your stimulation cycle with another gonadotropic hormone, like (rec)FSH. This may be \ncontinued for a few days until enough follicles of adequate size are present. This can be checked by\nultrasound examination. Treatment with (rec)FSH is then stopped and the eggs are matured by giving \nhCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin). The eggs are collected from the ovary 34-36 hours later.\n\nHow Elonva is given\nTreatment with Elonva should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility \nproblems. Elonva must be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) into a skin fold (that you pinch \nbetween your thumb and index finger), preferably just below the navel. The injection may be given by \na healthcare professional (for example a nurse), your partner or yourself, if carefully instructed by \nyour doctor. Always use Elonva exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are unsure. A step-by-step “instructions for use” is given at the end of this \nleaflet.\n\nDo not inject Elonva into a muscle. \n\nElonva is supplied in pre-filled syringes that have an automatic safety system to help prevent needle \nstick injuries after use.\n\nIf you use more Elonva or (rec)FSH than you should\nIf you think you have used more Elonva or (rec)FSH than you should, contact your doctor \nimmediately.\n\nIf you forget to use Elonva\nIf you forgot to inject Elonva on the day you should have, contact your doctor immediately. Do not \ninject Elonva without talking with your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious side effects\n\nA possible complication of treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva is unwanted \noverstimulation of the ovaries. The chance of having this complication can be reduced by carefully \nmonitoring the number of maturing follicles. Your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to\ncarefully monitor the number of maturing follicles. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. \nThe first symptoms of ovarian overstimulation may be noticed as pain in the stomach (abdomen), \nfeeling sick or diarrhoea. Ovarian overstimulation may develop into a medical condition called ovarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be a serious medical problem. In more severe cases \nthis may lead to enlargement of the ovaries, collection of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest (which \nmay cause sudden weight gain due to fluid buildup) or clots in the blood vessels.\nContact your doctor without delay if you have pain in the stomach (abdomen) or any of the other \nsymptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation, even if they occur some days after the injection has been\ngiven.\n\nThe chance of having a side effect is described by the following categories:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 women)\n- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n- Pelvic pain\n- Feeling sick (nausea)\n- Headache\n- Pelvic discomfort\n- Breast tenderness\n- Tiredness (fatigue)\n\nUncommon ( may affect up to 1 in 100 women)\n- Twisting of an ovary (ovarian torsion)\n- Liver enzyme increases\n- Miscarriage\n- Pain after oocyte retrieval\n- Procedural pain\n- Releasing an egg too early (premature ovulation)\n- Abdominal distension\n- Vomiting\n- Diarrhoea\n- Constipation\n- Back pain\n- Breast pain \n- Bruising or pain at the injection site\n- Irritability\n- Mood swings\n- Dizziness\n- Hot flush\n\nNot known (cannot be estimated from available data)\n- Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions, both local and generalised, including rash).\n\nPregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy) and multiple pregnancies have also been reported. \nThese side effects are not considered to be related to the use of Elonva, but to Assisted Reproductive \nTechnology (ART) or subsequent pregnancy.\n\nIn rare instances, blood clots (thrombosis) that formed inside a blood vessel, broke off, and travelled\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\ninside the bloodstream to block another blood vessel (thromboembolism) have been associated with\nElonva therapy as with other gonadotropins.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Elonva\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and outer carton after “EXP” \n(expiry date). The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStorage by the pharmacist\nStore in a refrigerator (2ºC-8°C). Do not freeze.\n\nStorage by the patient\nThere are two options:\n1. Store in a refrigerator (2ºC-8°C). Do not freeze.\n2. Store at or below 25ºC for a period of not more than one month. Make a note of when you start \n\nstoring the product out of the refrigerator, and use it within one month of that date.\n\nKeep the syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\nDo not use Elonva\n- if it has been stored out of the refrigerator for more than one month.\n- if it has been stored out of the refrigerator at a temperature of more than 25ºC.\n- if you notice that the solution is not clear.\n- if you notice that the syringe or the needle is damaged.\n\nDo not throw away an empty or unused syringe via household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment.\n\n6.
