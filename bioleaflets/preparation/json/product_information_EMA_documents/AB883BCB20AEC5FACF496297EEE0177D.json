NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViraferon 1 million IU/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of powder contains 1 million IU of interferon alfa-2b produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml contains 1 million IU of interferon alfa-2b. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nWhite to cream coloured powder.  \nClear and colourless solvent.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 3\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 4\n\nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 5\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 6\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated receipt of \nhuman plasma-derived albumin. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific \nmarkers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of \nviruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or \nemerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThere are no reports of virus transmissions with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Viraferon is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 7\n\n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 8\n\n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women.Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 9\n\neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 12\n\npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 14\n\nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 15\n\na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 16\n\n \nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \n\ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n \n\nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 17\n\n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C.

Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 19\n\n \nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 106 IU/kg/day \nfor 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 23\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 24\n\nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 25\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 26\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated receipt of \nhuman plasma-derived albumin. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific \nmarkers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of \nviruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or \nemerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThere are no reports of virus transmissions with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Viraferon is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 27\n\n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 28\n\n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 29\n\neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 32\n\npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 34\n\nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment.

All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 36\n\n \nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \n\ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n \n\nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 37\n\n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C.

Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 106 IU/kg/day \nfor 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 43\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 44\n\nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 45\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 46\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated receipt of \nhuman plasma-derived albumin. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific \nmarkers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of \nviruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or \nemerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThere are no reports of virus transmissions with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Viraferon is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 47\n\n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 48\n\n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 49\n\neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

events were only common with Viraferon alone \n§See section 4.4 \n \nThese undesirable effects have also been reported with Viraferon alone. \n \nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 52\n\npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 54\n\nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 55\n\na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 56\n\n \nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \n\ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n \n\nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 57\n\n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C.

Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 59\n\n \nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 106 IU/kg/day \nfor 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 63\n\nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 64\n\nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 65\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 66\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated receipt of \nhuman plasma-derived albumin. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific \nmarkers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of \nviruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or \nemerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThere are no reports of virus transmissions with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Viraferon is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 67\n\n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 68\n\n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 69\n\neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 72\n\npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 74\n\nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 75\n\na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 76\n\n \nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \n\ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n \n\nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 77\n\n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 106 IU/kg/day \nfor 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViraferon 3 million IU/0.5 ml solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of Viraferon solution for injection, single dose vial, contains 3 million IU of recombinant interferon \nalfa-2b produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA technology, in 0.5 ml of solution. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 83\n\nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 84\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 85\n\nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 86\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 87\n\n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 88\n\n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 89\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 94\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 95\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 96\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViraferon 5 million IU/0.5 ml solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of Viraferon solution for injection, single dose vial, contains 5 million IU of recombinant interferon \nalfa-2b produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA technology, in 0.5 ml of solution. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 102\n\nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 103\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 104\n\nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 105\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 106\n\n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 107\n\n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 108\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 113\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 114\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 115\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable.

The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViraferon 10 million IU/ml solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of Viraferon solution for injection, single dose vial, contains 10 million IU of recombinant \ninterferon alfa-2b produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA technology, in 1 ml of solution. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 121\n\nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 122\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 123\n\nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 124\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 125\n\n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 126\n\n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 127\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 132\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 133\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 140\n\ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 141\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 142\n\nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 143\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 144\n\n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 145\n\n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 146\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 151\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 152\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 153\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of Viraferon solution for injection, multiple dose vial, contains 25 million IU of recombinant \ninterferon alfa-2b produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA technology, in 2.5 ml of solution. \n \nOne ml of solution contains 10 million IU of interferon alfa-2b. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 159\n\ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 160\n\nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \nViraferon may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 161\n\nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 162\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 163\n\n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 164\n\n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 165\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 170\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance.

Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 172\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour ((see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nMultidose presentations must be for individual patient use only. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 178\n\nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 179\n\n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 180\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 181\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 182\n\nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 183\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 184\n\n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 189\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 190\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 191\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nMultidose presentations must be for individual patient use only. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 197\n\nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 198\n\n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 199\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 200\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 201\n\nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 202\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 203\n\n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n \n\nTable 1.

appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4).  \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 208\n\n \nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 209\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 210\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViraferon 60 million IU solution for injection, multidose pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne cartridge contains 60 million IU of recombinant interferon alfa-2b produced in E.coli by recombinant \nDNA technology, in 1.2 ml. \n \nOne ml contains 50 million IU of interferon alfa-2b. \n \nThe pen is designed to deliver its contents of 60 million IU in doses ranging from 5 to 20 million IU. The pen \nwill deliver a maximum of 12 doses of 5 million IU over a period not to exceed 4 weeks. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \nSolution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B \nviral replication (presence of HBV-DNA and HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nhistologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C:  \nAdult patients:  \nViraferon is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated \ntransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe best way to use Viraferon in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChidren and adolescents: \nViraferon is intended for use, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA. The decision to treat should be made on a case \nby case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and \nfibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of \ntreatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials \n(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. \n \nMultidose presentations must be for individual patient use only. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 216\n\nNot all dosage forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Please make sure to select an \nappropriate dosage form and strength. \n \nIf adverse events develop during the course of treatment with Viraferon for any indication, modify the dosage \nor discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance \ndevelops following adequate dosage adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with Viraferon. \nAt the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dosage regimens \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nChronic Hepatitis B: The recommended dosage is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered \nsubcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months. \n \nThe administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white \nblood cells < 1,500/mm3, granulocytes < 1,000/mm3, thrombocytes < 100,000/mm3). Treatment should be \ndiscontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (< 1,200/mm3), severe neutropaenia (< 750/mm3) or severe \nthrombocytopaenia (< 70,000/mm3). \n \nFor all patients, if no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the \nmaximum tolerated dose), discontinue Viraferon therapy. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: Viraferon is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week \n(every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. \n \nChildren 3 years of age or older and adolescents: Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered \nsubcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution \nadministered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).  \n \n(See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination \ntherapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution \nSPC).  \n \nRelapse patients (adults): \nViraferon is given in combination with ribavirin. \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. \n \nNaïve patients: \nAdults: The efficacy of Viraferon is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. Viraferon should be \ngiven alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. \n \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin: \nBased on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 12 months of treatment, it is \nrecommended that patients be treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. \n \nTreatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit \nnegative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and \nhigh pre-treatment viral load. \n \nOther negative prognostic factors (age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into \naccount in order to extend therapy to 12 months. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who failed to show a virologic response after 6 months of treatment (HCV-\nRNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCV-RNA below lower \nlimit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 217\n\n \nViraferon alone: \nThe optimal duration of therapy with Viraferon alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between \n12 and 18 months is advised. \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated with Viraferon alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point \nHCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative \nHCV-RNA. \n \nChildren and adolescents: The efficacy and safety of Viraferon in combination with ribavirin has been \nstudied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.  \n \nGenotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological \nresponse at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive \nvalue 96 %). Virological response is defined as absence of detectable HCV-RNA at Week 12. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in these patients. \nGenotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nVirological responses after 1 year of treatment and 6 months of follow-up were 36 % for genotype 1 and \n81 % for genotype 2/3/4. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent \n\nmyocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.  \n- Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases. \n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. \n- Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive \n\nagents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. \n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt. \n \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if interferon alfa-2b is to be administered in \ncombination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor all patients: \nPsychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation \nand attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after \ntreatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up periodand in the follow-up period. Among \nchildren and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse \nevents (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour \n(sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha \ninterferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such \nsymptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the \nprescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 218\n\nsymptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with \nViraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: \nIf a treatment with interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and \ntherapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \nwith existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interferon \nalfa-2b have been observed rarely during Viraferon therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the \nmedication and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of \ntreatment. \n \nModerate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dosage regimen, or in some \ncases, termination of Viraferon therapy. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment \nwith Viraferon must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. \n \nHypotension may occur during Viraferon therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive \ntreatment. \n \nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing Viraferon therapy since hypotension related \nto fluid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary. \n \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, \nother causes of persistent fever must be ruled out. \n \nViraferon must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a \nhistory of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to \nketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, \npulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing fever, cough, \ndyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary \ninfiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, \nif appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated \nwith interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with \ncorticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events. \n \nOcular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery \nor vein obstruction have been reported in rare instance after treatment with alpha interferons. All patients \nshould have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, \nor reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with Viraferon, must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during Viraferon therapy are recommended \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of Viraferon should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening \nophthalmological disorders. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 219\n\n \nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients \nfull resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of Viraferon. \n \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current \narrhythmic disorders, who require Viraferon therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that \nthose patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have \nelectrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily \nsupraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of Viraferon \ntherapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. \n \nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nViraferon in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. \n \nPreliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney \ngraft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported. \n \nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha \ninterferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. \nPatients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and \nthe benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, \nMonotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and \ncorticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8). \n \nDiscontinue treatment with Viraferon in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of \ncoagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nChronic Hepatitis C: \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nAll patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. \npatients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. Current \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing \ntreatment. \n \nMonotherapy: Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with Viraferon developed thyroid \nabnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using Viraferon therapy, 2.8 % \npatients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy \nfor thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which Viraferon may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to \ninitiation of Viraferon therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional \ntherapy. Viraferon treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by \nmedication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of Viraferon therapy, a patient develops symptoms \nconsistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, Viraferon treatment may \nbe continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 220\n\nViraferon therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Children and \nadolescents, Thyroid monitoring). \n \nSupplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents \nThyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed \nincrease in TSH. Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of \nViraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the \nnormal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has \nbeen observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient’s thyroid status should be evaluated and \ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence \nof thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nGrowth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth \n(mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of \n13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, \nbased on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile \ndecrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off \ntreatment for more than 1 year. In addition, preclicinal juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, \ndose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3). Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of the combined use of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin should be assessed in young children prior \nto the initiation of therapy. Physicians are advised to monitor the growth of children taking ribavirin in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2b. There are no data on long term effects on growth and development and \non sexual maturation. \n \nHCV/HIV Coinfection: Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy \n(HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding Viraferon \nand ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination \ntherapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia. \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may \nincrease the risk in this patient subset.  \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the \ncombination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have \nregular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory Tests:  \nStandard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, \nelectrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all \npatients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with Viraferon. \n \nDuring treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and \nevery other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during Viraferon therapy to greater than or \nequal to 2 times baseline, Viraferon therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are \nobserved. During ALT flare, liver function tests: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and \nbilirubin must be monitored at two-week intervals. \n \nEffect on fertility: Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 221\n\nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nViraferon. \n \nInteractions between Viraferon and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be \nexercised when administering Viraferon in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. \n \nInterferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy \nwith medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or \naminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be \nmonitored and dosage adjusted if necessary. \n \nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with Viraferon. The aetiology has not been \ndefined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is \nadministered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). \n \n(Also see ribavirin SPC if Viraferon is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with \nchronic hepatitis C). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Viraferon must be \nused with caution in fertile men. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been \nreported in women treated with human leukocyte interferon. \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Viraferon is to be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCombination therapy with ribavirin: Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to \navoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Viraferon in combination with \nribavirin. Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients and their female partners must \neach use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see \nribavirin SPC). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with \nViraferon, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSee ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if Viraferon is to be administered in combination \nwith ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nIn clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (from 6 MIU/m2/week \nin hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m2/week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable \neffects were fever, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Fever and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of \ninterruption or cessation of treatment. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 222\n\n \nIn clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of Viraferon three times a \nweek. In Table 1 the frequency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable effects is presented from \nclinical trials in naïve patients treated for one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse \nreactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ \nsystem classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); rarely (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rarely (<1/10,000); not \nknown. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1.

correlated mostly with pre-\nexisting CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, that may \nbe reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior \nevidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).  \n \nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), \nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies \n(see also section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU \ndaily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and \nplatelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. \nIncrease in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis \nsubjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents – Chronic Hepatitis C \nIn clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse \nevents. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in \nheight (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13 %) \npercentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were \nreported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month \nfollow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric \nadverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection \nsite disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from paediatric clinical trials.  \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following \ncategories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, cytokines and immunomodulators, interferons, interferon \nalfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 \n \nViraferon is a sterile, stable, formulation of highly purified interferon alfa-2b produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of \napproximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered \nplasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. \n \nThe activity of Viraferon is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alfa-2b protein \ncorresponding to 2.6 x l08 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the \nrecombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte \ninterferon established by the World Health Organisation. \n \nThe interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to \n21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic \nand biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. \nThese three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular \nspecies of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interferons have been identified. \nViraferon has been classified as recombinant interferon alfa-2b. \n \nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nHuman interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly \nasymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species \nspecificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type \n1 interferons. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 227\n\nThe results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex \nsequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, \nat least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus \nreplication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as \nenhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative effects in studies employing both animal and \nhuman cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant \nimmunomodulatory activity in vitro. \n \nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact antiviral \nmode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. \nThis action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: \nCurrent clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alfa-2b for 4 to 6 months indicates that \ntherapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. \nIn adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has \nbeen observed. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active \nhepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. \n \nChronic hepatitis C: \nIn adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is \n47 %. Superior efficacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin \n(sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose \n> 10.6 mg/kg, p < 0.01). \n \nAdult patients: Viraferon alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III \nclinical trials in 2,552 interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of \nViraferon used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, \n6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a \npositive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 100 copies/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with \na histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum \nALT. \n \nViraferon was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with \nribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated for one year. All patients were followed \nfor an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. \nSustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with Viraferon alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (from two studies) are shown in Table 3. \n \nCo-administration of Viraferon with ribavirin increased the efficacy of Viraferon by at least two fold for the \ntreatment of chronic heptatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic \nfactors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of Viraferon + \nribavirin, compared with Viraferon alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benefit of combination \ntherapy with Viraferon + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients \n(genotype 1 and high virus load) (Table 3). \n \nResponse rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received \nViraferon in combination with ribavirin and received ≥ 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 228\n\nresponse 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took < 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in \ntrial C/I98-580).  \n \n\nTable 3 Sustained virologic response rates with Viraferon + ribavirin (one year of \ntreatment) by genotype and viral load \n\n \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nI \nN=503 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC95-132/I95-143 \n\nI/R \nN=505 \n\nC/I98-580 \n \nAll Genotypes \n\n \n16 % \n\n \n41 % \n\n \n47 % \n\n \n \nGenotype 1 \n\n \n9 % \n\n \n29 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \nGenotype 1  \n≤ 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n25 % \n\n \n33 % \n\n \n45 % \n\n \nGenotype 1 \n> 2 million \ncopies/ml \n\n \n3 % \n\n \n27 % \n\n \n\n \n29 % \n\n \nGenotype 2/3 \n\n \n31 % \n\n \n65 % \n\n \n79 % \n\nI Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) \nI/R Viraferon (3 MIU 3 times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Overall, in both studies, patients \nwho received Viraferon plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. \nStudy 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated \nadult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive \neither pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or Viraferon (3 MIU TIW) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a \nrandomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C \nwho were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alfa-2b (100 \nor 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or Viraferon (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a \nfollow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.  \n           \nTable 4 Sustained virological response based on genotype after Viraferon in combination with \n\nribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\n Study 11 Study 22 \n \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b  \n(1.5 µg/kg/ \n\nweek) + \nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) +  \n\nribavirin  \n(800 mg) \n\np \nvaluea \n\npegylated \ninterferon \n\nalfa-2b (100 \nor  \n\n150c µg/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800- \n1,200 mg)d \n\nViraferon  \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\n+ ribavirin \n(800- \n\n1,200 mg)d \np \n\nvalueb \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 229\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype 1, \n\n4 \n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype 2, \n3 \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. \na:  p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. \nb:  p value based on chi-square test. \nc:  subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week pegylated interferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b. \nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg. \n \n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \n \nRelapse patients: A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with \nViraferon monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to \nViraferon increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of Viraferon used alone in the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (< 100 copies/ml \nby PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when \nmeasured 6 months after the end of treatment. \n \nLong-Term efficacy data \nIn a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non pegylated interferon alfa-2b or \nnon pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years \nof long-term follow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study.  \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % \nConfidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %].  \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results \nin long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis \n(including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nClinical trials in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C: \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\nRNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two \nmulticentre trials and received Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day for 1 year \nfollowed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % \nCaucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in \nchildren with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents \nwere similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b \nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nStudy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and \nintramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to \neight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two \nto three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and \n24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in \nbioavailabilities greater than 100 %. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/ml) by the end of the \ninfusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration \nof medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was \napproximately two hours. \n \nUrine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for Viraferon injection and ribavirin \ncapsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized \nin Table 6. The pharmacokinetics of Viraferon and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n\nTable 6.

Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the \nantiviral activity of interferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients \ntreated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost \nall cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. \nIn patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAlthough interferon is generally recognised as being species specific, toxicity studies in animals were \nconducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no \nevidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given \n100 x 106 IU/kg/day for 3 months. \n \nIn studies of interferon use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed \n(see section 4.4). \n \nResults of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats \nor rabbits, nor did it adversely affect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of \ntreated rats. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus \nmonkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2. \nAbortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically \nsignificant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the \nrecommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m2). High doses of other forms of \ninterferons alpha and beta are known to produce dose-related anovulatory and abortifacient effects in rhesus \nmonkeys. \n \nMutagenicity studies with interferon alfa-2b revealed no adverse events. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alfa-\n2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour (see section 4.4 and Rebetol SPC if Viraferon \nis to be administered in combination with ribavirin). \n \n \n6.

BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 277\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 278\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Viraferon \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you \nregularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived albumin. \n \nThis medicine contains human albumin solution as an excipient. When medicines are made from human blood \nor plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include \ncareful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, \nand the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these \nproducts also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging \nviruses or other types of infections. \n \nThere are no reports of virus infections with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Viraferon the name and batch number of the \nproduct are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 279\n\n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. Do \nnot take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, \nand you accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 280\n\n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction to \nViraferon. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects are very \nrare. \n \nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: \n• chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, confusion, \n\ndifficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; seizure \n(convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal thoughts, \nsuicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), \nhallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or urine, severe \nnosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of \ntreatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or your eyesight or \nhearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or mucous membrane. \n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. Your doctor will test your \nblood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry iron \nand oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels. \n \nAt the beginning of treatment with Viraferon, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, fatigue, \nheadache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take paracetamol if \nyou develop these symptoms. \n \nOther side effects that may occur include: \n \nVery commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10 patients):  \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional lability, \ninsomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like reaction, feeling \nof general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood swings, coughing \n(sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe muscle pain, joint pain, \nmusculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased white blood cell count.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon powder for injection; \n- an ampoule of solvent for Viraferon (water for injections 1 ml); \n- a 2 ml syringe; \n- a long needle (for example 0.8 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to \n\nthe Viraferon powder vial; \n- a short needle (for example 0.3 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nReconstituting Viraferon powder for injection \nRemove the protective cap from the Viraferon vial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. \nYou can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. Remove the syringe from the \nwrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the long needle and place it firmly onto the tip of the \nsyringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your \nhand. Tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the \nampoule. Break the top of the ampoule of solvent. Insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw \nthe total amount of solvent. \n \nTo prepare the Viraferon solution insert the needle through the rubber top of the Viraferon vial and gently \nplace the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your \nhands. \nSlowly inject the diluent, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial in order to avoid production \nof air bubbles. Do not aim the stream at the white powder at the bottom of the vial. To dissolve the white \ncontents, swirl the Viraferon vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the syringe needle in the vial, until the \ncontents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. If air bubbles do form, wait until the solution has settled and \nall bubbles have risen to the top of the solution and disappeared before withdrawing your dose from the vial. \nThe solution should be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, it must be stored at \n2°C - 8°C in the refrigerator and used within 24 hours. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon from the reconstituted powder for injection \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon \nreconstituted solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to \ndraw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nHold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle leaving the \nneedle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. Take the short needle and place it firmly onto \nthe tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check for air bubbles in the \nsyringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle \npointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the \nneedle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the reconstituted solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not \nuse if discolouration or particulate matter is present.

The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard.With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. \nPull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if \nnecessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive \nbandage. \nThe vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe \nand needles safely in a closed container. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 287\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 3 million IU/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 288\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 289\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Viraferon \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you \nregularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived albumin. \n \nThis medicine contains human albumin solution as an excipient. When medicines are made from human blood \nor plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include \ncareful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, \nand the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these \nproducts also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging \nviruses or other types of infections. \n \nThere are no reports of virus infections with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Viraferon the name and batch number of the \nproduct are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 290\n\n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. Do \nnot take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, \nand you accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 291\n\n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects.

Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon powder for injection; \n- an ampoule of solvent for Viraferon (water for injections 1 ml); \n- a 2 ml syringe; \n- a long needle (for example 0.8 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to \n\nthe Viraferon powder vial; \n- a short needle (for example 0.3 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nReconstituting Viraferon powder for injection \nRemove the protective cap from the Viraferon vial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. \nYou can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. Remove the syringe from the \nwrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the long needle and place it firmly onto the tip of the \nsyringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your \nhand. Tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the \nampoule. Break the top of the ampoule of solvent. Insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw \nthe total amount of solvent. \n \nTo prepare the Viraferon solution insert the needle through the rubber top of the Viraferon vial and gently \nplace the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your \nhands. \nSlowly inject the diluent, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial in order to avoid production \nof air bubbles. Do not aim the stream at the white powder at the bottom of the vial. To dissolve the white \ncontents, swirl the Viraferon vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the syringe needle in the vial, until the \ncontents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. If air bubbles do form, wait until the solution has settled and \nall bubbles have risen to the top of the solution and disappeared before withdrawing your dose from the vial. \nThe solution should be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, it must be stored at \n2°C - 8°C in the refrigerator and used within 24 hours. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon from the reconstituted powder for injection \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon \nreconstituted solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to \ndraw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nHold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle leaving the \nneedle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. Take the short needle and place it firmly onto \nthe tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check for air bubbles in the \nsyringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle \npointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the \nneedle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the reconstituted solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not \nuse if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 297\n\n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard.With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. \nPull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if \nnecessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive \nbandage. \nThe vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe \nand needles safely in a closed container. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 298\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 5 million IU/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 299\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 300\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Viraferon \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you \nregularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived albumin. \n \nThis medicine contains human albumin solution as an excipient. When medicines are made from human blood \nor plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include \ncareful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, \nand the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these \nproducts also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging \nviruses or other types of infections. \n \nThere are no reports of virus infections with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Viraferon the name and batch number of the \nproduct are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 301\n\n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, and \nyou accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 302\n\n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon powder for injection; \n- an ampoule of solvent for Viraferon (water for injections 1 ml); \n- a 2 ml syringe; \n- a long needle (for example 0.8 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to \n\nthe Viraferon powder vial; \n- a short needle (for example 0.3 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nReconstituting Viraferon powder for injection \nRemove the protective cap from the Viraferon vial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. \nYou can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. Remove the syringe from the \nwrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the long needle and place it firmly onto the tip of the \nsyringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your \nhand. Tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the \nampoule. Break the top of the ampoule of solvent. Insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw \nthe total amount of solvent. \n \nTo prepare the Viraferon solution insert the needle through the rubber top of the Viraferon vial and gently \nplace the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your \nhands. \nSlowly inject the diluent, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial in order to avoid production \nof air bubbles. Do not aim the stream at the white powder at the bottom of the vial. To dissolve the white \ncontents, swirl the Viraferon vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the syringe needle in the vial, until the \ncontents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. If air bubbles do form, wait until the solution has settled and \nall bubbles have risen to the top of the solution and disappeared before withdrawing your dose from the vial. \nThe solution should be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, it must be stored at \n2°C - 8°C in the refrigerator and used within 24 hours. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon from the reconstituted powder for injection \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon \nreconstituted solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to \ndraw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nHold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle leaving the \nneedle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. Take the short needle and place it firmly onto \nthe tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check for air bubbles in the \nsyringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle \npointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the \nneedle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the reconstituted solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not \nuse if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 308\n\n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard.With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. \nPull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if \nnecessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive \nbandage. \nThe vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe \nand needles safely in a closed container. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 309\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 10 million IU/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 310\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 311\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Viraferon \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you \nregularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived albumin. \n \nThis medicine contains human albumin solution as an excipient. When medicines are made from human blood \nor plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include \ncareful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, \nand the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these \nproducts also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging \nviruses or other types of infections. \n \nThere are no reports of virus infections with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Viraferon the name and batch number of the \nproduct are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 312\n\n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. Do \nnot take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, \nand you accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 313\n\n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction to \nViraferon. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects are very \nrare. \n \nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: \n• chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, confusion, \n\ndifficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; seizure \n(convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal thoughts, \nsuicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), \nhallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or urine, severe \nnosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of \ntreatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or your eyesight or \nhearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or mucous membrane. \n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon powder for injection; \n- an ampoule of solvent for Viraferon (water for injections 1 ml); \n- a 2 ml syringe; \n- a long needle (for example 0.8 × 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for injections to \n\nthe Viraferon powder vial; \n- a short needle (for example 0.3 × 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection; \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nReconstituting Viraferon powder for injection \nRemove the protective cap from the Viraferon vial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. \nYou can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject the dose. Remove the syringe from the \nwrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the long needle and place it firmly onto the tip of the \nsyringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your \nhand. Tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the \nampoule. Break the top of the ampoule of solvent. Insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw \nthe total amount of solvent. \n \nTo prepare the Viraferon solution insert the needle through the rubber top of the Viraferon vial and gently \nplace the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your \nhands. \nSlowly inject the diluent, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial in order to avoid production \nof air bubbles. Do not aim the stream at the white powder at the bottom of the vial. To dissolve the white \ncontents, swirl the Viraferon vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the syringe needle in the vial, until the \ncontents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. If air bubbles do form, wait until the solution has settled and \nall bubbles have risen to the top of the solution and disappeared before withdrawing your dose from the vial. \nThe solution should be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, it must be stored at \n2°C - 8°C in the refrigerator and used within 24 hours. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon from the reconstituted powder for injection \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon \nreconstituted solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to \ndraw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nHold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long needle leaving the \nneedle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. Take the short needle and place it firmly onto \nthe tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check for air bubbles in the \nsyringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle \npointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the \nneedle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the reconstituted solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not \nuse if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 319\n\n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard.With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. \nPull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if \nnecessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive \nbandage. \nThe vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe \nand needles safely in a closed container. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 320\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 3 million IU/0.5 ml solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 321\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 322\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 323\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, and \nyou accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day.

Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon solution for injection; \n- a 1 ml syringe; \n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 × 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the Viraferon solution with \na cleansing swab. \nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it \nfirmly onto the tip of the syringe. \nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to \nthe level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. \nHold the Viraferon vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. \nInsert the needle into the vial containing the Viraferon solution and inject air into the vial. \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon solution. \nYour other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as \nprescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the \nplunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push \nup the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the \nneedle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if \ndiscolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small \nbandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is \nbleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. \nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle \nsafely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 329\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 5 million IU/0.5 ml solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 330\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 331\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 332\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, and \nyou accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day.

Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon solution for injection; \n- a 1 ml syringe; \n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 × 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the Viraferon solution with \na cleansing swab. \nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it \nfirmly onto the tip of the syringe. \nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to \nthe level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. \nHold the Viraferon vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. \nInsert the needle into the vial containing the Viraferon solution and inject air into the vial. \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon solution. \nYour other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as \nprescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the \nplunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push \nup the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the \nneedle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if \ndiscolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small \nbandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is \nbleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. \nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle \nsafely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 338\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 10 million IU/ml solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 339\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 340\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 341\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection.

Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon solution for injection; \n- a 2 ml syringe; \n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 × 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the Viraferon solution with \na cleansing swab. \nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it \nfirmly onto the tip of the syringe. \nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to \nthe level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. \nHold the Viraferon vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. \nInsert the needle into the vial containing the Viraferon solution and inject air into the vial. \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon solution. \nYour other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as \nprescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the \nplunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push \nup the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the \nneedle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if \ndiscolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small \nbandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is \nbleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. \nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle \nsafely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 347\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 18 million IU/3 ml solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 348\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 349\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 350\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. Do \nnot take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, \nand you accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction to \nViraferon. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects are very \nrare. \n \nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: \n• chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, confusion, \n\ndifficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; seizure \n(convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal thoughts, \nsuicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), \nhallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or urine, severe \nnosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 351\n\ntreatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or your eyesight or \nhearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or mucous membrane. \n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. Your doctor will test your \nblood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry iron \nand oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels. \n \nAt the beginning of treatment with Viraferon, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, fatigue, \nheadache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take paracetamol if \nyou develop these symptoms. \n \nOther side effects that may occur include: \n \nVery commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10 patients):  \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional lability, \ninsomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like reaction, feeling \nof general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood swings, coughing \n(sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe muscle pain, joint pain, \nmusculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased white blood cell count. Some \nchildren have had a decrease in their rate of growth (height and weight). \n \nCommonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 100 patients, but less than 1 in every 10 patients): \nthirst, dehydration, high blood pressure, migraines, swollen glands, flushing, menstrual problems, \ndecreased sexual drive, vaginal problem, breast pain, pain in testicle, problems with thyroid gland, red \ngums, dry mouth, red or sore mouth or tongue, tooth ache or tooth disorder, herpes simplex (fever blisters), \ntaste change, upset stomach, dyspepsia (heartburn), constipation, enlargement of liver (liver problems, \nsometimes severe), loose stools, bedwetting in children, inflammation of the sinuses, bronchitis, eye pain, \nproblem with your tear ducts, conjunctivitis (“pink eye”), agitation, sleepiness, sleepwalking, problem with \nbehaviour, nervousness, stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, rapid breathing, pale or reddened skin, bruising, \nfingers and toes very sensitive to cold, problem with skin or nails, psoriasis (new or worsened), increased \nsweating, increased need to pass urine, fine shaking movements, decreased sensitivity to touch, arthritis.  \n \nRarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients): \npneumonia \n \nVery rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients): \nlow blood pressure, puffy face, diabetes, leg cramps, back pain, kidney problems, nerve damage, bleeding \ngums, aplastic anaemia. Pure red cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production \nof red blood cells, has been reported. This causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual \ntiredness and a lack of energy. \n \nVery rarely sarcoidosis, (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin \nlesions and swollen glands) has been reported. Loss of consciousness has occurred very rarely, mostly in \nelderly patients treated at high doses. Cases of stroke (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. Check \nwith your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms.  \nPeriodontal (affecting gums) and dental disorders, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, acute \nhypersensitivity reactions including urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, \nlips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing), bronchoconstriction and \nanaphylaxis (a severe, whole-body allergic reaction) have been reported, but their frequency is unknown.  \n \nAdditionally, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, skin \nand the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with Viraferon use. \n \nOther side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon solution for injection; \n- a 1 ml syringe; \n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 × 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the Viraferon solution with \na cleansing swab. \nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it \nfirmly onto the tip of the syringe. \nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to \nthe level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. \nHold the Viraferon vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. \nInsert the needle into the vial containing the Viraferon solution and inject air into the vial. \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon solution. \nYour other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as \nprescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the \nplunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push \nup the plunger slowly back to the correct dose.  \n \nVolume to be withdrawn according to the dose: \n \n\nVolume (ml) Corresponding dose (million IU) using \nViraferon 18 million IU/3 ml solution for \n\ninjection \n\n0.25 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.5 \n\n1 \n\n1.5 \n\n2 \n\n2.5 \n\n3 \n\n1.5 \n\n0.6 \n\n3 \n\n6 \n\n9 \n\n12 \n\n15 \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 356\n\nReplace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your \npalms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if \ndiscolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small \nbandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is \nbleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. \nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle \nsafely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 357\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 25 million IU/2.5 ml solution for injection \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 358\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 359\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 360\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- a vial of Viraferon solution for injection; \n- a 1 ml syringe; \n- a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 × 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. \n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nRemove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when \npreparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the Viraferon solution with \na cleansing swab. \nRemove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it \nfirmly onto the tip of the syringe. \nRemove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to \nthe level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. \nHold the Viraferon vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. \nInsert the needle into the vial containing the Viraferon solution and inject air into the vial. \nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the Viraferon solution. \nYour other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as \nprescribed by your doctor into the syringe. \nRemove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the \nplunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push \nup the plunger slowly back to the correct dose.  \n \nVolume to be withdrawn according to the dose: \n \n\nVolume (ml) Corresponding dose (million IU) using Viraferon \n25 million IU/2.5 ml solution for injection \n\n0.25 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.5 \n\n1 \n\n1.5 \n\n2 \n\n2.5 \n\n2.5 \n\n1 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25 \n\n \nReplace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. \n \nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C.

Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if \ndiscolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. \n \nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. \nChange your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle \nguard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the \nplunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small \nbandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is \nbleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. \nThe vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle \nsafely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 367\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nViraferon, 18 million IU solution for injection, multidose pen \nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. \n- Keep this leaflet.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 368\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 369\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 370\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, and \nyou accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction to \nViraferon. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects are very \nrare. \n \nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: \n• chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, confusion, \n\ndifficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; seizure \n(convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal thoughts, \nsuicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), \nhallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or urine, severe \nnosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 371\n\ntreatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or your eyesight or \nhearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or mucous membrane. \n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. Your doctor will test your \nblood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry iron \nand oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels. \n \nAt the beginning of treatment with Viraferon, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, fatigue, \nheadache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take paracetamol if \nyou develop these symptoms. \n \nOther side effects that may occur include: \n \nVery commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10 patients):  \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional lability, \ninsomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like reaction, feeling \nof general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood swings, coughing \n(sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe muscle pain, joint pain, \nmusculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased white blood cell count.

Pure red cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production \nof red blood cells, has been reported. This causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual \ntiredness and a lack of energy. \n \nVery rarely sarcoidosis, (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin \nlesions and swollen glands) has been reported. Loss of consciousness has occurred very rarely, mostly in \nelderly patients treated at high doses. Cases of stroke (cerebrovascular events) have been reported. Check \nwith your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms.  \nPeriodontal (affecting gums) and dental disorders, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, acute \nhypersensitivity reactions including urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, \nlips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing), bronchoconstriction and \nanaphylaxis (a severe, whole-body allergic reaction) have been reported, but their frequency is unknown.  \n \nAdditionally, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, skin \nand the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with Viraferon use. \n \nOther side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- the Viraferon multidose pen; \n- a needle for subcutaneous injection (provided in the packaging); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. Use the injection needles provided in the packaging only for Viraferon. Use a new \ninjection needle for each dose. Be sure the solution is at room temperature at the time of injection. \n \nDiagrams A and B show you all the different parts of the pen and the injection needle. The most important \nparts to note are as follows: \n \n- The push button scale tells you what dose has been set. \n- The colour coding strip brown and the push button are at the bottom of the pen as it is held cap up. \n- The pen can only be fully capped when the triangle on the cap scale is aligned with the dosage \n\nindicator on the barrel. \n \n\n    \n \n\n \n Diagram A Diagram B \n\nCap \n\nCap \nscale \n\nRubber \nmembrane \n\nDosage \nindicator \n\nPush \nbutton \nscale \n\nNeedle \n\nReservoir \n\nPen barrel \n\nColour \ncoding \n\nPush \nbutton \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 376\n\n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nTake the pen out of the refrigerator about one-half hour before administering the dose so that the solution in \nthe pen is at room temperature when it is injected. \n \nWhen you are ready to give your injection prepare your pen as follows: \n \nCheck that Viraferon, solution for injection, is clear and colourless in appearance prior to use. If it does not \nhave a clear uniform appearance or if it contains any particles, do not use. \n \nPull off the cap of the pen and disinfect the rubber membrane (see Diagram C) with one cleansing swab. \n\n \n \n\nDiagram C \n \nRemove the protective tab from the injection needle. Note that the rear portion of the injection needle is \nrevealed once the protective tab is removed (see Diagram D). \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram D \n \nGently push the injection needle onto the pen as shown in Diagram E. (Notice that the rear portion of the \ninjection needle will pierce through the rubber membrane that you disinfected previously). Now screw the \ninjection needle onto the pen securely by turning it in a clockwise direction (see Diagram F). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n Diagram E Diagram F \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 377\n\nFirst, pull off the outer injection needle cap (Diagram G). Then, pull off the inner injection needle cap \ncarefully, bearing in mind that the injection needle will now be exposed (Diagram H). Keep the outer \ninjection needle cap for later use. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n Diagram G Diagram H \n \nThe pen is now ready to use. Since a small amount of air may collect in the injection needle and reservoir \nduring storage, the next step is to remove any air bubbles. This is called performing the Air-Shot. \n \nHold the Viraferon, solution for injection, multidose pen with the injection needle point upwards. \n \nTap the reservoir with your finger so that any air bubbles rise to the top of the reservoir, just below the \ninjection needle (Diagram I). \n\n \n \n\nDiagram I \n \nHold the pen by the barrel and turn the reservoir in the direction as indicated by the arrow in Diagram J \n(clockwise) until you feel it click. \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram J \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 378\n\nKeeping the pen pointing upwards, press the push button up fully and see if a drop of Viraferon, solution for \ninjection, appears at the injection needle tip (Notice the drop at the tip of injection needle in Diagram K \nbelow). \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram K \n \nIf no drop appears, use a different pen, and return the faulty pen to your provider. \n \nNote: some air may remain in the pen, but this is not important as you have removed the air from the \ninjection needle and the dose will be accurate. \n \nReplace the Viraferon, solution for injection, multidose pen cap with the ‘triangle’ opposite the dosage \nindicator as seen in Diagram L. \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram L \n \nThe pen is now ready to set the dose. For the next step hold the pen in the middle of the barrel. This will \nallow the push button to move freely, ensuring that the correct dose is set. \n \nTo set the required dose, hold the pen horizontally by the barrel with one hand. With the other hand, turn the \ncap in a clockwise direction indicated by the arrow in Diagram M. You will observe the push button rising, \nindicating the dose set.

The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. Change your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. \nWith one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 384\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 385\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 386\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. Do \nnot take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, \nand you accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- the Viraferon multidose pen; \n- a needle for subcutaneous injection (provided in the packaging); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. Use the injection needles provided in the packaging only for Viraferon. Use a new \ninjection needle for each dose. Be sure the solution is at room temperature at the time of injection. \n \nDiagrams A and B show you all the different parts of the pen and the injection needle. The most important \nparts to note are as follows: \n \n- The push button scale tells you what dose has been set. \n- The colour coding strip blue and the push button are at the bottom of the pen as it is held cap up. \n- The pen can only be fully capped when the triangle on the cap scale is aligned with the dosage \n\nindicator on the barrel. \n \n\n    \n \n\n \n Diagram A Diagram B \n\nCap \n\nCap \nscale \n\nRubber \nmembrane \n\nDosage \nindicator \n\nPush \nbutton \nscale \n\nNeedle \n\nReservoir \n\nPen barrel \n\nColour \ncoding \n\nPush \nbutton \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 392\n\n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nTake the pen out of the refrigerator about one-half hour before administering the dose so that the solution in \nthe pen is at room temperature when it is injected. \n \nWhen you are ready to give your injection prepare your pen as follows: \n \nCheck that Viraferon, solution for injection, is clear and colourless in appearance prior to use. If it does not \nhave a clear uniform appearance or if it contains any particles, do not use. \n \nPull off the cap of the pen and disinfect the rubber membrane (see Diagram C) with one cleansing swab. \n\n \n \n\nDiagram C \n \nRemove the protective tab from the injection needle. Note that the rear portion of the injection needle is \nrevealed once the protective tab is removed (see Diagram D). \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram D \n \nGently push the injection needle onto the pen as shown in Diagram E. (Notice that the rear portion of the \ninjection needle will pierce through the rubber membrane that you disinfected previously). Now screw the \ninjection needle onto the pen securely by turning it in a clockwise direction (see Diagram F). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n Diagram E Diagram F \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 393\n\nFirst, pull off the outer injection needle cap (Diagram G). Then, pull off the inner injection needle cap \ncarefully, bearing in mind that the injection needle will now be exposed (Diagram H).

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1.

WHAT VIRAFERON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nViraferon (interferon alfa-2b) modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and \nsevere diseases. Viraferon is used in adult patients for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B or C, which are viral \ninfections of the liver. \n \nViraferon is used in combination with ribavirin in children and adolescents 3 years of age and older who have \npreviously untreated chronic hepatitis C. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERON \n \nDo not use Viraferon \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to interferon or any of the other ingredients of Viraferon. \n- if you have severe heart disease. \n- if you have poor kidney or liver function. \n- if you have advanced decompensated (uncontrolled) liver disease. \n- if you have hepatitis and have been treated recently with medications that suppress the immune system \n\n(other than short-term treatment with cortisone-type medicine). \n- if you have a history of seizures (convulsions). \n- if you have a history of autoimmune disease, or have had an organ transplant and are taking medicine that \n\nsuppresses your immune system (your immune system helps protect you from infection). \n- if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled. \nChildren and adolescents: \n- if you have had serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide. \n \nTake special care with Viraferon \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Pregnancy). \n- if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. The use of interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see “Do not use \nViraferon”) \n\n- if you have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, \ndejection, etc.) while on treatment with Viraferon (see section 4). \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 400\n\n- if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Viraferon. \n- when receiving Viraferon, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with \n\nyour doctor if you think you are getting an infection. \n- if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or any \n\ndifficulty in breathing, tell your doctor. \n- if you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) \n\nwhile on this medication seek medical help immediately. \n- if you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines. \n- if you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the risk \n\nof rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. \n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving Viraferon \nand ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon with ribavirin. You \nshould brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some \npatients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards. \n \nDuring the one year of treatment, many children did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. However, \nduring the 6 months after treatment, this trend was generally reversed, although a few children did not return \nto their previous rate of growth within the first year after completing treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem; if you have a history of breathing \nirregularities or pneumonia, problems with blood clotting, liver condition, thyroid problems, diabetes, or high \nor low blood pressure. \n \nTell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; \nunconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medication Shosaikoto. \n \nUsing other medicines \nViraferon will add to the effects of substances that slow down your nervous system, possibly causing \ndrowsiness. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist about drinking alcoholic beverages, or taking \nsleeping pills, sedatives or strong pain medications.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medication \nyou are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medications may have \nto be adjusted while you are treated with Viraferon. \n\n \nPatients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated \nwith Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the \naddition of Viraferon and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure. Your doctor \nwill monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient \nLeaflet also). Additionally, patients treated with Viraferon and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine \ncould be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Viraferon with food and drink \nWhile being treated with Viraferon, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood \npressure. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 401\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, \ninterferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect on human pregnancy is not known. \nIf you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn \nbaby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \nchance for pregnancy to occur: \n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, \neach month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You and your partner must \neach use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping \ntreatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.  \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. \nThis will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant \nnow but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the \n7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you \nand your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether this product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you \nare taking Viraferon. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of \nribavirin containing medicinal products. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machinery if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VIRAFERON \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Viraferon specifically for you and your current condition; do not share this medicine \nwith anyone else. \n \nYour doctor has determined the exact dosage for administration of Viraferon according to your individual needs. \nThe dosage will vary according to the disease being treated. \n \nIf you are injecting Viraferon yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly \nprovided with the package of medicine you receive. Dosages that are to be administered 3 times a week are best \ngiven every other day. \n \nThe usual starting dose for each condition follows; however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may \nchange your dose based on your specific needs: \n \nChronic hepatitis B: 5 to 10 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin). \n \nChronic hepatitis C: Adults - 3 million IU 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the \nskin) in combination with ribavirin or alone. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents - \n3 million IU/m2 3 times a week (every other day) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with \nribavirin (Please also see ribavirin package leaflet).  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dose of Viraferon alone or in combination with other medicines (e.g. \nribavirin). If you are prescribed Viraferon in combination with another medicine, please refer also to the Package \nLeaflet of the medicine to be used in combination. Your doctor will determine the exact dosage schedule and \nregimen according to your needs. If you have the impression that the effect of Viraferon is too strong or too \nweak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSubcutaneous use: \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 402\n\nViraferon is usually intended for subcutaneous use. This means that Viraferon is injected with a short needle into \nthe fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to \nprepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet \n(see HOW TO SELF INJECT VIRAFERON at the end of the leaflet). \n \nOne dose of Viraferon is given on each scheduled day. Viraferon is given three times a week, every other day, for \nexample on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Interferons may cause unusual tiredness; if you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, or giving it to a child, use it at bedtime. \n \nUse Viraferon exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, and take Viraferon \nfor as long as prescribed. \n \nIf you use more Viraferon than you should \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Viraferon \nIf you are self-administering treatment, or if you are the caregiver of a child taking Viraferon in combination \nwith ribavirin, inject the recommended dose as soon as you remember and continue treatment as usual. Do \nnot take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are scheduled to inject this product every day, \nand you accidentally missed a full day’s dose, continue treatment at the usual dose the following day. Contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist if needed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viraferon can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although not all of \nthese side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. \n \nSome people get depressed when taking Viraferon alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some \ncases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have \nactually committed suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend \nto help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour. \n \nPaediatric Use: Children are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with Viraferon and \nribavirin. Immediately contact the doctor or seek emergency care if they display any unusual behavioural \nsymptoms, feel depressed, or feel they want to harm themselves or others. \n \nIf any of the following side effects happen, stop taking Viraferon and tell your doctor immediately or go to \nthe casualty department at your nearest hospital: \n• swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth, or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing; hives; fainting. \nThese are all very serious side effects. If you have them, you may have had a serious allergic reaction to \nViraferon. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These very serious side effects are very \nrare. \n \nCheck with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: \n• chest pain or persistent and severe cough; irregular or rapid heartbeat; shortness of breath, confusion, \n\ndifficulty remaining alert, numbness or tingling sensation or pain in hands or feet; seizure \n(convulsions); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; altered mental state; suicidal thoughts, \nsuicide attempt, changed behaviour or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), \nhallucinations; severe stomach pain; black or tar like stools; blood in stool or urine, severe \nnosebleed; waxy pallor, high sugar level in blood, fever or chills beginning after a few weeks of \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 403\n\ntreatment, lower back or side pain, difficult urination, problems with your eyes or your eyesight or \nhearing, loss of hearing, severe or painful reddening or sores on your skin or mucous membrane. \n\nThese may signal serious side effects that may need urgent medical attention. Your doctor will test your \nblood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry iron \nand oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels. \n \nAt the beginning of treatment with Viraferon, you may experience a flu-like reaction, with fever, fatigue, \nheadache, muscle ache, joint pain and chills/rigors. Your doctor may recommend that you take paracetamol if \nyou develop these symptoms. \n \nOther side effects that may occur include: \n \nVery commonly reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10 patients):  \npain, swelling and redness or skin damage at site of injection, hair loss, dizziness, changes in appetite, \nstomach or abdominal pains, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), viral infection, depression, emotional lability, \ninsomnia, anxiety, sore throat and painful swallowing, fatigue, chills/rigors, fever, flu-like reaction, feeling \nof general discomfort, headaches, weight loss, vomiting, irritability, weakness, mood swings, coughing \n(sometimes severe), shortness of breath, itching, dry skin, rash, sudden and severe muscle pain, joint pain, \nmusculoskeletal pain, changes in laboratory blood values including decreased white blood cell count.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self-inject Viraferon. Do \nnot attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-\ninjection. \n \nPreparation \nCollect necessary items before you begin: \n- the Viraferon multidose pen; \n- a needle for subcutaneous injection (provided in the packaging); \n- a cleansing swab. \nWash your hands carefully. Use the injection needles provided in the packaging only for Viraferon. Use a new \ninjection needle for each dose. Be sure the solution is at room temperature at the time of injection. \n \nDiagrams A and B show you all the different parts of the pen and the injection needle. The most important \nparts to note are as follows: \n \n- The push button scale tells you what dose has been set. \n- The colour coding strip pink and the push button are at the bottom of the pen as it is held cap up. \n- The pen can only be fully capped when the triangle on the cap scale is aligned with the dosage \n\nindicator on the barrel. \n \n\n    \n \n\n \n Diagram A Diagram B \n\nCap \n\nCap \nscale \n\nRubber \nmembrane \n\nDosage \nindicator \n\nPush \nbutton \nscale \n\nNeedle \n\nReservoir \n\nPen barrel \n\nColour \ncoding \n\nPush \nbutton \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 408\n\n \nMeasuring the dose of Viraferon \nTake the pen out of the refrigerator about one-half hour before administering the dose so that the solution in \nthe pen is at room temperature when it is injected. \n \nWhen you are ready to give your injection prepare your pen as follows: \n \nCheck that Viraferon, solution for injection, is clear and colourless in appearance prior to use. If it does not \nhave a clear uniform appearance or if it contains any particles, do not use. \n \nPull off the cap of the pen and disinfect the rubber membrane (see Diagram C) with one cleansing swab. \n\n \n \n\nDiagram C \n \nRemove the protective tab from the injection needle. Note that the rear portion of the injection needle is \nrevealed once the protective tab is removed (see Diagram D). \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram D \n \nGently push the injection needle onto the pen as shown in Diagram E. (Notice that the rear portion of the \ninjection needle will pierce through the rubber membrane that you disinfected previously). Now screw the \ninjection needle onto the pen securely by turning it in a clockwise direction (see Diagram F). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n Diagram E Diagram F \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 409\n\nFirst, pull off the outer injection needle cap (Diagram G). Then, pull off the inner injection needle cap \ncarefully, bearing in mind that the injection needle will now be exposed (Diagram H). Keep the outer \ninjection needle cap for later use. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n Diagram G Diagram H \n \nThe pen is now ready to use. Since a small amount of air may collect in the injection needle and reservoir \nduring storage, the next step is to remove any air bubbles. This is called performing the Air-Shot. \n \nHold the Viraferon, solution for injection, multidose pen with the injection needle point upwards. \n \nTap the reservoir with your finger so that any air bubbles rise to the top of the reservoir, just below the \ninjection needle (Diagram I). \n\n \n \n\nDiagram I \n \nHold the pen by the barrel and turn the reservoir in the direction as indicated by the arrow in Diagram J \n(clockwise) until you feel it click. \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram J \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 410\n\nKeeping the pen pointing upwards, press the push button up fully and see if a drop of Viraferon, solution for \ninjection, appears at the injection needle tip (Notice the drop at the tip of injection needle in Diagram K \nbelow). \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram K \n \nIf no drop appears, use a different pen, and return the faulty pen to your provider. \n \nNote: some air may remain in the pen, but this is not important as you have removed the air from the \ninjection needle and the dose will be accurate. \n \nReplace the Viraferon, solution for injection, multidose pen cap with the ‘triangle’ opposite the dosage \nindicator as seen in Diagram L. \n \n\n \n \n\nDiagram L \n \nThe pen is now ready to set the dose. For the next step hold the pen in the middle of the barrel. This will \nallow the push button to move freely, ensuring that the correct dose is set. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 411\n\nTo set the required dose, hold the pen horizontally by the barrel with one hand. With the other hand, turn the \ncap in a clockwise direction indicated by the arrow in Diagram M. You will observe the push button rising, \nindicating the dose set. To set the correct dose, turn the cap as many times as indicated as follows: \n \n\nNumber of “turns” and \n“clicks” \n\nCorresponding doses (million IU) using \nViraferon, solution for injection, multidose pen \n\n60 million IU/pen: \n\n \n\n1  full turn (5 clicks) \n\n6 clicks \n\n7 clicks \n\n8 clicks \n\n9 clicks \n\n2 full turns (10 clicks) \n\n11 clicks \n\n12 clicks \n\n13 clicks \n\n14 clicks \n\n3 full turns (15 clicks) \n\n16 clicks \n\n17 clicks \n\n18 clicks \n\n19 clicks \n\n4 full turns (20 clicks)* \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nDiagram M \n\n*4  full turns correspond to the maximum dose to be administered in one injection. The pen is designed to deliver its contents of \n60 million IU in doses ranging from 5 to 20 million IU. The pen will deliver a maximum of 12 doses of 5 million IU over a period not \nto exceed 4 weeks. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 412\n\nThe push button scale will show you the dose set (see Diagram N below). For doses corresponding to full \nturns, the scale should line up with the correct dose marking. For doses corresponding to clicks intermediate \nbetween full turns, the scale should line up between the two appropriate full-turn dose markings. At that point \ncheck that you have the correct dose. \n \n\n \nDiagram N \n\n \nAfter each complete turn make sure that the triangle is opposite the dosage indicator (see Diagram O). If you \nhave set a wrong dose, simply turn the cap back (anti-clockwise) as far as you can until the push button is \nfully home and start again. Once the correct dose is set you are ready to give the injection. \n\n \nDiagram O \n\nInjecting the solution \nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle: \nthigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), \nabdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of \nthe arm for injection. Change your injection site each time. \n \nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. \nWith one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand, pick up the pen and hold it as you would a \npencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45°. \n \nThen press the push button down fully (see Diagram P). \n\n \nDiagram P \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 413\n\nKeeping the push button down, leave the injection needle in place for a few seconds to allow the Viraferon, \nsolution for injection, to distribute under the skin, then remove. \n \nCarefully replace the outer injection needle cap (See Diagram Q). \n \n\n \nDiagram Q \n\n \nCompletely unscrew the injection needle assembly using an anti-clockwise turning motion as shown in \nDiagram R.
