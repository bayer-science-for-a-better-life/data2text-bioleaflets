PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\nClear and colourless to slightly yellow solution.\nThe pH is between 7 and 8 and osmolality is between 300 and 500 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nReversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults.\n\nFor the paediatric population: sugammadex is only recommended for routine reversal of rocuronium \ninduced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nSugammadex should only be administered by, or under the supervision of an anaesthetist. \nThe use of an appropriate neuromuscular monitoring technique is recommended to monitor the \nrecovery of neuromuscular blockade (see section 4.4). \nThe recommended dose of sugammadex depends on the level of neuromuscular blockade to be \nreversed.\nThe recommended dose does not depend on the anaesthetic regimen.\nSugammadex can be used to reverse different levels of rocuronium or vecuronium induced \nneuromuscular blockade:\n\nAdults\n\nRoutine reversal:\nA dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended if recovery has reached at least 1-2 post-tetanic \ncounts (PTC) following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade. Median time to recovery of the \nT4/T1 ratio to 0.9 is around 3 minutes (see section 5.1).\nA dose of 2 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended, if spontaneous recovery has occurred up to at least \nthe reappearance of T2 following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade. Median time to \nrecovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 is around 2 minutes (see section 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nUsing the recommended doses for routine reversal will result in a slightly faster median time to \nrecovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 of rocuronium when compared to vecuronium induced \nneuromuscular blockade (see section 5.1).\n\nImmediate reversal of rocuronium-induced blockade:\nIf there is a clinical need for immediate reversal following administration of rocuronium a dose of \n16 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended. When 16 mg/kg sugammadex is administered 3 minutes after \na bolus dose of 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium bromide, a median time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 of \napproximately 1.5 minutes can be expected (see section 5.1).\nThere is no data to recommend the use of sugammadex for immediate reversal following vecuronium \ninduced blockade.\n\nRe-administration of sugammadex:\nIn the exceptional situation of recurrence of neuromuscular blockade post-operatively (see section 4.4) \nafter an initial dose of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex, a repeat dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex is \nrecommended. Following a second dose of sugammadex, the patient should be closely monitored to \nascertain sustained return of neuromuscular function.\n\nRe-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after sugammadex: \nFor waiting times for re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after reversal with sugammadex, \nsee section 4.4. \n\nAdditional information on special population\n\nRenal impairment:\nThe use of sugammadex in patients with severe renal impairment (including patients requiring dialysis \n(CrCl < 30 mL/min)) is not recommended (see section 4.4).\nStudies in patients with severe renal impairment do not provide sufficient safety information to \nsupport the use of sugammadex in these patients (see also section 5.1).\nFor mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 30 and < 80 mL/min): the dose \nrecommendations are the same as for adults without renal impairment.\n\nElderly patients:\nAfter administration of sugammadex at reappearance of T2 following a rocuronium induced blockade, \nthe median time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 in adults (18-64 years) was 2.2 minutes, in elderly \nadults (65-74 years) it was 2.6 minutes and in very elderly adults (75 years or more) it was \n3.6 minutes. Even though the recovery times in elderly tend to be slower, the same dose \nrecommendation as for adults should be followed (see section 4.4).\n\nObese patients:\nIn obese patients, including morbidly obese patients (body mass index \u2265 40 kg/m2), the dose of \nsugammadex should be based on actual body weight. The same dose recommendations as for adults \nshould be followed.\n\nHepatic impairment:\nStudies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Caution should be exercised\nwhen considering the use of sugammadex in patients with severe hepatic impairment or when hepatic \nimpairment is accompanied by coagulopathy (see section 4.4).\nFor mild to moderate hepatic impairment: as sugammadex is mainly excreted renally no dose\nadjustments are required.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe data for the paediatric population are limited (one study only for reversal of rocuronium induced \nblockade at reappearance of T2).\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nChildren and adolescents:\nFor routine reversal of rocuronium induced blockade at reappearance of T2 in children and \nadolescents (2-17 years) 2 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended. \nBridion 100 mg/mL may be diluted to 10 mg/mL to increase the accuracy of dosing in the paediatric \npopulation (see section 6.6).\nOther routine reversal situations have not been investigated and are therefore not recommended until \nfurther data become available.\n\nImmediate reversal in children and adolescents has not been investigated and is therefore not \nrecommended until further data become available.\n\nTerm newborn infants and infants:\nThere is only limited experience with the use of sugammadex in infants (30 days to 2 years), and term \nnewborn infants (less than 30 days) have not been studied. The use of sugammadex in term newborn \ninfants and infants is therefore not recommended until further data become available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nSugammadex should be administered intravenously as a single bolus injection. The bolus injection \nshould be given rapidly, within 10 seconds, into an existing intravenous line (see section 6.6). \nSugammadex has only been administered as a single bolus injection in clinical trials.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAs is normal post-anaesthetic practice following neuromuscular blockade, it is recommended to \nmonitor the patient in the immediate post-operative period for untoward events including recurrence of \nneuromuscular blockade.\n\nMonitoring respiratory function during recovery:\nVentilatory support is mandatory for patients until adequate spontaneous respiration is restored \nfollowing reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Even if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is \ncomplete, other medicinal products used in the peri- and post-operative period could depress \nrespiratory function and therefore ventilatory support might still be required.\nShould neuromuscular blockade reoccur following extubation, adequate ventilation should be\nprovided.\n\nRecurrence of neuromuscular blockade:\nIn clinical studies with subjects treated with rocuronium or vecuronium, where sugammadex was\nadministered using a dose labelled for the depth of neuromuscular blockade, an incidence of 0.20% \nwas observed for recurrence of neuromuscular blockade as based on neuromuscular monitoring or \nclinical evidence. The use of lower than recommended doses may lead to an increased risk of \nrecurrence of neuromuscular blockade after initial reversal and is not recommended (see section 4.2\nand section 4.8).\n\nEffect on haemostasis:\nIn a study in volunteers doses of 4 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of sugammadex resulted in maximum mean \nprolongations of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) by 17 and 22% respectively and \nprothrombin time international normalized ratio [PT(INR)] by 11 and 22% respectively. These limited \nmean aPTT and PT(INR) prolongations were of short duration (\u2264 30 minutes). Based on the clinical \ndata-base (N=3,519) and on a specific study in 1184 patients undergoing hip fracture/major joint \nreplacement surgery there was no clinically relevant effect of sugammadex 4 mg/kg alone or in \ncombination with anticoagulants on the incidence of peri- or post-operative bleeding complications.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nIn in vitro experiments a pharmacodynamic interaction (aPTT and PT prolongation) was noted with \nvitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparinoids, rivaroxaban and \ndabigatran. In patients receiving routine post-operative prophylactic anticoagulation this \npharmacodynamic interaction is not clinically relevant. Caution should be exercised when considering \nthe use of sugammadex in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for a pre-existing or co-\nmorbid condition.\n\nAn increased risk of bleeding cannot be excluded in patients:\n\uf0b7 with hereditary vitamin K dependent clotting factor deficiencies; \n\uf0b7 with pre-existing coagulopathies; \n\uf0b7 on coumarin derivates and at an INR above 3.5; \n\uf0b7 using anticoagulants who receive a dose of 16 mg/kg sugammadex. \nIf there is a medical need to give sugammadex to these patients the anaesthesiologist needs to decide if \nthe benefits outweigh the possible risk of bleeding complications taking into consideration the patients \nhistory of bleeding episodes and type of surgery scheduled. If sugammadex is administered to these \npatients monitoring of haemostasis and coagulation parameters is recommended.\n\nWaiting times for re-administration with neuromuscular blocking agents after reversal with \nsugammadex:\n\nTable 1: Re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after routine reversal (up to 4 mg/kg \nsugammadex):\n\nMinimum waiting time NMBA and dose to be administered\n5 minutes 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium\n4 hours 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium or\n\n0.1 mg/kg vecuronium\n\nThe onset of neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged up to approximately 4 minutes, and the \nduration of neuromuscular blockade may be shortened up to approximately 15 minutes after re-\nadministration of rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg within 30 minutes after sugammadex administration.\n\nBased on PK modelling the recommended waiting time in patients with mild or moderate renal \nimpairment for re-use of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium or 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium after routine reversal with \nsugammadex should be 24 hours. If a shorter waiting time is required, the rocuronium dose for a new \nneuromuscular blockade should be 1.2 mg/kg.\n\nRe-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after immediate reversal (16 mg/kg sugammadex):\nFor the very rare cases where this might be required, a waiting time of 24 hours is suggested.\n\nIf neuromuscular blockade is required before the recommended waiting time has passed, a\nnonsteroidal neuromuscular blocking agent should be used. The onset of a depolarizing \nneuromuscular blocking agent might be slower than expected, because a substantial fraction of \npostjunctional nicotinic receptors can still be occupied by the neuromuscular blocking agent.\n\nRenal impairment:\nSugammadex is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment, including those \nrequiring dialysis (see section 5.1).\n\nLight anaesthesia:\nWhen neuromuscular blockade was reversed intentionally in the middle of anaesthesia in clinical \ntrials, signs of light anaesthesia were noted occasionally (movement, coughing, grimacing and \nsuckling of the tracheal tube).\nIf neuromuscular blockade is reversed, while anaesthesia is continued, additional doses of anaesthetic \nand/or opioid should be given as clinically indicated.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nMarked bradycardia:\nIn rare instances, marked bradycardia has been observed within minutes after the administration of \nsugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Bradycardia may occasionally lead to cardiac \narrest. (See section 4.8.) Patients should be closely monitored for hemodynamic changes during and \nafter reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Treatment with anti-cholinergic agents such as atropine \nshould be administered if clinically significant bradycardia is observed.\n\nHepatic impairment:\nSugammadex is not metabolised nor excreted by the liver; therefore dedicated studies in patients with \nhepatic impairment have not been conducted. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be \ntreated with great caution. In case hepatic impairment is accompanied by coagulopathy see the \ninformation on the effect on haemostasis.\n\nUse in Intensive Care Unit (ICU):\nSugammadex has not been investigated in patients receiving rocuronium or vecuronium in the ICU \nsetting.\n\nUse for reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents other than rocuronium or vecuronium:\nSugammadex should not be used to reverse block induced by nonsteroidal neuromuscular blocking \nagents such as succinylcholine or benzylisoquinolinium compounds.\nSugammadex should not be used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by steroidal\nneuromuscular blocking agents other than rocuronium or vecuronium, since there are no efficacy and \nsafety data for these situations. Limited data are available for reversal of pancuronium induced\nblockade, but it is advised not to use sugammadex in this situation.\n\nDelayed recovery:\nConditions associated with prolonged circulation time such as cardiovascular disease, old age (see \nsection 4.2 for the time to recovery in elderly), or oedematous state (e.g., severe hepatic impairment) \nmay be associated with longer recovery times.\n\nDrug hypersensitivity reactions:\nClinicians should be prepared for the possibility of drug hypersensitivity reactions (including \nanaphylactic reactions) and take the necessary precautions (see section 4.8).\n\nSodium:\nThis medicinal product contains up to 9.7 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe information in this section is based on binding affinity between sugammadex and other medicinal \nproducts, non-clinical experiments, clinical studies and simulations using a model taking into account \nthe pharmacodynamic effect of neuromuscular blocking agents and the pharmacokinetic interaction \nbetween neuromuscular blocking agents and sugammadex. Based on these data, no clinically \nsignificant pharmacodynamic interaction with other medicinal products is expected, with exception of \nthe following:\nFor toremifene and fusidic acid displacement interactions could not be excluded (no clinically relevant \ncapturing interactions are expected).\nFor hormonal contraceptives a clinically relevant capturing interaction could not be excluded (no \ndisplacement interactions are expected).\n\nInteractions potentially affecting the efficacy of sugammadex (displacement interactions):\nDue to the administration of certain medicinal products after sugammadex, theoretically rocuronium \nor vecuronium could be displaced from sugammadex. As a result recurrence of neuromuscular \nblockade might be observed. In this situation the patient must be ventilated. Administration of the \nmedicinal product which caused displacement should be stopped in case of an infusion. In situations \nwhen potential displacement interactions can be anticipated, patients should be carefully monitored for \n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nsigns of recurrence of neuromuscular blockade (approximately up to 15 minutes) after parenteral \nadministration of another medicinal product occurring within a period of 7.5 hours after sugammadex \nadministration.\n\nToremifene:\nFor toremifene, which has a relatively high binding affinity for sugammadex and for which relatively \nhigh plasma concentrations might be present, some displacement of vecuronium or rocuronium from \nthe complex with sugammadex could occur. Clinicians should be aware that the recovery of the T4/T1\nratio to 0.9 could therefore be delayed in patients who have received toremifene on the same day of \nthe operation.\n\nIntravenous administration of fusidic acid:\nThe use of fusidic acid in the pre-operative phase may give some delay in the recovery of the T4/T1\nratio to 0.9. No recurrence of neuromuscular blockade is expected in the post-operative phase, since \nthe infusion rate of fusidic acid is over a period of several hours and the blood levels are cumulative \nover 2-3 days. For re-administration of sugammadex see section 4.2.\n\nInteractions potentially affecting the efficacy of other medicinal products (capturing interactions):\nDue to the administration of sugammadex, certain medicinal products could become less effective due \nto a lowering of the (free) plasma concentrations. If such a situation is observed, the clinician is \nadvised to consider the re-administration of the medicinal product, the administration of a \ntherapeutically equivalent medicinal product (preferably from a different chemical class) and/or non-\npharmacological interventions as appropriate.\n\nHormonal contraceptives:\nThe interaction between 4 mg/kg sugammadex and a progestogen was predicted to lead to a decrease \nin progestogen exposure (34% of AUC) similar to the decrease seen when a daily dose of an oral \ncontraceptive is taken 12 hours too late, which might lead to a reduction in effectiveness. For \noestrogens, the effect is expected to be lower. Therefore the administration of a bolus dose of \nsugammadex is considered to be equivalent to one missed daily dose of oral contraceptive steroids \n(either combined or progestogen only). If sugammadex is administered at the same day as an oral \ncontraceptive is taken reference is made to missed dose advice in the package leaflet of the oral\ncontraceptive. In the case of non-oral hormonal contraceptives, the patient must use an additional non \nhormonal contraceptive method for the next 7 days and refer to the advice in the package leaflet of the\nproduct.\n\nInteractions due to the lasting effect of rocuronium or vecuronium:\nWhen medicinal products which potentiate neuromuscular blockade are used in the post-operative \nperiod special attention should be paid to the possibility of recurrence of neuromuscular blockade. \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of rocuronium or vecuronium for a list of the specific medicinal \nproducts which potentiate neuromuscular blockade. In case recurrence of neuromuscular blockade is \nobserved, the patient may require mechanical ventilation and re-administration of sugammadex (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nInterference with laboratory tests:\nIn general sugammadex does not interfere with laboratory tests, with the possible exception of the \nserum progesterone assay. Interference with this test is observed at sugammadex plasma \nconcentrations of 100 microgram/mL (peak plasma level following 8 mg/kg bolus injection).\n\nIn a study in volunteers doses of 4 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of sugammadex resulted in maximum mean \nprolongations of aPTT by 17 and 22% respectively and of PT(INR) by 11 and 22% respectively. \nThese limited mean aPTT and PT(INR) prolongations were of short duration (\u2264 30 minutes).\nIn in vitro experiments a pharmacodynamic interaction (aPTT and PT prolongation) was noted with \nvitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparinoids, rivaroxaban and \ndabigatran (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nPaediatric population\n\nNo formal interaction studies have been performed. The above mentioned interactions for adults and \nthe warnings in section 4.4 should also be taken into account for the paediatric population.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nFor sugammadex no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonic/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.\nCaution should be exercised when administering sugammadex to pregnant women.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether sugammadex is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of sugammadex in breast milk. Oral absorption of cyclodextrins in general is low and no \neffect on the suckling child is anticipated following a single dose to the breast-feeding woman.\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nsugammadex therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThe effects with sugammadex on human fertility have not been investigated. Animal studies to \nevaluate fertility do not reveal harmful effects.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nBridion has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nBridion is administered concomitantly with neuromuscular blocking agents and anaesthetics in \nsurgical patients. The causality of adverse events is therefore difficult to assess.\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in surgical patients were cough, airway complication \nof anaesthesia, anaesthetic complications, procedural hypotension and procedural complication\n(Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10)). \n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety of sugammadex has been evaluated in 3,519 unique subjects across a pooled phase I-III \nsafety database. The following adverse reactions were reported in placebo controlled trials where \nsubjects received anaesthesia and/or neuromuscular blocking agents (1,078 subject exposures to \nsugammadex versus 544 to placebo):\n[Very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000)]\n\nSystem organ class Frequencies Adverse reactions\n(Preferred terms)\n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Drug hypersensitivity \nreactions (see section 4.4)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCommon Cough\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications\n\nCommon Airway complication of \nanaesthesia\n\nAnaesthetic complication \n(see section 4.4)\n\nProcedural hypotension\n\nProcedural complication\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nDrug hypersensitivity reactions:\nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in some patients and volunteers (for \ninformation on volunteers, see Information on healthy volunteers below). In clinical trials of surgical \npatients these reactions were reported uncommonly and for post-marketing reports the frequency is \nunknown.\nThese reactions varied from isolated skin reactions to serious systemic reactions (i.e. anaphylaxis, \nanaphylactic shock) and have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to sugammadex.\nSymptoms associated with these reactions can include: flushing, urticaria, erythematous rash, (severe) \nhypotension, tachycardia, swelling of tongue, swelling of pharynx, bronchospasm and pulmonary \nobstructive events. Severe hypersensitivity reactions can be fatal.\n\nAirway complication of anaesthesia:\nAirway complications of anaesthesia included bucking against the endotracheal tube, coughing, mild \nbucking, arousal reaction during surgery, coughing during the anaesthetic procedure or during surgery, \nor anaesthetic procedure-related spontaneous breath of patient.\n\nAnaesthetic complication:\nAnaesthetic complications, indicative of the restoration of neuromuscular function, include movement\nof a limb or the body or coughing during the anaesthetic procedure or during surgery, grimacing, or \nsuckling on the endotracheal tube. See section 4.4 light anaesthesia.\n\nProcedural complication:\nProcedural complications included coughing, tachycardia, bradycardia, movement, and increase in \nheart rate.\n\nMarked bradycardia:\nIn post-marketing, isolated cases of marked bradycardia and bradycardia with cardiac arrest have been\nobserved within minutes after administration of sugammadex (see section 4.4).\n\nRecurrence of neuromuscular blockade:\nIn clinical studies with subjects treated with rocuronium or vecuronium, where sugammadex was \nadministered using a dose labelled for the depth of neuromuscular blockade (N=2,022), an incidence \n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nof 0.20% was observed for recurrence of neuromuscular blockade as based on neuromuscular \nmonitoring or clinical evidence (see section 4.4).\n\nInformation on healthy volunteers:\nA randomised, double-blind study examined the incidence of drug hypersensitivity reactions in \nhealthy volunteers given up to 3 doses of placebo (N=76), sugammadex 4 mg/kg (N=151) or \nsugammadex 16 mg/kg (N=148). Reports of suspected hypersensitivity were adjudicated by a blinded \ncommittee. The incidence of adjudicated hypersensitivity was 1.3%, 6.6% and 9.5% in the placebo, \nsugammadex 4 mg/kg and sugammadex 16 mg/kg groups, respectively. There were no reports of \nanaphylaxis after placebo or sugammadex 4 mg/kg. There was a single case of adjudicated \nanaphylaxis after the first dose of sugammadex 16 mg/kg (incidence 0.7%). There was no evidence of \nincreased frequency or severity of hypersensitivity with repeat dosing of sugammadex.\nIn a previous study of similar design, there were three adjudicated cases of anaphylaxis, all after \nsugammadex 16 mg/kg (incidence 2.0%).\nIn the Pooled Phase 1 database, AEs considered common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) or very common (\u2265 1/10)\nand more frequent among subjects treated with sugammadex than in the placebo group, include \ndysgeusia (10.1%), headache (6.7%), nausea (5.6%), urticaria (1.7%), pruritus (1.7%), dizziness \n(1.6%), vomiting (1.2%) and abdominal pain (1.0%).\n\nAdditional information on special populations\n\nPulmonary patients:\nIn post-marketing data and in one dedicated clinical trial in patients with a history of pulmonary \ncomplications, bronchospasm was reported as a possibly related adverse event. As with all patients \nwith a history of pulmonary complications the physician should be aware of the possible occurrence of \nbronchospasm.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nA limited database suggests that the safety profile of sugammadex (up to 4 mg/kg) in paediatric \npatients was similar to that in adults.\n\nMorbidly obese patients\n\nIn one dedicated clinical trial in morbidly obese patients, the adverse reaction profile was generally \nsimilar to the profile in adult patients in pooled Phase 1 to 3 studies (see Table 2).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn clinical studies, 1 case of an accidental overdose with 40 mg/kg was reported without any \nsignificant adverse reactions. In a human tolerance study sugammadex was administered in doses up \nto 96 mg/kg. No dose related adverse events nor serious adverse events were reported. \nSugammadex can be removed using haemodialysis with a high flux filter, but not with a low flux \nfilter. Based upon clinical studies, sugammadex concentrations in plasma are reduced by up to 70%\nafter a 3 to 6-hour dialysis session.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: all other therapeutic products, antidotes, ATC code: V03AB35\n\nMechanism of action:\nSugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin which is a Selective Relaxant Binding Agent. It \nforms a complex with the neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium or vecuronium in plasma and \nthereby reduces the amount of neuromuscular blocking agent available to bind to nicotinic receptors in \nthe neuromuscular junction. This results in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by \nrocuronium or vecuronium.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects:\nSugammadex has been administered in doses ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg in dose response \nstudies of rocuronium induced blockade (0.6, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium bromide with and \nwithout maintenance doses) and vecuronium induced blockade (0.1 mg/kg vecuronium bromide with \nor without maintenance doses) at different time points/depths of blockade. In these studies a clear \ndose-response relationship was observed.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety:\nSugammadex can be administered at several time points after administration of rocuronium or \nvecuronium bromide:\n\nRoutine reversal \u2013 deep neuromuscular blockade:\nIn a pivotal study patients were randomly assigned to the rocuronium or vecuronium group. After the \nlast dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, at 1-2 PTCs, 4 mg/kg sugammadex or 70 mcg/kg neostigmine \nwas administered in a randomised order.

In one study, sugammadex was administered following rocuronium \ninduced blockade at 1-2 PTCs (4 mg/kg; N=68); in the other study, sugammadex was administered at \nreappearance of T2 (2 mg/kg; N=30). Recovery from blockade was modestly longer for patients with \nsevere renal impairment relative to patients without renal impairment. No residual neuromuscular \nblockade or recurrence of neuromuscular blockade was reported for patients with severe renal \nimpairment in these studies.\n\nMorbidly obese patients:\nA trial of 188 patients who were diagnosed as morbidly obese investigated the time to recovery from \nmoderate or deep neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. Patients received \n2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex, as appropriate for level of block, dosed according to either actual \nbody weight or ideal body weight in random, double-blinded fashion. Pooled across depth of block \nand neuromuscular blocking agent, the median time to recover to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio \u2265 0.9 in\npatients dosed by actual body weight (1.8 minutes) was statistically significantly faster (p < 0.0001) \ncompared to patients dosed by ideal body weight (3.3 minutes).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the total sum of non-complex-\nbound and complex-bound concentrations of sugammadex. Pharmacokinetic parameters as clearance \nand volume of distribution are assumed to be the same for non-complex-bound and complex-bound \nsugammadex in anaesthetised subjects.\n\nDistribution:\nThe observed steady-state volume of distribution of sugammadex is approximately 11 to 14 litres in \nadult patients with normal renal function (based on conventional, non-compartmental pharmacokinetic \nanalysis). Neither sugammadex nor the complex of sugammadex and rocuronium binds to plasma \nproteins or erythrocytes, as was shown in vitro using male human plasma and whole blood. \nSugammadex exhibits linear kinetics in the dosage range of 1 to 16 mg/kg when administered as an IV \nbolus dose.\n\nMetabolism:\nIn preclinical and clinical studies no metabolites of sugammadex have been observed and only renal \nexcretion of the unchanged product was observed as the route of elimination.\n\nElimination:\nIn adult anaesthetized patients with normal renal function the elimination half-life (t1/2) of \nsugammadex is about 2 hours and the estimated plasma clearance is about 88 mL/min. A mass balance \nstudy demonstrated that > 90% of the dose was excreted within 24 hours. 96% of the dose was \nexcreted in urine, of which at least 95% could be attributed to unchanged sugammadex. Excretion via \nfaeces or expired air was less than 0.02% of the dose. Administration of sugammadex to healthy \nvolunteers resulted in increased renal elimination of rocuronium in complex.\n\nSpecial populations:\n\nRenal impairment and age:\nIn a pharmacokinetic study comparing patients with severe renal impairment to patients with normal \nrenal function, sugammadex levels in plasma were similar during the first hour after dosing, and \nthereafter the levels decreased faster in the control group. Total exposure to sugammadex was \nprolonged, leading to 17-fold higher exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. Low \nconcentrations of sugammadex are detectable for at least 48 hours post-dose in patients with severe \nrenal insufficiency.\nIn a second study comparing subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment to subjects with \nnormal renal function, sugammadex clearance progressively decreased and t1/2 was progressively \nprolonged with declining renal function. Exposure was 2-fold and 5-fold higher in subjects with \n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nmoderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. Sugammadex concentrations were no longer \ndetectable beyond 7 days post-dose in subjects with severe renal insufficiency.\n\nTable 8: A summary of sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters stratified by age and renal \nfunction is presented below:\n\nSelected patient characteristics Mean Predicted PK parameters (CV%)\n\nDemographics Renal function \nCreatinine clearance \n\n(mL/min)\n\nClearance \n(mL/min)\n\nVolume of \ndistribution at \n\nsteady state (L)\n\nElimination \nhalf-life (hr)\n\nAdult Normal 100 88 (22) 12 2 (21)\n\n40 yrs Impaired Mild 50 51 (22) 13 4 (22)\n\n75 kg Moderate 30 31 (23) 14 6 (23)\n\nSevere 10 9 (22) 14 19 (24)\n\nElderly Normal 80 75 (23) 12 2 (21)\n\n75 yrs Impaired Mild 50 51 (24) 13 3 (22)\n\n75 kg Moderate 30 31 (23) 14 6 (23)\n\nSevere 10 9 (22) 14 19 (23)\n\nAdolescent Normal 95 77 (23) 9 2 (22)\n\n15 yrs Impaired Mild 48 44 (23) 10 3 (22)\n\n56 kg Moderate 29 27 (22) 10 5 (23)\n\nSevere 10 8 (21) 11 17 (23)\n\nChild Normal 51 37 (22) 4 2 (20)\n\n7 yrs Impaired Mild 26 19 (22) 4 3 (22)\n\n23 kg Moderate 15 11 (22) 4 5 (22)\n\nSevere 5 3 (22) 5 20 (25)\nCV=coefficient of variation\n\nGender:\nNo gender differences were observed.\n\nRace:\nIn a study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects no clinically relevant differences in \npharmacokinetic parameters were observed. Limited data does not indicate differences in \npharmacokinetic parameters in Black or African Americans.\n\nBody weight:\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of adult and elderly patients showed no clinically relevant \nrelationship of clearance and volume of distribution with body weight.\n\nObesity:\nIn one clinical study in morbidly obese patients, sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg was dosed \naccording to actual body weight (n=76) or ideal body weight (n=74). Sugammadex exposure increased \nin a dose-dependent, linear manner following administration according to actual body weight or ideal \nbody weight. No clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between \nmorbidly obese patients and the general population.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity potential, and toxicity to reproduction, local \ntolerance or compatibility with blood.\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nSugammadex is rapidly cleared in preclinical species, although residual sugammadex was observed in \nbone and teeth of juvenile rats. Preclinical studies in young adult and mature rats demonstrate that \nsugammadex does not adversely affect tooth colour or bone quality, bone structure, or bone \nmetabolism. Sugammadex has no effects on fracture repair and remodelling of bone.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nBridion 100 mg/mL solution for injection\nsugammadex\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have further questions, ask your anaesthetist or doctor.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your anaesthetist or other doctor. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Bridion is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before Bridion is given\n3. How Bridion is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Bridion\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Bridion is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Bridion is\nBridion contains the active substance sugammadex. Bridion is considered to be a Selective Relaxant \nBinding Agent since it only works with specific muscle relaxants, rocuronium bromide or vecuronium \nbromide.\n\nWhat Bridion is used for\nWhen you have some types of operations, your muscles must be completely relaxed. This makes it \neasier for the surgeon to do the operation. For this, the general anaesthetic you are given includes \nmedicines to make your muscles relax. These are called muscle relaxants, and examples include \nrocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide. Because these medicines also make your breathing\nmuscles relax, you need help to breathe (artificial ventilation) during and after your operation until you \ncan breathe on your own again.\nBridion is used to speed up the recovery of your muscles after an operation to allow you to breathe on \nyour own again earlier. It does this by combining with the rocuronium bromide or vecuronium \nbromide in your body. It can be used in adults whenever rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide\nis used and in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 years) when rocuronium bromide is used for a \nmoderate level of relaxation.\n\n2. What you need to know before Bridion is given\n\nYou should not be given Bridion\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to sugammadex or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\u2192 Tell your anaesthetist if this applies to you.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your anaesthetist before Bridion is given\n\uf0b7 if you have kidney disease or had in the past. This is important as Bridion is removed from your\n\nbody by the kidneys.\n\uf0b7 if you have liver disease or have had it in the past.\n\uf0b7 if you have fluid retention (oedema).\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\n\uf0b7 if you have diseases which are known to give an increased risk of bleeding (disturbances of \nblood clotting) or anticoagulation medication.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for infants less than 2 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Bridion\n\u2192 Tell your anaesthetist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nBridion may affect other medicines or be affected by them.\n\nSome medicines reduce the effect of Bridion\n\u2192 It is especially important that you tell your anaesthetist if you have recently taken:\n\uf0b7 toremifene (used to treat breast cancer).\n\uf0b7 fusidic acid (an antibiotic).\n\nBridion can affect hormonal contraceptives\n\uf0b7 Bridion can make hormonal contraceptives - including the \u2018Pill\u2019, vaginal ring, implants or a \n\nhormonal IntraUterine System (IUS) - less effective because it reduces how much you get of the \nprogestogen hormone. The amount of progestogen lost by using Bridion is about the same as \nmissing one oral contraceptive Pill.\n\n\u2192 If you are taking the Pill on the same day as Bridion is given to you, follow the \ninstructions for a missed dose in the Pill\u2019s package leaflet.\n\u2192 If you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant or \nIUS) you should use an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method (such as a \ncondom) for the next 7 days and follow the advice in the package leaflet.\n\nEffects on blood tests\nIn general, Bridion does not have an effect on laboratory tests. However, it may affect the results of a \nblood test for a hormone called progesterone. Talk to your doctor if your progesterone levels need to \nbe tested on the same day you receive Bridion.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\u2192 Tell your anaesthetist if you are pregnant or might be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.\nYou may still be given Bridion, but you need to discuss it first.\nIt is not known whether sugammadex can pass into breast milk. Your anaesthetist will help you decide \nwhether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to abstain from sugammadex therapy, considering the \nbenefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Bridion to the mother.\n\nDriving and using machines\nBridion has no known influence on your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nBridion contains sodium\nThis medicine contains up to 9.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each mL. \nThis is equivalent to 0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.\n\n3. How Bridion is given\n\nBridion will be given to you by your anaesthetist, or under the care of your anaesthetist.\n\nThe dose\nYour anaesthetist will work out the dose of Bridion you need based on:\n\uf0b7 your weight\n\uf0b7 how much the muscle relaxant medicine is still affecting you.\nThe usual dose is 2-4 mg per kg body weight. A dose of 16 mg/kg can be used in adults if urgent \nrecovery from muscle relaxation is needed.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nThe dose of Bridion for children is 2 mg/kg (children and adolescents between 2-17 years old).\n\nHow Bridion is given\nBridion will be given to you by your anaesthetist. It is given as a single injection through an \nintravenous line.\n\nIf more Bridion is given to you than recommended\nAs your anaesthetist will be monitoring your condition carefully, it is unlikely that you will be given \ntoo much Bridion.

a selective relaxant binding agent since it only works with specific muscle relaxants, rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide. what bridion is used for when you have some types of operations, your muscles must be completely relaxed. this makes it easier for the surgeon to do the operation. for this, the general anaesthetic you are given includes medicines to make your muscles relax. these are called muscle relaxants, and examples include rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide. because these medicines also make your breathing muscles relax, you need help to breathe (artificial ventilation) during and after your operation until you can breathe on your own again. bridion is used to speed up the recovery of your muscles after an operation to allow you to breathe on your own again earlier. it does this by combining with the rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in your body. it can be used in adults whenever rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide is used and in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 years) when rocuronium bromide is used for a moderate level of relaxation.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "bridion", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

kidneys. if you have liver disease or have had it in the past. if you have fluid retention (oedema). if you have diseases which are known to give an increased risk of bleeding (disturbances of blood clotting) or anticoagulation medication. children and adolescents this medicine is not recommended for infants less than 2 years of age. other medicines and bridion \u2192 tell your anaesthetist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. bridion may affect other medicines or be affected by them. some medicines reduce the effect of bridion \u2192 it is especially important that you tell your anaesthetist if you have recently taken: toremifene (used to treat breast cancer). fusidic acid (an antibiotic). bridion can affect hormonal contraceptives bridion can make hormonal contraceptives - including the 'pill', vaginal ring, implants or a hormonal intrauterine system (ius) - less effective because it reduces how much you get of the progestogen hormone. the amount of progestogen lost by using bridion is about the same as missing one oral contraceptive pill. \u2192 if you are taking the pill on the same day as bridion is given to you, follow the instructions for a missed dose in the pill's package leaflet. \u2192 if you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant or ius) you should use an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method (such as a condom) for the next 7 days and follow the advice in the package leaflet. effects on blood tests in general, bridion does not have an effect on laboratory tests. however, it may affect the results of a blood test for a hormone called progesterone. talk to your doctor if your progesterone levels need to be tested on the same day you receive bridion. pregnancy and breast-feeding \u2192 tell your anaesthetist if you are pregnant or might be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding. you may still be given bridion, but you need to discuss it first. it is not known whether sugammadex can pass into breast milk. your anaesthetist will help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to abstain from sugammadex therapy, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of bridion to the mother. driving and using machines bridion has no known influence on your ability to drive and use machines. bridion contains sodium this medicine contains up to 9.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each ml. this is equivalent to 0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.",
