NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLeukoScan 0.31 mg, powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nKit for the preparation of 99mTc-labelled LeukoScan. \n \nEach 3 ml vial contains 0.31 mg sulesomab (IMMU-MN3 murine Fab′-SH antigranulocyte monoclonal \nantibody fragments) for the preparation of 99mTc labelled LeukoScan. The kit does not include the \nradioisotope. \n \nExcipients: \nSucrose (37.8 mg) \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nLeukoScan is indicated for diagnostic imaging for determining the location and extent of \ninfection/inflammation in bone in patients with suspected osteomyelitis, including patients with diabetic \nfoot ulcers. \n \nLeukoScan has not been employed to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell anaemia. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe radiolabelled solution should be administered as an intravenous injection.  After injection, any \nremaining portion of the reconstituted solution should be discarded. \n \nLeukoScan is not recommended for use in children. \n \nFormal studies have not been performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  However, due to the \nlow dose of protein administered and the short half-life of 99mTc, dosage adjustment is probably not \nnecessary in such patients. \n \nRadiopharmaceutical agents should be used only by qualified personnel with appropriate government \nauthorisation for the use and manipulation of radionuclides. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 3\n\nThis radiopharmaceutical may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \ndesignated clinical settings.  Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations \nand/or appropriate licenses of local competent official organisations. \n \nImmediately prior to use, contents of the vial are reconstituted in the unlabeled form to prepare LeukoScan \n[99mTc].  The unreconstituted contents of the vial before radiolabelling are not to be directly administered \nto patients. \n \nFor instructions for preparation see section 6.6. \n \nFor readministration see section 4.4. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nPatients with known allergies or hypersensitivity to mouse proteins.   \n \nPregnancy. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nSafety and diagnostic accuracy in persons under 21 years of age have not been established.  \nAdministration of LeukoScan to young subjects should only be performed after consideration of the \npossible risks and benefits to the individual subject. \n \nRecommended imaging protocol \n \nImmunoscintigraphy should be performed one to eight hours after injection.   \n \nThere was essentially no difference in the detection of the presence or absence of osteomyelitis between \nthe 1-2 hour timepoint and the 5-8 hour timepoint after injection.  This suggests that imaging can be \naccomplished anytime between one and eight hours after injection (at the convenience of the nuclear \nmedicine department and the patient). \n \nPlanar imaging in all views necessary to adequately visualise the affected area at 1-8 h post-injection with \nat least 500 k counts or ten minutes per view should be made.  Image acquisition in analogue and/or \ndigital word-mode and at least a 128 x 128 matrix is recommended. \n \nSingle photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging can also be conducted and may aid in \ndifferentiating osteomyelitis from soft tissue infections.  SPECT acquisition parameters recommended are:  \n60 projections in a 360o step-and-shoot technique, 30 seconds per view in at least a 64 x 64 matrix.  Data \nprocessing by filtered backprojection and reconstruction in three planes (transaxial, coronal, and sagittal) \nis recommended. \n \nInterpretation of the images \n \nWhen a bone scan is positive and imaging with LeukoScan is negative, infection is unlikely.  \nWhen a bone scan is negative, imaging with LeukoScan may rarely show a positive response and this may \nindicate early osteomyelitis. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 4\n\nHypersensitivity \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions are possible whenever mouse protein materials are \nadministered to patients.  Appropriate cardiopulmonary resuscitation facilities and trained personnel \nshould be available for immediate use in the event of an adverse reaction. \n \nHuman Anti-mouse Antibody (HAMA) \n \nIn clinical trials involving over 350 patients, no induction of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) to \nantibody fragments has been observed nor has there been any elevation of HAMA levels in patients with \npre-existing HAMA. \n \nPatients who have previously received murine monoclonal antibody products are more likely to have \nHAMA.  In subjects with HAMA, there may be a greater chance of hypersensitivity reactions and \ndiminished efficacy in imaging. \n \nReadministration \n \nThere are, as yet, limited data on safety following repeated use.  Readministration should only be \nconsidered in patients whose sera are negative for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) elevation in the \nfragment assay.  The overall radiation dose received by the patient over time should also be taken into \naccount. \n \nHAMA titers should be determined before repeated administration of LeukoScan. \n \nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria \n \nLeukoScan is not expected to bind to leukocytes in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nFormal drug interaction studies have not been performed, but no drug interactions have been described to \ndate, including patients receiving antibiotics. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWhen it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of childbearing potential, \ninformation should always be sought about pregnancy.  Any woman who has missed a period should be \nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise.  Where uncertainty exists, it is important that radiation \nexposure should be the minimum consistent with achieving the desired clinical information.  Alternative \ntechniques which do not involve ionising radiation should be considered. \n \nPregnancy \n \nLeukoScan is contraindicated in pregnancy. \n \nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus. \nLeukoScan is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Administration of 750 MBq LeukoScan will give an \nestimated absorbed dose of 4.1 mGy to an embryo or fetus at an early stage. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 5\n\nLactation \n \nBefore administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast feeding, consideration \nshould be given as to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased \nbreast feeding and as to whether the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceutical has been made, \nbearing in mind the secretion of activity in breast milk.  If the administration is considered necessary, \nbreast feeding should be interrupted and the expressed feeds discarded.  It is usual to advise that breast \nfeeding can be restarted when the level in the milk will not result in a radiation dose to the child greater \nthan 1 mSv.  Due to the short six-hour, half-life of 99mTc, a dose of less than 1 mSv in mother’s milk can \nbe expected 24 hours after the administration of LeukoScan [99mTc]. \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe following minor, self-limiting, rare adverse events were reported in the clinical trials and considered \nat least possibly related to LeukoScan:  eosinophilia (3); and facial rash (1).  None of these were \nconsidered serious, and all resolved without sequelae. \n \nPost-marketing experience currently comprises greater than 70,000 vials sold, with two reports of self-\nlimiting allergic reactions. \n \n1. Statistically significant reductions in white blood cell (WBC) count were observed in the controlled \n\nstudies at 24 hours post-injection, from a mean value of 8.9 to a mean value of 8.0 (× 103/mm3), but \nremained within the normal range, and returned to their pre-injection values by the time of the next \nmeasurement at 10 days.  By contrast, in non-infected subjects, transient increases in WBC count \nwere seen 24 hours after LeukoScan administration.  The eosinophil count increased from 2.7% pre-\ninjection to 2.9% at 24 hours post-injection, and to 3.9% at 10 days, with the magnitude of both \nincreases being statistically significant.  The magnitude of these increases were assessed by the \ninvestigators to be of no clinical consequence on an individual patient basis. \n\n \nIt is unknown whether the changes in WBC or eosinophil counts observed, although of no clinical \nsignificance, are due to a transient effect on WBC function.  If so, no inferences concerning the \nunderlying mechanism(s) responsible may be derived from the clinical laboratory results.  However, \nin vitro granulocyte function tests did not show significant changes when the sulesomab was added. \n\n  \n In vitro, a positive binding to lymphocytes up to 2-6% has been shown. The effect on lymphocyte \n\nfunction has not been determined. \n \n2. HAMA: \n No induction of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) reactive with fragment was observed in any \n\npatient administered LeukoScan. \n \n3. For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely benefit.  \n\nThe activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably \nachievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended diagnostic result.  Exposure to ionising \nradiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects.  For \ndiagnostic nuclear medicine investigations, the current evidence suggests that the adverse effects \nwill occur with low frequency because of the low radiation doses incurred. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 6\n\n4. For most diagnostic investigations using a nuclear medicine procedure, the radiation dose delivered \n(effective dose/EDE) is less than 20 mSv.  Higher doses may be justified in some clinical \ncircumstances. \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe maximum amount of LeukoScan [99mTc] that can be administered safely has not been determined.  In \nclinical trials, single doses of 1.0 mg of LeukoScan radiolabelled with 900 ± 200 MBq of 99mTc were \nadministered to 11 patients with various types of infection and there were no adverse reactions at this \ndose. \n \nIn the unlikely event of a radiation overdose being administered with LeukoScan [99mTc], the absorbed \ndose to the patient may be reduced by increased oral or intravenous intake of fluids to promote excretion \nof the radiolabel. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic Radiopharmaceuticals. ATC code: VO4D \n \nAt the concentrations and activities used for diagnostic procedures, LeukoScan does not appear to exert \nany pharmacodynamic effects. \n \nThe antibody (IMMU-MN3) recognizes an antigenic structure shared by a surface glycoprotein (NCA-90) \nof granulocytes and the tumour marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). \n \nIn a single-group, open-label, uncontrolled study of 53 patients with acute or chronic infections of \nunknown origin or extent, doses of LeukoScan from 0.1 mg to 1.0 mg were studied.  There was no dose-\nresponse effect for imaging efficacy (sensitivity or specificity) over antibody doses ranging from 0.1 mg \nto 1.0 mg. \n \nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that LeukoScan has no effect on either up-regulation or down-\nregulation of granulocytes, but LeukoScan does appear to bind more avidly to activated rather than resting \ngranulocytes. \n \nOn the basis of two controlled clinical trials of LeukoScan to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of \nthis product for defining the presence and location of osteomyelitis, in a total of 175 evaluable patients, \nLeukoScan had a sensitivity of 88.2%, a specificity of 65.6%, an accuracy of 76.6%, a positive predictive \nvalue of 70.8%, and a negative predictive value of 85.5%. \n \nIn a subgroup of patients in whom LeukoScan was compared directly to the currently available 111In-\nlabelled (occasionally 99mTc-labelled) autologous white blood cell (WBC) scanning test, LeukoScan \nshowed a statistically significant increase in sensitivity over that achieved by WBC scanning (87.7% vs. \n72.6%, p = 0.003 by McNemar’s Test), with no discernible decrease in specificity as compared to WBC \nimaging (67.1% vs. 69.4%). \n \nThe clinical results indicate that among different presentations of osteomyelitis, LeukoScan can show \ndifferent results.  The product is more sensitive (93.9% vs. 80.6%), but less specific (51.6% vs. 72.9%), in \ndiagnosing osteomyelitis in patients with diabetic foot ulcers than in patients with other sites of long bone \nosteomyelitis.  However, there is an equivalent diagnostic accuracy between these two presentations \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 7\n\n(77.5% vs. 75.8%, respectively).  This difference is perhaps explained by the anatomically and \npathophysiology more complicated clinical setting of osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot, making \ndifferentiation of soft tissue and bone infection more difficult than in other presentations of long bone \nosteomyelitis. \n \nAn evaluation of potential clinical impact of LeukoScan demonstrated that LeukoScan could change \nclinical management in 50.2% or improve clinical outcome in 43.4% of the 175 evaluable patients with \nsuspected osteomyelitis.  In 49.7% of the patients, LeukoScan was presumed to provide clinical benefit \nnot achievable by other available diagnostic imaging methods, with the potential that the diagnosis could \nhave been made by LeukoScan alone in 70.3% of the patients.  These benefits were also accompanied by a \nsubstantial reduction (85.4%) in the number of patients who would require other diagnostic imaging \nprocedures. \n\n \nSince LeukoScan cross-reacts with CEA, it should be borne in mind that it may interact with CEA \nproducing tumours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic studies were performed after the intravenous administration of the product.  At one hour \nafter infusion, the blood level was 34% of baseline, 17% at four hours and 7% of baseline at 24 hours.  \nThe distribution half-life was approximately 1.5 hours; the route of excretion is essentially renal with 41% \nof the radiolabel excreted in urine over the first 24 hours after administration. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nOnly very limited nonclinical studies have been performed with either the labeled or unlabeled agent.  \nThese revealed no remarkable findings.  It should be noted, however, that these studies did not assess \ngenotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, or toxicity to reproduction. \n  \n \n6.

The imaging agent, technetium-99m LeukoScan [technetium-99m \nsulesomab] is formed by reconstitution of the contents of the LeukoScan vial with 0.5 mL sodium chloride \nfor injection followed by the addition of 1100 MBq of sodium pertechnetate [99mTc] in 1 mL of Sodium \nChloride for Injection.  The resulting solution has a pH of 4.5-5.5 and is intended for intravenous use only. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements.  Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with \nthe requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for pharmaceuticals. \n \nReconstituted radiopharmaceuticals should be handled using waterproof gloves, adequate shielding of \nradioactivity, and aseptic technique. Following reconstitution, unused radiopharmaceutical and vial should \nbe handled as radioactive waste and disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nMethod of preparation \n \n1. Obtain 900 ± 200 MBq of freshly eluted 99mTc sodium pertechnetate eluate from any commercial \n\nsource which has been eluted within the past 24 hours.  Using saline injection, bring the final \nvolume of eluate solution to 1.0 ml. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 9\n\n2. Clean the rubber closure of each vial such as with an alcohol wipe.  For reconstitution of \nlyophilised powder, with a sterile disposable syringe add 0.50 ml of saline injection into the \nshielded LeukoScan 3-ml vial. \n\n \n3. Swirl and shake the vial contents gently for 30 seconds to insure dissolution.  Radiolabelling must \n\ntake place immediately after reconstitution of product. \n \n4. Add the prepared eluate into the shielded vial, shake and allow the labelling reaction to proceed for \n\nten minutes.  Total volume in vial equals 1.5 ml. \n \n5. Based on the activity measured in the activity calibrator, withdraw a sufficient amount of the \n\nproduct to provide the desired activity (750-1100 MBq of 99mTc, see Dosage and Administration).  \nLeukoScan [99mTc] can be used after ten minutes and should be used within four hours after \npreparation.  LeukoScan [99mTc] can be stored at room temperature after formulation.  Do not \nrefrigerate after formulation. \n\n \n6. Prior to administration, the solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscoloration, and quality control should be performed (see section 12).  If either are present, the \nproduct should be discarded. \n\n \n \n7. MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nImmunomedics GmbH  \nOtto-Röhm-Straße 69 \nD-64293 Darmstadt  \nGermany \n \n \n8.

WHAT LEUKOSCAN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAn antibody is a natural substance made by the body which binds to foreign substances to help remove \nthem from your body.  You produce many different kinds of antibodies. \n \nLeukoScan (sulesomab) is a special kind of antibody which binds to the surface of certain kinds of blood \ncells called leukocytes.  It is produced in mice and purified so that it can be used in humans.  When it is \ncombined to the radioactive technetium isotope and injected into your vein, it finds an abnormal \naccumulation of white blood cells and attaches to them.  One to eight hours later after the injection you \nwill be placed on a special table and pictures will be taken with standard nuclear cameras.  This helps your \ndoctor make a diagnosis and evaluate the extent of your illness.  The doctor does this by using a special \nimaging camera that reveals areas of radioactivity to see where the infections are located.  This medicine \nis for diagnostic use only. \n \nLeukoScan is used to determine the presence of infections in long bones.  Shortly after mixing the \nLeukoScan with the radioactive technetium isotope, the doctor will inject it into your vein.  One to eight \nhours later you will be placed on a special table and pictures will be taken with standard nuclear cameras \nto see where the infections are located.  \n \nLeukoScan is an antibody fragment which is linked to a radioactive substance called technetium.  \nLeukoScan is used in patients with suspected infection of the bone called osteomyelitis.  The antibody is \nable to bind to the surface of white blood cells which infiltrate the area of infection.  When the radioactive \nantibody binds to the white blood cells, your doctor can determine where the infection is located by using \na special imaging camera that reveals areas of radioactivity.  The doctor can also determine how much \ndisease there is.  This will help the doctor determine whether there is infection in the bone and what kind \nof treatment to use. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 21\n\n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE LEUKOSCAN \n \nYou should not use LeukoScan 0.31 mg, sulesomab,powder for solution for injection \n \n• If you know that you are allergic (hypersensitive) to sulesomab or any protein which comes from a \n\nmouse, tell your doctor.  You must then not be given LeukoScan. \n \nTake special care with LeukoScan \n \n• It is possible to have a serious allergic reaction to LeukoScan.  Therefore, you doctor should keep \n\nyou under close observation for a short time after he has given you this medicine. \n \n• If you have ever received LeukoScan or another product made from a mouse antibody, your doctor \n\nshould take a sample of blood for testing to be sure that you have not developed an allergy to it. \n \n• If the prepared solution of LeukoScan appears discoloured or contains particles, it should not be \n\nused. \n \nUsing other medicines \n \nNo interactions with other medicines have been described to date. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines \nobtained without a prescription. \n \nUsing Leukoscan with food and drink \n \nNo studies effects of food/drink have been performed. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \n \n• You should not be given LeukoScan if you are pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \n• If you are breast feeding, you should stop breast feeding your baby for at least 24 hours after you \n\nhave been given LeukoScan. \n \nUse of radiopharmaceutical agents \n \n• Radiopharmaceutical agents should be used only by qualified personnel with appropriate \n\ngovernment authorisation for the use and manipulation of radionuclides. \n \n• This radiopharmaceutical may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \n\ndesignated clinical settings.  Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and/or appropriate licenses of local competent official organisations. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 22\n\n• Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation \nsafety and pharmaceutical quality requirements.  Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, \ncomplying with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for pharmaceuticals. \n\n \n• After use, the container should be disposed of as radioactive waste. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nImportant information about some ingredients of LeukoScan \n \nIf you have been told that you have an intolerance to some sugars, inform your doctor before you are \ngiven this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE LEUKOSCAN \n \nDosage \n \nYou will receive a single dose of 0.25 mg of LeukoScan.  It will contain the radioactive technetium \nisotope in an amount called 740-1110 MBq.  \n \nMethod and/or route(s) of administration \n \nYour doctor will prepare the LeukoScan and the radioactive isotope technetium in a volume of 1.5 ml.  \n0.25 mg of LeukoScan will be labelled with 740-1110 MBq of technetium.  This material will then be \ninjected into your vein.  This dose of radioactivity is safe and will be gone from the body in about 24 \nhours. \n \nFrequency of administration \n \nLeukoScan is prepared for a single injection.  If your doctor decides to give it to you again after several \nweeks or several months, your blood should be tested first to see if you have developed an allergy to \nLeukoScan. \n \nIf you take more LeukoScan than you should \n \n The maximum amount of LeukoScan that can be administered has not been determined.  Patients have \nbeen given four times the amount you will receive with no adverse reactions. \nIn the unlikely event of the administration of a radiation overdose with LeukoScan, the absorbed dose to \nthe patient may be reduced by increased oral or intravenous intake of fluids to promote excretion of the \nradiolabel. \n \nIf you stop using LeukoScan \n \nLeukoScan is prepared for a single injection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 23\n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, LeukoScan can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSome side effects, although not common, have been reported.  These include a small increase in the \nnumber of certain white blood cells called eosinophils (but without any apparent symptoms) and rash.   \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell \nyour doctor. \n \n5.
