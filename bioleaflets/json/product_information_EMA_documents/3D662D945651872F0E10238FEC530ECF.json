NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nMEPACT 4 mg powder for concentrate for dispersion for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 4 mg mifamurtide*.\nAfter reconstitution, each mL of suspension in the vial contains 0.08 mg mifamurtide. \n\n*fully synthetic analogue of a component of Mycobacterium sp. cell wall. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for dispersion for infusion\n\nWhite to off-white homogeneous cake or powder. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMEPACT is indicated in children, adolescents and young adults for the treatment of high-grade \nresectable non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection. It is \nused in combination with post-operative multi-agent chemotherapy. Safety and efficacy have been \nassessed in studies of patients 2 to 30 years of age at initial diagnosis (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nMifamurtide treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in \nthe diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of mifamurtide for all patients is 2 mg/m2 body surface area. It should be \nadministered as adjuvant therapy following resection: twice weekly at least 3 days apart for \n12 weeks, followed by once-weekly treatments for an additional 24 weeks for a total of \n48 infusions in 36 weeks.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nAdults > 30 years\nNone of the patients treated in the osteosarcoma studies were 65 years or older and in the phase III \nrandomised study, only patients up to the age of 30 years were included. Therefore, there are not \nsufficient data to recommend the use of MEPACT in patients > 30 years of age. \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nThere are no clinically meaningful effects of mild to moderate renal (creatinine clearance \n(CrCL) ≥ 30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B) on the pharmacokinetics of \nmifamurtide; therefore, dose adjustments are not necessary for these patients. However, as the \nvariability in pharmacokinetics of mifamurtide is greater in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(see section 5.2), and safety data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is limited, caution \nwhen administering mifamurtide to patients with moderate hepatic impairment is recommended. \n\n\n\n3\n\nAs no pharmacokinetic data of mifamurtide is available in patients with severe renal or hepatic \nimpairment, caution when administering mifamurtide to these patients is recommended. Continued \nmonitoring of the kidney and liver function is recommended if mifamurtide is used beyond \ncompletion of chemotherapy until all therapy is completed.\n\nPaediatric population < 2 years\nThe safety and efficacy of mifamurtide in children aged 0 to 2 years have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nMEPACT is administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. \n\nMEPACT must not be administered as a bolus injection.\n\nFor further instructions on reconstitution, filtering using the filter provided and dilution of the \nmedicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nConcurrent use with ciclosporin or other calcineurin inhibitors (see section 4.5).\n\nConcurrent use with high-dose non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase \ninhibitors) (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRespiratory distress\n\nIn patients with a history of asthma or other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, consideration \nshould be given to administration of bronchodilators on a prophylactic basis. Two patients with \npre-existing asthma developed mild to moderate respiratory distress associated with the treatment\n(see section 4.8). If a severe respiratory reaction occurs, administration of mifamurtide should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate treatment initiated.\n\nNeutropenia\n\nAdministration of mifamurtide was commonly associated with transient neutropenia, usually when \nused in conjunction with chemotherapy. Episodes of neutropenic fever should be monitored and \nmanaged appropriately. Mifamurtide may be given during periods of neutropenia, but subsequent \nfever attributed to the treatment should be monitored closely. Fever or chills persisting for more \nthan 8 hours after administration of mifamurtide should be evaluated for possible sepsis.\n\nInflammatory response\n\nAssociation of mifamurtide with signs of pronounced inflammatory response, including \npericarditis and pleuritis, was uncommon. It should be used with caution in patients with a history \nof autoimmune, inflammatory or other collagen diseases. During mifamurtide administration, \npatients should be monitored for unusual signs or symptoms, such as arthritis or synovitis, \nsuggestive of uncontrolled inflammatory reactions.\n\nCardiovascular disorders\n\nPatients with a history of venous thrombosis, vasculitis or unstable cardiovascular disorders \nshould be closely monitored during mifamurtide administration. If symptoms are persistent and \n\n\n\n4\n\nworsening, administration should be delayed or discontinued. Haemorrhage was observed in \nanimals at very high doses. These are not expected at the recommended dose, however monitoring \nof clotting parameters after the first dose and once again after several doses is recommended. \n\nAllergic reactions\n\nOccasional allergic reactions have been associated with mifamurtide treatment, including rash, \nshortness of breath and grade 4 hypertension (see section 4.8). It may be difficult to distinguish \nallergic reactions from exaggerated inflammatory responses, but patients should be monitored for \nsigns of allergic reactions.\n\nGastrointestinal toxicity\n\nNausea, vomiting and loss of appetite are very common adverse reactions to mifamurtide (see \nsection 4.8). Gastrointestinal toxicity may be exacerbated when mifamurtide is used in \ncombination with high dose, multi-agent chemotherapy and was associated with an increased use \nof parenteral nutrition.\n\nMEPACT contains sodium\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nLimited studies of the interaction of mifamurtide with chemotherapy have been conducted. \nAlthough these studies are not conclusive, there is no evidence of interference of mifamurtide with \nthe anti-tumour effects of chemotherapy and vice versa. \n\nIt is recommended to separate the administration times of mifamurtide and doxorubicin or other \nlipophilic medicinal products if used in the same chemotherapy regimen. \n\nThe use of mifamurtide concurrently with ciclosporin or other calcineurin inhibitors is \ncontraindicated due to their hypothesised effect on splenic macrophages and mononuclear \nphagocytic function (see section 4.3). \n\nAlso, it has been demonstrated in vitro that high-dose NSAIDs (cyclooxygenase inhibitors) can \nblock the macrophage activating effect of liposomal mifamurtide. Therefore, the use of high-dose \nNSAIDs is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nBecause mifamurtide acts through stimulation of the immune system, the chronic or routine use of \ncorticosteroids should be avoided during treatment with mifamurtide.\n\nIn vitro interaction studies showed that liposomal and non-liposomal mifamurtide do not inhibit \nthe metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 in pooled human liver microsomes. Liposomal and \nnon-liposomal mifamurtide do not induce the metabolic activity or the transcription of cytochrome \nP450 in primary cultures of freshly isolated human hepatocytes. Mifamurtide is, therefore, not \nexpected to interact with the metabolism of substances that are hepatic cytochrome P450 \nsubstrates.\n\nIn a large controlled randomised study, mifamurtide used at the recommended dose and schedule \nwith other medicinal products that have known renal (cisplatin, ifosfamide) or hepatic (high-dose \nmethotrexate, ifosfamide) toxicities did not exacerbate those toxicities and there was no need to \nadjust mifamurtide dose.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of mifamurtide in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient \nwith respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Mifamurtide is not recommended for use during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether mifamurtide is excreted in human milk. The excretion of mifamurtide in \nmilk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy should be made taking into account the benefit \nof breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of mifamurtide therapy to the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nNo dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with mifamurtide (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nMEPACT has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness, vertigo, \nfatigue and blurred vision have shown as very common or common undesirable effects of \nmifamurtide treatment.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nMifamurtide was studied as a single agent in 248 patients with mostly advanced malignancies during \nthe early, single arm phase I and II clinical studies. The most frequent adverse reactions are chills, \npyrexia, fatigue, nausea, tachycardia and headache. Many of the very commonly reported adverse \nreactions as shown in the following summary table are thought to be related to the mechanism of \naction of mifamurtide (see table 1). The majority of these events were reported as either mild or \nmoderate.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are classified according to system organ class and frequency. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1.

In a randomised controlled study, the incidence of myeloid malignancy \n(acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome) was the same in patients receiving \nMEPACT plus chemotherapy as in patients receiving only chemotherapy (2.1%).\n\nMetabolism and nutritional disorders\nAnorexia (21%) was very commonly reported in phase I and II studies of mifamurtide \n\nNervous system disorders\nConsistent with other generalised symptoms, the very common nervous system disorders were \nheadache (50%) and dizziness (17%). One patient in the phase III study experienced 2 episodes of \ngrade 4 seizure while on study therapy with chemotherapy and mifamurtide. The second episode \ninvolved multiple grand mal seizures over the course of days. Mifamurtide treatment was \ncontinued for the remainder of the study without seizure recurrence.\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nAlthough hearing loss may be attributable to ototoxic chemotherapy, like cisplatin, it is unclear \nwhether MEPACT in conjunction with multi-agent chemotherapy may increase hearing loss.\nA higher percentage of objective and subjective hearing loss was observed overall in patients who \nreceived MEPACT and chemotherapy (12% and 4%, respectively) in the phase III study (see \nsection 5.1 for a description of the study) compared to those patients that received only \nchemotherapy (7% and 1%). All patients received a total dose of cisplatin of 480 mg/m2 as part of \ntheir induction (neoadjuvant) and/or maintenance (adjuvant) chemotherapy regimen. \n\nCardiac and vascular disorders\nMild-moderate tachycardia (50%), hypertension (26%) and hypotension (29%) were very\ncommonly reported in uncontrolled studies of mifamurtide. One serious incident of subacute \nthrombosis was reported in early studies, but no serious cardiac events were associated with \nmifamurtide in a large randomised controlled study (see section 4.4).\n\nRespiratory disorders\nRespiratory disorders, including dyspnoea (21%), cough (18%) and tachypnoea (13%) were very \ncommonly reported, and 2 patients with pre-existing asthma developed mild to moderate \nrespiratory distress associated with MEPACT treatment in a phase II study.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal disorders were frequently associated with mifamurtide administration, including \nnausea (57%) and vomiting (44%) in about half of patients, constipation (17%), diarrhoea (13%) \nand abdominal pain (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n8\n\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders\nHyperhidrosis (11%) was very common in patients receiving mifamurtide in uncontrolled studies.\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nLow grade pain was very common in patients receiving mifamurtide, including myalgia (31%), \nback pain (15%), extremity pain (12%) and arthralgia (10%). \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nThe majority of patients experience chills (89%), fever (85%) and fatigue (53%). These are \ntypically mild to moderate, transient in nature and generally respond to palliative treatment (e.g., \nparacetamol for fever). Other generalised symptoms that were typically mild to moderate and very \ncommon included hypothermia (23%), malaise (13%), pain (15%), asthenia (13%) and chest pain \n(11%). Oedema, chest discomfort, local infusion or catheter site reactions and ‘feeling cold’ were \nless frequently reported in these patients, mostly with late stage malignant disease.\n\nInvestigations\nAn osteosarcoma patient in a phase II study who had high creatinine level at enrolment showed an\nincrease in blood urea and blood creatinine which was associated with mifamurtide use.\n\nImmune system disorders\nIn a phase I study, there was one report of severe allergic reaction occurring after the first infusion \nof mifamurtide at 6 mg/m2 dose level. The patient experienced shaking, chills, fever, nausea, \nvomiting, uncontrollable coughing, shortness of breath, cyanotic lips, dizziness, weakness, \nhypotension, tachycardia, hypertension and hypothermia leading to study discontinuation. There \nwas also one report of a grade 4 allergic reaction (hypertension) requiring hospitalization in the \nphase III study (see section 4.4). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe maximum tolerated dose in phase I studies was 4-6 mg/m2 with a high variability of adverse \nreactions. Signs and symptoms that were associated with higher doses and/or were dose limiting \nwere not life-threatening, and included fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache and hypo-\nor hypertension.\n\nA healthy adult volunteer accidentally received a single dose of 6.96 mg mifamurtide and experienced \na reversible treatment-related event of orthostatic hypotension.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment be initiated. \nSupportive measures should be based on institutional guidelines and the clinical symptoms \nobserved. Examples include paracetamol for fever, chills and headache and anti-emetics (other \nthan steroids) for nausea and vomiting.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Other immunostimulants, ATC code: L03AX15\n\n\n\n9\n\nMechanism of action\n\nMifamurtide (muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine, MTP-PE) is a fully synthetic \nderivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the smallest naturally-occurring immune stimulatory \ncomponent of cell walls from Mycobacterium sp. It has similar immunostimulatory effects as \nnatural MDP. MEPACT is a liposomal formulation specifically designed for in vivo targeting to \nmacrophages by intravenous infusion. \n\nMTP-PE is a specific ligand of NOD2, a receptor found primarily on monocytes, dendritic cells \nand macrophages. MTP-PE is a potent activator of monocytes and macrophages. Activation of \nhuman macrophages by mifamurtide is associated with production of cytokines, including tumour \nnecrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 and adhesion molecules, \nincluding lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion \nmolecule-1 (ICAM-1). In vitro-treated human monocytes killed allogeneic and autologous tumour \ncells (including melanoma, ovarian, colon, and renal carcinoma), but had no toxicity towards \nnormal cells. \n\nIn vivo administration of mifamurtide resulted in the inhibition of tumour growth in mouse and rat \nmodels of lung metastasis, skin and liver cancer, and fibrosarcoma. Significant enhancement of \ndisease-free survival was also demonstrated in the treatment of dog osteosarcoma and \nhemangiosarcoma with mifamurtide as adjuvant therapy. The exact mechanism by which \nmifamurtide activation of monocytes and macrophages leads to anti-tumour activity in animals \nand humans is not yet known.\n\nClinical safety and efficacy\n\nThe safety of liposomal mifamurtide has been assessed in more than 700 patients with various \nkinds and stages of cancer and in 21 healthy adult subjects (see section 4.8). \n\nIn a randomised phase III study of 678 patients (age range from 1.4 to 30.6 years) with \nnewly-diagnosed resectable high-grade osteosarcoma, the addition of adjuvant mifamurtide to \nchemotherapy (either doxorubicin cisplatin and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide),\nsignificantly increased the 6-year overall survival and resulted in a relative reduction in the risk of \ndeath by 28% (p = 0.0313, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53, 0. 97]). \n\nPaediatric population\n\nBased on the prevalence of the disease, children and young adults were studied in the pivotal trial. \nHowever, no specific subset analyses for efficacy are available in patients < 18 years of age and \n≥ 18 years of age.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of mifamurtide have been characterised in healthy adult subjects following \na 4 mg intravenous infusion and in paediatric and adult patients with osteosarcoma following a \n2 mg/m2 intravenous infusion.\n\nIn 21 healthy adult subjects mifamurtide was cleared rapidly from serum (minutes) with a half-life \nof 2.05 ± 0.40 hours, resulting in a very low serum concentration of total (liposomal and free) \nmifamurtide. The mean area under the curve (AUC) was 17.0 ± 4.86 h x nM and Cmax (maximum \nconcentration) was 15.7 ± 3.72 nM. \n\nIn 28 osteosarcoma patients aged 6 to 39 years serum total (liposomal and free) mifamurtide \nconcentrations declined rapidly with a mean half-life of 2.04 ± 0.456 hours. BSA-normalised \nclearance and half-life were similar across the age range and consistent with that determined in \nhealthy adult subjects, supporting the recommended dose of 2 mg/m2.\n\n\n\n10\n\nIn a separate study in 14 patients, mean serum concentration-time curves of total and free \nmifamurtide that were assessed after the first infusion of mifamurtide and after a last infusion \n11 or 12 weeks later, were almost superimposable and the mean AUC values of the free \nmifamurtide after the first and last infusion were similar. These data indicate that neither total nor \nfree mifamurtide accumulated during the treatment period.\n\nAt 6 hours after injection of radiolabelled liposomes containing 1 mg mifamurtide, radioactivity \nwas found in liver, spleen, nasopharynx, thyroid, and, to a lesser extent, in lung. The liposomes \nwere phagocytosed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system. In 2 of 4 patients with lung \nmetastases, radioactivity was associated with lung metastases. \n\nMetabolism of liposomal MTP-PE has not been studied in humans.\n\nAfter injection of radiolabelled liposomes containing mifamurtide, mean half-life of radiolabelled \nmaterial was biphasic with an α-phase of about 15 minutes and a terminal half-life of approximately \n18 hours.\n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of mifamurtide following a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion were evaluated in adult volunteers with mild (n = 9) or moderate (n = 8) renal impairment \nand in age-, sex-, and weight-matched healthy adults with normal renal function (n = 16). There \nwas no effect of mild (50 mL/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≤ 80 mL/min) or moderate \n(30 mL/min ≤ CLcr < 50 mL/min) renal insufficiency on the clearance of total MTP-PE, when \ncompared with that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function (CLcr \n> 80 mL/min). Additionally, the systemic exposures AUC from zero to infinity (AUCinf of free \n(non-liposome associated) MTP-PE in mild or moderate renal insufficiency were similar to those \nobserved in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of mifamurtide following a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion were evaluated in adult volunteers with mild (Child-Pugh class A; n = 9) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh class B; n = 8) hepatic impairment and in age, sex-, and weight-matched healthy \nadults with normal hepatic function (n = 19). There was no effect of mild hepatic impairment on \nthe systemic exposure (AUCinf) of total MTP-PE. Moderate hepatic impairment resulted in a small \nincrease in AUCinf of total MTP-PE, with the geometric least square mean ratio (expressed as %) \nfor moderate hepatic impairment in reference to the matched normal hepatic function group being \n119% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 94.1%-151%). Pharmacokinetic variability was higher in the \nmoderate hepatic impairment group (co-efficient of variation in systemic exposure [AUCinf] was \n50% versus < 30% in the other hepatic function groups). \n\nMean half-lives of total and free MTP-PE in mild hepatic impairment were 2.02 hours and 1.99 hours, \nrespectively, and were comparable to those in subjects with normal hepatic function (2.15 hours and \n2.26 hours, respectively). Mean half-lives of total and free MTP-PE in moderate hepatic impairment \nwere 3.21 hours and 3.15 hours, respectively. Additionally, the geometric mean plasma AUCinf of free \n(non-liposome associated) MTP-PE in mild and moderate hepatic impairment were 47% higher than \nthe corresponding values in the matched normal hepatic function groups. These changes were not \nconsidered to be clinically meaningful as the maximum tolerated dose (4-6 mg/m2) of mifamurtide is \n2-3 times the recommended dose (2 mg/m2).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn sensitive species (rabbit and dog) the highest daily dose of liposomal mifamurtide that did not \ncause adverse effects was 0.1 mg/kg, corresponding to 1.2 and 2 mg/m2, respectively. The \nno-adverse-effect level for mifamurtide in animals corresponds roughly to the 2 mg/m2 \n\nrecommend dose for humans.\n\n\n\n11\n\nData from a six-month dog study of daily intravenous injections of up to 0.5 mg/kg (10 mg/m2) \nmifamurtide provide an 8- to 19-fold cumulative exposure safety margin for overt toxicity for the \nintended clinical dose in humans. Major toxic effects associated with these high daily and \ncumulative doses of mifamurtide were mainly exaggerated pharmacological effects: pyrexia, signs \nof pronounced inflammatory response manifested as synovitis, bronchopneumonia, pericarditis \nand inflammatory necrosis of the liver and bone marrow. The following events were also \nobserved: haemorrhage and prolongation of coagulation times, infarcts, morphological changes in \nthe wall of small arteries, oedema and congestion of the central nervous system, minor cardiac \neffects, and slight hyponatraemia. Mifamurtide was not mutagenic and did not cause teratogenic \neffects in rats and rabbits. Embryotoxic effects were observed only at maternal toxic levels.\n\nThere were no results from general toxicity studies that suggested harmful effects on male or \nfemale reproductive organs. Specific studies addressing reproductive function, perinatal toxicity \nand carcinogenic potential have not been performed. \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n25\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nMEPACT 4 mg powder for concentrate for dispersion for infusion\nmifamurtide\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What MEPACT is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use MEPACT\n3. How to use MEPACT\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store MEPACT\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What MEPACT is and what it is used for\n\nMEPACT contains the active substance mifamurtide, similar to a component of the cell wall of \ncertain bacteria. It stimulates your immune system to help your body kill tumour cells.\n\nMEPACT is used to treat osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in children, adolescents and young adults\n(between 2 and 30 years). It is used after you have had surgery to remove the tumour and together \nwith chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer coming back.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use MEPACT\n\nDo not use MEPACT:\n- if you are allergic to mifamurtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you are taking medicines containing ciclosporin or other calcineurin inhibitors or high \n\ndoses of non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (see “Using other medicines” \nbelow).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before using MEPACT:\n- if you have or have had problems with your heart or blood vessels, like blood clots \n\n(thrombosis), bleeding (haemorrhage) or inflammation of the veins (vasculitis). You \nshould be more closely monitored while receiving MEPACT treatment. If you have \nlong-lasting or worsening symptoms, you should contact your doctor, as MEPACT \ntreatment may need to be delayed or discontinued.\n\n- if you have a history of asthma or other breathing disorders. Before using MEPACT, you \nshould discuss with your doctor whether you should take medicine for your asthma when \nusing MEPACT.\n\n- if you have a history of inflammatory or autoimmune disease or have been treated with \ncorticosteroids or other medicines that may affect your immune system.\n\n- if you have any allergic reactions to any medicines such as rash, breathlessness and high \nblood pressure. If you have worsening symptoms, you should contact your doctor, as these \nmay have been caused by MEPACT. \n\n\n\n26\n\n- if you have stomach problems such as nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite. If your \nproblems increase, you should contact your doctor, as these may have been caused by \nMEPACT when used with chemotherapy. \n\n- if you develop chills or shivering, or feel warm. You should take your temperature as you \nmay have a fever. A fever with a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) may be a sign \nof serious infection. \n\nDetailed information on warnings and precautions relating to side effects that could occur while you \nare taking the medicine is presented in section 4.\n\nChildren \nIt is not recommended to give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years because \ninformation on how safe and how well this medicine works is not available for this age group.\n\nOther medicines and MEPACT\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This\nincludes medicines that may be obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell \nyour doctor if you are taking medicines containing any of the following active substances:\n\n- ciclosporin, tacrolimus, used after a transplant to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, or \nother immunosuppressants used e.g. to treat psoriasis (a skin disease).\n\n- Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, or \ndiclofenac, used for treatment of headaches, fever or pain. You must not use MEPACT with\nhigh doses of NSAIDs.\n\n- corticosteroids, used to treat inflammations, allergies or asthma. Regular use of \ncorticosteroids should be avoided when using MEPACT as this may affect the way the \nmedicine works.\n\nIt is recommended to separate the times of administration of MEPACT and doxorubicin or other \nmedicines if used in the same chemotherapy treatment regimen.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\nMEPACT has not been tested in pregnant women. Therefore, MEPACT should not be used during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. \nYou should use effective contraception if you are being treated with MEPACT. \n\nIt is not known whether MEPACT passes to human milk. If you are breast-feeding, you should \ndiscuss with your doctor.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome very common and common side effects of MEPACT treatment (such as dizziness, vertigo, \nfatigue and blurred vision) may affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nMEPACT contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to use MEPACT\n\nDose and duration of treatment\nMEPACT will be administered only under the supervision of a specialist physician. \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are \nnot sure.\n\n\n\n27\n\nThe recommended dose of MEPACT is 2 mg mifamurtide/m2 body surface area. It will be given to \nyou twice a week (at least three days apart) for the first 12 weeks, then once a week for 24 more \nweeks. \n\nThe schedule of your MEPACT treatments can be adjusted to fit with your chemotherapy \nschedule. It is not necessary to interrupt your schedule of MEPACT if your chemotherapy is \ndelayed; you should complete 36 weeks (9 months) of treatment with MEPACT without an \ninterruption.\n\nHow MEPACT is given\nThe freeze-dried powder has to be reconstituted into a liquid suspension, filtered using the filter \nprovided and further diluted before use. MEPACT is then infused directly into your vein \n(intravenous) over about 1 hour. This is done by your doctor or a nurse, who will also monitor you \nduring that time. You do not need to be hospitalised to receive MEPACT. It can also be \nadministered as an outpatient.\n\nIf you use more MEPACT than you should\nYou may experience more severe side effects, including fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, \nheadache and high blood pressure or low blood pressure. In the event of such an overdose, contact \nyour doctor or nearest hospital.\n\nIf you stop using MEPACT\nYou should not stop treatment with MEPACT before finishing the course of treatment without \ndiscussing with your doctor first.

This should \ntake approximately 30 minutes. \n\n1. The cap of the vial should be removed and the stopper cleaned using an alcohol pad.\n2. The filter should be removed from the blister pack, and the cap removed from the filter \n\nspike. \nThe spike should then be inserted into the vial septum firmly until seated. The filter luer \nconnector cap should not be removed at this time.\n\n3. The 100 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection bag, needle and syringe \nshould be unpacked (not provided in the pack).\n\n4. The site of the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection bag where the needle \nis going to be inserted should be swabbed with an alcohol pad.\n\n5. Using the needle and syringe, 50 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection should be withdrawn from the bag.\n\n6. After removing the needle from the syringe, the syringe should be attached to the filter by \nopening the filter luer connector cap (figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\n\n7. The sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is added to the vial by slow, \nfirm depression of the syringe plunger. The filter and syringe must not be removed from \nthe vial.\n\n\n\n31\n\n8. The vial should be allowed to stand undisturbed for 1 minute to ensure thorough hydration \nof the dry substance.\n\n9. The vial should then be shaken vigorously for 1 minute while keeping the filter and \nsyringe attached. During this time the liposomes are formed spontaneously (figure 2).\n\nFigure 2\n\n10. The desired dose may be withdrawn from the vial by inverting the vial and slowly pulling \nback on the syringe plunger (figure 3). Each mL reconstituted suspension contains 0.08 mg \nmifamurtide. The volume of suspension to be withdrawn for dose quantities is calculated as \nfollows:\n\nVolume to withdraw = [12.5 x calculated dose (mg)] mL\n\nFor convenience, the following table of concordance is provided:\n\nDose Volume\n\n1.0 mg 12.5 mL\n\n2.0 mg 25 mL\n\n3.0 mg 37.5 mL\n\n4.0 mg 50 mL\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n32\n\n11. The syringe should then be removed from the filter and a new needle placed on the \nsuspension-filled syringe. The bag injection site should be wiped with an alcohol pad and \nthe suspension in the syringe should be injected into the original bag containing the \nremaining 50 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (figure 4).\n\nFigure 4\n\n12. The bag should be gently swirled to mix the solution.\n13. Patient identification, time and date should be added to the label on the bag containing the \n\nreconstituted, filtered and diluted liposomal suspension.\n14. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at room \n\ntemperature (between approximately 20 C-25 °C).\n15. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser and would normally not be longer than 6 hours at room temperature.\n\nNo special requirements for disposal.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
