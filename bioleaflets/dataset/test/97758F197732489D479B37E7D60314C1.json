Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nINCIVO 375 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 375 mg of telaprevir.\n\nExcipient: 2.3 mg of sodium per film-coated tablet.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\nYellow caplet shaped tablets of approximately 20 mm in length, marked with \u201cT375\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nINCIVO, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, is indicated for the treatment of \ngenotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in adult patients with compensated liver disease (including cirrhosis):\n- who are treatment-na\u00efve;\n- who have previously been treated with interferon alfa (pegylated or non-pegylated) alone or in \n\ncombination with ribavirin, including relapsers, partial responders and null responders (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with INCIVO should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of chronic hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\nINCIVO, 1,125 mg (three 375 mg film-coated tablets) should be taken orally twice daily (b.i.d.) with \nfood. Alternatively, 750 mg (two 375 mg tablets) can be taken orally every 8 hours (q8h) with food. \nThe total daily dose is 6 tablets (2,250 mg). Taking INCIVO without food or without regard to the \ndosing interval may result in decreased plasma concentrations of telaprevir which could reduce the \ntherapeutic effect of INCIVO.\n\nINCIVO should be administered in conjunction with ribavirin and either peginterferon alfa-2a or -2b. \nPlease consult sections 4.4 and 5.1 regarding the selection of peginterferon alfa-2a or -2b. For specific \ndosage instructions for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nthese medicinal products should be consulted.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nDuration of treatment \u2013 Treatment-na\u00efve adults and prior treatment relapsers\nTreatment with INCIVO must be initiated in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and \nadministered for 12 weeks (see figure 1).\n- Patients with undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) (target not detected) \n\nat weeks 4 and 12 receive an additional 12 weeks of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone for a \ntotal treatment duration of 24 weeks.\n\n- Patients with detectable HCV RNA at either weeks 4 or 12 receive an additional 36 weeks of \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone for a total treatment duration of 48 weeks.\n\n- For all patients with cirrhosis irrespective of undetectable HCV RNA (target not detected) at \nweeks 4 or 12, an additional 36 weeks of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone for a total \ntreatment duration of 48 weeks is recommended (see section 5.1).\n\nFigure 1: Duration of treatment for treatment-na\u00efve patients and prior treatment \nrelapsers\n\nHCV RNA levels should be monitored at weeks 4 and 12 to determine treatment duration. In Phase 3 \nstudies, a sensitive real-time PCR assay with a limit of quantification of 25 IU/ml and a limit of \ndetection of 10-15 IU/ml was used to determine whether HCV RNA levels were undetectable (target \nnot detected) (see section 5.1). Detectable HCV RNA below the lower limit of assay quantification \nshould not be used as a substitute for \u201cundetectable\u201d (target not detected), for making decisions on \ntreatment duration, as this may lead to an insufficient duration of therapy and higher relapse rates. See \ntable 1 for Guidelines for Discontinuation of INCIVO, Peginterferon Alfa, and Ribavirin Treatment.\n\nDuration of treatment \u2013 Previously treated adults with prior partial or prior null response\nTreatment with INCIVO must be initiated in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and \nadministered for 12 weeks, followed by peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy alone (without \nINCIVO) for a total treatment duration of 48 weeks (see figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Duration of treatment for previously treated patients with prior partial or prior \nnull response\n\nHCV RNA levels should be monitored at weeks 4 and 12. See table 1 for Guidelines for \nDiscontinuation of INCIVO, Peginterferon Alfa, and Ribavirin Treatment.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nAll patients\nSince it is highly unlikely that patients with inadequate viral responses will achieve a sustained \nvirologic response (SVR), it is recommended that patients with HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/ml at week 4 or\nweek 12 discontinue therapy (refer to table 1).\n\nTable 1: Guidelines for discontinuation of INCIVO, Peginterferon Alfa, and Ribavirin \ntreatment\nMedicinal products HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/ml at \n\nweek 4 of treatmenta\nHCV RNA > 1,000 IU/ml at \n\nweek 12 of treatmenta\n\nINCIVO Permanently discontinue INCIVO treatment completed\nPeginterferon alfa and \nRibavirin\n\nPermanently discontinue\n\na\ntreatment with INCIVO, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin. These guidelines may not perform similarly when a lead-in \ntreatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin has been used prior to starting INCIVO therapy (see section 5.1).\n\nIn the Phase 3 studies, none of the patients with HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/ml at either week 4 or week 12 \nachieved SVR with continued peginterferon alfa and ribavirin treatment. In treatment-na\u00efve patients in \nthe Phase 3 studies, 4/16 (25%) patients with HCV RNA levels between 100 IU/ml and 1,000 IU/ml at\nweek 4 achieved SVR. In patients with HCV RNA between 100 IU/ml and 1,000 IU/ml at week 12, \n2/8 (25%) achieved an SVR.\n\nIn prior null responders, consideration should be given to conduct an additional HCV RNA test \nbetween weeks 4 and 12. If the HCV RNA concentration is > 1,000 IU/ml, INCIVO, peginterferon \nalfa, and ribavirin should be discontinued.\n\nFor patients receiving a total of 48 weeks of treatment, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin should be \ndiscontinued if HCV RNA is detectable at week 24 or week 36.\n\nINCIVO must be taken with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin to prevent treatment failure.\n\nTo prevent treatment failure, the dose of INCIVO must not be reduced or interrupted.\n\nIf INCIVO treatment is discontinued due to adverse drug reactions or because of insufficient virologic\nresponse, INCIVO treatment should not be reinitiated.\n\nRefer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for \nguidelines on dose modifications, interruptions, discontinuations or resumption of those medicinal \nproducts (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen administered twice daily (b.i.d.), in case a dose of INCIVO is missed within 6 hours of the time \nit is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of INCIVO with food as \nsoon as possible. If the missed dose is noticed more than 6 hours after the time INCIVO should be\ntaken, the missed dose should be skipped and the patient should resume the normal dosing schedule.\n\nWhen administered every 8 hours (q8h), in case a dose of INCIVO is missed within 4 hours of the \ntime it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of INCIVO with food \nas soon as possible. If the missed dose is noticed more than 4 hours after the time INCIVO should be\ntaken, the missed dose should be skipped and the patient should resume the normal dosing schedule.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nThere are no clinical data on the use of INCIVO in HCV patients with moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl \u2264 50 ml/min) (see section 4.4). In HCV-negative patients with severe renal \nimpairment, no clinically relevant change in telaprevir exposure was observed (see section 5.2).\nTherefore, no dose adjustment is recommended for INCIVO in HCV patients with renal impairment.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nThere are no clinical data on the use of INCIVO in patients on haemodialysis.\n\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for patients with CrCl < 50 ml/min.\n\nHepatic impairment\nINCIVO is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B \nor C, score \u2265 7) or decompensated liver disease (ascites, portal hypertensive bleeding, \nencephalopathy, and/or jaundice other than Gilbert\u2019s Syndrome, see section 4.4). Dose modification \nof INCIVO is not required when administered to hepatitis C patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A, score 5-6).\n\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin which are \ncontraindicated in Child-Pugh score \u2265 6.\n\nHCV/Human immunodeficiency virus type (HIV)-1 co-infection\nHCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients should be treated in the same way as HCV mono-infected patients.\nDrug interactions need to be carefully taken into account, see sections 4.4 and 4.5. Patients on an \nefavirenz-based regimen must receive INCIVO 1,125 mg every 8 hours. For outcomes obtained in \nHIV co-infected patients, see section 5.1.\n\nLiver transplant patients without cirrhosis\nTreatment with INCIVO must be initiated in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and \nadministered for 12 weeks with an additional 36 weeks of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone for a \ntotal treatment duration of 48 weeks. No dose adjustment of INCIVO is required in stable liver \ntransplant patients (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). A lower ribavirin dose (600 mg/day) at initiation of \nINCIVO treatment is recommended (see section 5.1). At the initiation and discontinuation of INCIVO \ntreatment, doses of co-administered tacrolimus or cyclosporine A need to be markedly adjusted (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5, Immunosuppressants).\n\nElderly\nThere are limited clinical data on the use of INCIVO in HCV patients aged \u2265 65 years.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of INCIVO in children aged < 18 years have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole (e.g. patients should not chew, break or \ndissolve the tablet).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nConcomitant administration with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance \nand for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening \nevents. These active substances include alfuzosin, amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, astemizole,\nterfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, \nmethylergonovine), lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, sildenafil or tadalafil (only when used for \ntreatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension), quetiapine and orally administered midazolam or\ntriazolam (see section 4.5).\n\nConcomitant administration with Class Ia or III antiarrhythmics, except for intravenous lidocaine (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nConcomitant administration of INCIVO with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A e.g. \nrifampicin, St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital and \nthus may lead to lower exposure and loss of efficacy of INCIVO.\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for a list of their \ncontraindications since INCIVO must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nSevere rash\nSevere, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported with INCIVO \ncombination treatment. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) including fatal outcome has been observed \nin post-marketing experience (see section 4.8). Fatal cases have been reported in patients with \nprogressive rash and systemic symptoms who continued to receive INCIVO combination treatment \nafter a serious skin reaction was identified.\n\nIn placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 trials, severe rash (primarily eczematous, pruritic and involving \nmore than 50% body surface area) was reported in 4.8% of patients who received INCIVO \ncombination treatment compared to 0.4% receiving peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Available data \nsuggest that peginterferon alfa, and perhaps also ribavirin, may contribute to the frequency and \nseverity of rash associated with INCIVO combination treatment.\n\n5.8% of patients discontinued INCIVO alone due to rash events and 2.6% of patients discontinued \nINCIVO combination treatment for rash events compared to none of those receiving peginterferon \nalfa and ribavirin.\n\nIn placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 trials, 0.4% of patients had suspected Drug Rash with \nEosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). In INCIVO clinical experience, less than 0.1% of \npatients had Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). All of these reactions resolved with treatment \ndiscontinuation.\n\nDRESS presents as a rash with eosinophilia associated with one or more of the following features: \nfever, lymphadenopathy, facial oedema, and internal organ involvement (hepatic, renal, pulmonary). It \nmay appear at any time after start of treatment, although the majority of cases appeared between six \nand ten weeks after the start of treatment with INCIVO.\n\nPrescribers should ensure that patients are fully informed about the risk of severe rashes, and to \nconsult with their prescriber immediately if they develop a new rash or worsening of an existing rash.\nAll rashes should be monitored for progression and until the rash is resolved. The rash may take \nseveral weeks to resolve. Other medicinal products associated with severe cutaneous reactions should \nbe used with caution during administration of INCIVO combination treatment to avoid potential \nconfusion as to which medicinal product could be contributing to a severe cutaneous reaction. In the \ncase of a serious skin reaction, discontinuation of other medicinal products known to be associated \nwith serious skin reactions should be considered.\n\nFor additional information on mild to moderate rash, see section 4.8.\n\nThe recommendations for monitoring of cutaneous reactions, and for discontinuation of INCIVO, \nribavirin and peginterferon alfa are summarised in the table below:\n\nExtent and features of Cutaneous \nReactions\n\nRecommendations for Monitoring of Cutaneous \nReactions and Discontinuation of INCIVO, \nRibavirin and Peginterferon alfa for Severe Rash\n\nMild rash: localised skin eruption and/or a \nskin eruption with a limited distribution (up \nto several isolated sites on the body)\n\nMonitor for progression or systemic symptoms until \nthe rash is resolved.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nModerate rash: Diffuse rash \u2264 50% of body \nsurface area\n\nMonitor for progression or systemic symptoms until \nthe rash is resolved. Consider consultation with a \nspecialist in dermatology.\n\nFor moderate rash that progresses, permanent \ndiscontinuation of INCIVO should be considered. If \nthe rash does not improve\nwithin 7 days following INCIVO discontinuation, \nribavirin should be interrupted. Interruption of \nribavirin may be required sooner if the rash worsens \ndespite discontinuation of telaprevir. Peginterferon \nalfa may be continued unless interruption is \nmedically indicated.\n\nFor moderate rash that progresses to severe (\u2265 50% \nbody surface area), permanently discontinue \nINCIVO (see below).\n\nSevere rash: Extent of rash > 50% of body \nsurface area or associated with vesicles, \nbullae, ulcerations other than SJS\n\nPermanently discontinue INCIVO immediately.\nConsultation with a specialist in dermatology is \nrecommended.\nMonitor for progression or systemic symptoms until \nthe rash is resolved.\n\nPeginterferon alfa and ribavirin may be continued. If \nimprovement is not observed within 7 days of \nINCIVO discontinuation, sequential or simultaneous \ninterruption or discontinuation of ribavirin and/or \npeginterferon alfa should be considered. If medically\nindicated, earlier interruption or discontinuation of \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin may be needed.\n\nSerious skin reactions including rash with \nsystemic symptoms, progressive severe rash, \nsuspicion or diagnosis of generalised \nbullous eruption, DRESS, SJS/TEN, acute \ngeneralized exanthematous pustulosis, \nerythema multiforme\n\nPermanent and immediate discontinuation of \nINCIVO, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin. Consult \nwith a specialist in dermatology.\n\nIf discontinued due to a skin reaction, INCIVO must not be restarted. Refer also to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for severe skin reactions associated with \nthese products.\n\nAnaemia\nIn placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the overall incidence and severity of anaemia \nincreased with INCIVO combination treatment compared to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. \nHaemoglobin values of < 10 g/dl were observed in 34% of patients who received INCIVO \ncombination treatment and in 14% of patients who received peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. \nHaemoglobin values of < 8.5 g/dl were observed in 8% of INCIVO combination treatment compared \nto 2% of patients receiving peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. A decrease in haemoglobin levels occurs \nduring the first 4 weeks of treatment, with lowest values reached at the end of INCIVO dosing. \nHaemoglobin values gradually improve after completion of INCIVO dosing.\n\nHaemoglobin should be monitored at regular intervals prior to and during INCIVO combination \ntreatment (see section 4.4, Laboratory tests).\n\nRibavirin dose reduction is the preferred strategy for managing treatment-emergent anaemia. Refer to \nthe Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for information regarding dose reduction and/or \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\ndiscontinuation of ribavirin. If ribavirin is permanently discontinued for the management of anaemia, \nINCIVO must also be permanently discontinued. If INCIVO is discontinued for anaemia, patients may \ncontinue treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Ribavirin may be restarted per the dosing \nmodification guidelines for ribavirin. The dose of INCIVO must not be reduced, and INCIVO must \nnot be restarted if discontinued.\n\nPregnancy and contraception requirements\nBecause INCIVO must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the\ncontraindications and warnings applicable to those medicinal products are applicable to combination \ntherapy.\n\nSignificant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species \nexposed to ribavirin, therefore, extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and \nin female partners of male patients.\n\nFemale patients of childbearing potential and their male partners as well as male patients and their \nfemale partners must use 2 effective contraceptive methods during INCIVO treatment and afterwards\nas recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin, and as described below.\n\nHormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during INCIVO dosing and for up \nto two months following cessation of INCIVO (see section 4.5). During this time, female patients of \nchildbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Two months \nafter completion of INCIVO treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the \ntwo required effective methods of birth control.\n\nFor additional information, see sections 4.5 and 4.6.\n\nCardiovascular\nResults of a study conducted in healthy volunteers demonstrated a modest effect of telaprevir at a \ndose of 1,875 mg every 8 hours on the QTcF interval with a placebo-adjusted maximum mean \nincrease of 8.0 msec (90% CI: 5.1-10.9) (see section 5.1). Exposure at this dose was comparable to \nthe exposure in HCV-infected patients receiving a dose of 750 mg INCIVO every 8 hours plus \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin. The potential clinical significance of these findings is uncertain.\n\nINCIVO should be used with caution with Class Ic antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide, \nincluding appropriate clinical and ECG monitoring.\n\nCaution is recommended when prescribing INCIVO concurrently with medicinal products known to \ninduce QT prolongation and which are CYP3A substrates such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, \ntelithromycin, posaconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, tacrolimus, salmeterol (see section 4.5).\nINCIVO co-administration with domperidone should be avoided (see section 4.5). INCIVO may \nincrease concentrations of the co-administered medicinal product and this may result in an increased \nrisk of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. In the event that co-administration of such medicinal\nproducts with INCIVO is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is \nrecommended. See also section 4.3 for medicinal products which are contraindicated with INCIVO.\n\nUse of INCIVO should be avoided in patients with congenital QT prolongation, or a family history of \ncongenital QT prolongation or sudden death. In the event that treatment with INCIVO in such patients\nis judged strictly necessary, patients should be closely monitored, including ECG assessments.\n\nUse INCIVO with caution in patients with:\n- a history of acquired QT prolongation;\n- clinically relevant bradycardia (persistent heart rate < 50 bpm);\n- a history of heart failure with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction;\n- a requirement for medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval but the metabolism of \n\nwhich is not mainly CYP3A4 dependent (e.g. methadone, see section 4.5).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\nSuch patients should be closely monitored, including ECG assessments.\n\nElectrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia) should be \nmonitored and corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during INCIVO therapy.\n\nUse in patients with advanced liver disease\nHypoalbuminaemia and low platelet counts have been identified as predictors of severe complications \nof liver disease as well as of interferon-based therapies (e.g., hepatic decompensation, serious \nbacterial infections). Furthermore, high rates of anaemia have been seen when using INCIVO with \npeginterferon and ribavirin in patients with these characteristics. INCIVO in combination with \npeginterferon and ribavirin is not recommended in patients with platelets < 90,000/mm3 and/or \nalbumin < 3.3 g/dl. When INCIVO is used in patients with advanced liver disease very close \nmonitoring and early management of adverse events is recommended.\n\nLaboratory tests\nHCV RNA levels should be monitored at weeks 4 and 12 and as clinically indicated (see also \nguidelines for discontinuation of INCIVO, section 4.2).\n\nThe following laboratory evaluations (complete blood count with white blood cell differential counts, \nelectrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, TSH, uric acid) must be conducted in all patients \nprior to initiating INCIVO combination treatment.\n\nThese are recommended baseline values for initiation of INCIVO combination treatment:\n- Haemoglobin: \u2265 12 g/dl (females); \u2265 13 g/dl (males)\n- Platelet count \u2265 90,000/mm3\n\n- Absolute neutrophil counts \u2265 1,500/mm3\n\n- Adequately controlled thyroid function (TSH)\n- Calculated creatinine clearance \u2265 50 ml/min\n- Potassium \u2265 3.5 mmol/l\n- Albumin > 3.3 g/dl\n\nHaematology evaluations (including white cell differential count) are recommended at weeks 2, 4, 8 \nand 12 and as clinically appropriate.\n\nChemistry evaluations (electrolytes, serum creatinine, uric acid, hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, TSH) are \nrecommended as frequently as the haematology evaluations or as clinically indicated (see section 4.8).\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, including \npregnancy testing requirements (see section 4.6).\n\nThe use of INCIVO in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nThe Phase 3 studies were all conducted with peginterferon alfa-2a in combination with INCIVO and \nribavirin. There is no data using INCIVO in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b in \ntreatment-experienced patients and limited data in treatment-na\u00efve patients. Na\u00efve patients treated \nwith either peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin (n = 80) or peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin (n = 81) in \ncombination with INCIVO, in an open label study, had comparable SVR rates. However, patients \ntreated with peginterferon alfa-2b experienced more frequent viral breakthrough, and were less likely \nto meet the criteria for shortened total treatment duration (see section 5.1).\n\nGeneral\nINCIVO must not be administered as monotherapy and must only be prescribed in combination with \nboth peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. The Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa \nand ribavirin must therefore be consulted before starting therapy with INCIVO.\n\nThere are no clinical data on re-treating patients who have failed an HCV NS3-4A protease \ninhibitor-based therapy (see section 5.1).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10\n\nInsufficient virologic response\nIn patients who have an inadequate viral response, treatment should be discontinued (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4, Laboratory tests).\n\nUse of INCIVO in treatment of other HCV genotypes\nThere are not sufficient clinical data to support the treatment of patients with HCV genotypes other \nthan genotype 1. Therefore, the use of INCIVO in patients with non-genotype-1 HCV is not \nrecommended.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe safety and efficacy have not been established in patients with moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl < 50 ml/min) or in patients on haemodialysis. Refer to section 4.4, Laboratory tests.\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for patients with CrCL < 50 ml/min \n(see also section 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nINCIVO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, score \u2265 10) \nor decompensated liver disease (ascites, portal hypertensive bleeding, encephalopathy, and/or \njaundice other than Gilbert\u2019s Syndrome) and is not recommended in these populations.\n\nINCIVO has not been studied in HCV-infected patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh B, score 7-9). In HCV negative patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reduced \nexposure to telaprevir was observed. The appropriate dose of INCIVO in hepatitis C-infected patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment has not been determined. Therefore, INCIVO is not recommended \nin these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin which must be \nco-administered with INCIVO.\n\nOrgan transplant patients\nINCIVO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin was evaluated in 74 HCV-1 infected, \npost-liver transplant patients without cirrhosis receiving either tacrolimus or cyclosporine A. At the \ninitiation of INCIVO treatment, doses of co-administered tacrolimus or cyclosporine A need to be \nmarkedly reduced, including a prolongation in the dosing interval for tacrolimus, in order to maintain \ntherapeutic plasma concentrations of the immunosuppressant. Upon completion of INCIVO, doses of \ntacrolimus or cyclosporine A need to be increased, and the dosing interval for tacrolimus will need to \nbe reduced. Some patients may require higher doses of tacrolimus or cyclosporine A than at the \ninitiation of treatment. These changes should be based on frequent monitoring of tacrolimus or \ncyclosporine A plasma concentrations during INCIVO treatment. For information on the use of \nINCIVO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in treatment-na\u00efve and \ntreatment-experienced HCV-1 infected patients who were liver transplant recipients and were on a \nstable regimen of the immunosuppressants tacrolimus or cyclosporine A, see sections 4.2, \n4.5, Immunosuppressants, 4.8, and 5.1.\n\nNo clinical data are available regarding the treatment of pre- or peri-liver or other transplant patients \nwith INCIVO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nHCV/HIV co-infection\nInteractions between telaprevir and HIV antiretroviral agents are frequent, and the recommendations \nin table 2, section 4.5, should be carefully followed.\n\nAmong HIV regimens that can be used (not limited to those below) the following should be taken into \naccount:\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\nAtazanavir/ritonavir: this combination is associated with a high frequency of \nhyperbilirubinaemia/icterus. In Study HPC3008 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1), transient grade 3 \n(2.5 to \u22645 X ULN) and grade 4 (>5 X ULN) bilirubin increases during INCIVO treatment were seen \nin 39% and in 22% of the 59 patients on atazanavir/ritonavir, respectively.\n\nEfavirenz: with this combination the telaprevir dose must be increased to 1,125 mg three times per \nday (q8h).\n\nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection\nThere are no data on the use of INCIVO in patients with HCV/HBV co-infection.\n\nPaediatric population\nINCIVO is not recommended for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age \nbecause the safety and efficacy has not been established in this population.\n\nThyroid disease\nIncrease in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) may occur during INCIVO combination treatment, \nwhich may indicate worsening or recurrence of pre-existing or previous hypothyroidism, or new-onset \nhypothyroidism (see section 4.8). TSH levels should be determined before and during the course of \nINCIVO combination treatment and treated as clinically appropriate, including potential adjustment \nof thyroid replacement therapy in patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism (see section 4.4, \nLaboratory tests).\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\nTelaprevir is a strong inhibitor of the important drug metabolising enzyme CYP3A4. Increased \nsystemic exposures are expected if telaprevir is combined with drugs highly metabolised by this \nenzyme. Refer to section 4.3 for a listing of medicinal products that are contraindicated for use with \nINCIVO due to potentially life-threatening adverse events or potential loss of therapeutic effect to \nINCIVO. Refer to section 4.5 for established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of INCIVO\nThis medicinal product contains 2.3 mg sodium per tablet, which should be taken into consideration \nby patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTelaprevir is partly metabolised in the liver by CYP3A and is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate. Other \nenzymes are also involved in the metabolism (see section 5.2). Co-administration of INCIVO and \nmedicinal products that induce CYP3A and/or P-gp may markedly decrease telaprevir plasma \nconcentrations. Co-administration of INCIVO and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A and/or P-gp \nmay increase telaprevir plasma concentrations.\n\nINCIVO is a strong, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and also markedly inhibits P-gp. The time \ndependency indicates that inhibition of CYP3A4 may be intensified during the first 2 weeks of \ntreatment. After ending treatment, approximately one week may be needed for the inhibition to \ncompletely disappear. Administration of INCIVO may increase systemic exposure to medicinal \nproducts that are substrates of CYP3A or P-gp, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic \neffect and adverse reactions. Based on the results of drug-drug interaction clinical studies (e.g., \nescitalopram, zolpidem, ethinylestradiol), induction of metabolic enzymes by telaprevir cannot be \nexcluded.\n\nTelaprevir inhibits organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATPs) OATP1B1 and OATP2B1. \nConcomitant administration of INCIVO and drugs transported by these transporters such as \nfluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, bosentan and repaglinide should be undertaken with \ncaution (see table 2). Simvastatin is contraindicated due to the predicted marked increase in exposure \ncaused by multiple mechanisms.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12\n\nBased on in vitro studies, telaprevir may potentially increase plasma concentrations of medicinal \nproducts in which excretion is dependent upon multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-1 and \nMATE2-K (see table 2).\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nContraindications of concomitant use (see section 4.3)\nINCIVO must not be administered concurrently with active substances that are highly dependent on \nCYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or \nlife-threatening events such as cardiac arrhythmia (i.e., amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, \npimozide, quinidine, terfenadine), or peripheral vasospasm or ischemia (i.e., dihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), or myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (i.e., lovastatin, \nsimvastatin, atorvastatin), or prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression (i.e., \nquetiapine, orally administered midazolam or triazolam), or hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia (i.e., \nalfuzosin and sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension).\n\nINCIVO must not be administered concurrently with Class Ia or III antiarrhythmics, except for \nintravenous lidocaine.\n\nINCIVO should be used with caution with Class Ic antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide,\nincluding appropriate clinical and ECG monitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nRifampicin\nRifampicin reduces the telaprevir plasma AUC by approximately 92%. Therefore, INCIVO must not \nbe co-administered with rifampicin.\n\nSt John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\nPlasma concentrations of telaprevir can be reduced by concomitant use of the herbal preparation \nSt John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). Therefore, herbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort \nmust not be combined with INCIVO.\n\nCarbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital\nCo-administration with inducers may lead to lower exposure of telaprevir with risk of lower efficacy. \nPotent CYP3A inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital, are contraindicated \n(see section 4.3).\n\nMild and moderate CYP3A inducers\nMild and moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided, particularly in patients who are prior \nnon-responders (partial or null responders for peginterferon alfa/ribavirin), unless specific dose \nrecommendations are given (refer to table 2).\n\nOther combinations\nTable 2 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with INCIVO. These \nrecommendations are based on either drug interaction studies (indicated with *) or predicted \ninteractions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse reactions or \nloss of efficacy. Most drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with a telaprevir dose of \n750 mg every 8 hours (q8h). Given that the 1,125 mg b.i.d. regimen results in the same daily dose \nwith similar drug exposures of telaprevir, the relative drug interactions are expected to be similar.\n\nThe direction of the arrow (\u2191 = increase, \u2193 = decrease, \u2194 = no change) for each pharmacokinetic \nparameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (\u2194), \nbelow (\u2193) or above (\u2191) the 80-125% range.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nTable 2: INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL \nPRODUCTS\n\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nEffect on concentration of \nINCIVO or concomitant \nmedicinal product and \npossible mechanism\n\nClinical comment\n\nANALGESICS\nalfentanil\nfentanyl\n\n\u2191 alfentanil\n\u2191 fentanyl\n\nCareful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse \neffects (including respiratory depression) is \nrecommended when telaprevir is \nco-administered with alfentanil or fentanyl, \nincluding oral, buccal, nasal and \nextended-release transdermal or transmucosal \npreparations of fentanyl, especially at initiation \nof treatment.

Animal studies are insufficient with \nrespect to human reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). INCIVO is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.\n\nContraception in males and females\nBecause INCIVO must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the \ncontraindications and warnings applicable to those medicinal products are applicable to combination \ntherapy.\n\nDue to the combined treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, female patients of childbearing \npotential and their male partners as well as male patients and their female partners must use \n2 effective contraceptive methods during INCIVO treatment. Following completion of INCIVO \ntherapy contraceptive recommendations should be followed as in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin, and as described below.\n\nHormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during INCIVO dosing and for up \nto two months following cessation of INCIVO (see section 4.5). During this time, female patients of \nchildbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Two months \nafter completion of INCIVO treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the \ntwo required effective methods of birth control.\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin and peginterferon alpha for additional \ninformation.\n\nBreast-feeding\nTelaprevir and its major metabolite are excreted in rat milk (see section 5.3). It is not known whether \ntelaprevir is excreted in human breast milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed\ninfants, due to the combined treatment of INCIVO with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, \nbreast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of therapy.

No studies on the \neffects of INCIVO on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Syncope and \nretinopathy have been reported in some patients taking INCIVO and should be considered when \nassessing a patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machines. Refer also to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for further information.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe overall safety profile of INCIVO is based on Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial data (both controlled and \nuncontrolled) containing 3,441 patients who received INCIVO combination treatment and on \nspontaneous postmarketing reports.\n\nINCIVO must be administered with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Refer to their respective \nSummary of Product Characteristics for their associated adverse reactions.\n\nThe incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of at least moderate intensity (\u2265 Grade 2) was higher \nin the INCIVO group than in the placebo group.\n\nDuring the INCIVO/placebo treatment phase, the most frequently reported ADRs of at least Grade 2 \nin severity in the INCIVO group (incidence \u2265 5.0%) were anaemia, rash, pruritus, nausea, and \ndiarrhoea.\nDuring the INCIVO/placebo treatment phase, the most frequently reported ADRs of at least Grade 3 \nin the INCIVO group (incidence \u2265 1.0%) were anaemia, rash, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, \npruritus, and nausea.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nADRs to INCIVO are presented in table 3.\n\nADRs are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).

After the end of INCIVO treatment, uric acid values typically \ndecrease over the following 8 weeks and are comparable to those observed in patients receiving \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nRash\nSevere, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported with INCIVO \ncombination treatment, including DRESS, SJS, and TEN (see section 4.4). In placebo-controlled \nPhase 2 and 3 trials, the overall incidence and severity of rash increased when INCIVO was \nco-administered with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. During INCIVO treatment, rash events (all \ngrades) were reported in 55% of patients who received INCIVO combination treatment and in 33% of \npatients who received peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nMore than 90% of rashes were of mild or moderate severity. The rash reported during INCIVO \ncombination treatment was assessed as a typically pruritic, eczematous rash, and involved less than \n30% of body surface area. Half the rashes started during the first 4 weeks, but rash can occur at any \ntime during INCIVO combination treatment. Discontinuation of INCIVO combination treatment is not \nrequired for mild and moderate rash.\n\nSee section 4.4 for recommendations for monitoring of rash and discontinuation of INCIVO, ribavirin, \nand peginterferon alfa. Patients experiencing mild to moderate rash should be monitored for signs of \nprogression; however, progression was infrequent (less than 10%). In clinical trials, the majority of \npatients were administered antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. Improvement of rash occurs \nafter INCIVO dosing completion or discontinuation; however, rashes may take several weeks to \nresolve.\n\nAnaemia\nIn placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 trials, anaemia (all grades) was reported in 32.1% of patients who \nreceived INCIVO combination treatment and in 14.8% of patients who received peginterferon alfa \nand ribavirin. Ribavirin dose reductions were used for management of anaemia. 21.6% of patients \nreceiving INCIVO combination treatment required ribavirin dose reduction for anaemia compared to \n9.4% of patients receiving peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. Erythropoisis-stimulating agents \n(ESAs) were generally not permitted and used in only 1% of patients in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical \ntrials. In the placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 trials, transfusions were reported during the \nINCIVO/placebo treatment phase in 2.5% of patients receiving INCIVO combination treatment and \n0.7% in patients receiving peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. Transfusion rates over the whole \nstudy period were 4.6% and 1.6%, respectively. In placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 trials, 1.9% of \npatients discontinued INCIVO alone due to anaemia, and 0.9% of patients discontinued INCIVO \ncombination treatment due to anaemia compared to 0.5% receiving peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\n(see section 4.4).\n\nAnorectal signs and symptoms\nIn clinical trials, the majority of these events (e.g., haemorrhoids, anorectal discomfort, anal pruritus, \nand rectal burning) were mild to moderate, very few led to treatment discontinuation and resolved \nafter completion of INCIVO dosing.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24\n\nPatients Co-infected with HIV-1\nThe overall safety profile of INCIVO in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients (either not on antiretroviral \ntherapy or on antiretroviral therapy) was similar to the safety profile in mono-infected HCV patients, \nexcept for patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir who frequently experienced a transient increase in \nindirect bilirubin levels (including grades 3 to 4) through week 2, returning to near baseline by \nweek 12 (see section 4.4).\n\nLiver transplant patients without cirrhosis\nThe overall safety profile of INCIVO in treatment- na\u00efve and treatment-experienced HCV-1 infected \npatients who were liver transplant recipients on a stable regimen of the immunosuppressants \ntacrolimus or cyclosporine A was generally similar to the safety profile of INCIVO in patients without \na history of liver transplantation, although anaemia was reported more frequently (55.4% versus \n32.1% in the Phase 2-3 safety pooling) during the INCIVO treatment phase. To manage anaemia, at \ninitiation of INCIVO treatment a lower starting dose of ribavirin (600 mg/day) was used; during the \noverall treatment phase the ribavirin dose was further reduced in 36.5% of patients, 41.9% received \nESAs and 21.6% received blood transfusions (see sections 4.4 and 4.5, Immunosuppressants).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of INCIVO in children aged < 18 years have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe highest documented INCIVO dose administered is 1,875 mg every 8 hours for 4 days in healthy \nvolunteers. In that study, the following common adverse events were reported more frequently with \nthe 1,875 mg every 8 hours regimen compared to the 750 mg every 8 hours regimen: nausea, \nheadache, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia and vomiting.\n\nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with INCIVO. Treatment of overdose with INCIVO\nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance may be achieved \nby emesis or gastric lavage. Gastric lavage should only be performed if this can be done within one \nhour after ingestion.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AE11.\n\nMechanism of action\nTelaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3\u20224A serine protease, which is essential for viral replication.\n\nIn vitro studies\nActivity of telaprevir against HCV\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25\n\nIn an HCV subtype 1b replicon assay, the telaprevir IC50 value against wild-type HCV was 0.354 \u00b5M \nsimilar to a subtype 1a infectious virus assay IC50 of 0.28 \u00b5M.\n\nResistance\nHCV variants associated with on-treatment virologic failure or relapse were evaluated by site-directed \nmutagenesis in the replicon assay. Variants V36A/M, T54A/S, R155K/T, and A156S conferred lower \nlevels of in vitro resistance to telaprevir (3- to 25-fold increase in telaprevir IC50), and the A156V/T \nand V36M+R155K variants conferred higher levels of in vitro resistance to telaprevir (> 25-fold \nincrease in telaprevir IC50). Replicon variants generated from patient-derived sequences showed \nsimilar results.\n\nThe in vitro replication capacity of telaprevir-resistant variants was lower than that of wild-type virus.\n\nCross-resistance\nTelaprevir-resistant variants were tested for cross-resistance against representative protease inhibitors\nin the HCV replicon system. Replicons with single substitutions at position 155 or 156 and double \nvariants with substitutions at residues 36 and 155 showed cross-resistance to all protease inhibitors \ntested with a wide range of sensitivities. All telaprevir-resistant variants studied remained fully \nsensitive to interferon-alfa, ribavirin, and representative HCV nucleoside and non-nucleoside \npolymerase inhibitors in the replicon system. There are no clinical data on re-treating patients who \nhave failed an HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitor-based therapy, such as telaprevir, nor are there data on \nrepeated courses of telaprevir treatment.\n\nClinical virology studies\nIn Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of telaprevir, treatment-na\u00efve and prior treatment-failure patients with \npredominant telaprevir-resistant variants at baseline (pre-treatment) were rare (V36M, T54A and \nR155K < 1% and T54S 2.7%). Predominant baseline resistance to telaprevir does not preclude \nsuccessful treatment with telaprevir, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin. The impact of predominant \ntelaprevir-resistant variants at baseline is likely greatest in patients with a poor interferon response, \nsuch as prior null responders.\n\nA total of 215 of 1,169 patients treated with a T12/PR regimen in a Phase 3 clinical trial had \non-treatment virologic failure (n = 125) or relapse (n = 90). Based on population sequencing analyses \nof HCV in these 215 patients, the emergence of telaprevir-resistant HCV variants was detected in \n105 (84%) virologic failures and in 55 (61%) relapsers, and wild-type virus was detected in 15 (12%) \nvirologic failures and in 24 (27%) relapsers. HCV sequencing data were not available for 16 (7%) \npatients. Sequence analyses of the telaprevir-resistant variants identified substitutions at 4 positions in \nthe NS3-4A protease region, consistent with the mechanism of action for telaprevir (V36A/M, \nT54A/S, R155K/T, and A156S/T/V). In the C211 Phase 3 clinical trial, there was no difference in the \ntype of emerging variants between patients receiving telaprevir 1,125 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) and \npatients receiving telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h). Similar proportions of patients in both \ntreatment groups had telaprevir-resistant variants at the time of failure. On-treatment virologic failure \nduring telaprevir treatment was predominantly associated with higher-level resistant variants, and \nrelapse was predominantly associated with lower-level resistant variants or wild-type virus.\n\nPatients with HCV genotype 1a predominately had V36M and R155K single and combination \nvariants, while patients with HCV genotype 1b predominately had V36A, T54A/S, and A156S/T/V \nvariants. This difference is likely due to the higher genetic barrier for the V36M and R155K \nsubstitutions for genotype 1b than genotype 1a. Among patients treated with telaprevir, on-treatment \nvirologic failure was more frequent in patients with genotype 1a than with genotype 1b and more \nfrequent in prior null responders than in other populations (treatment-na\u00efve, prior relapsers, prior \npartial responders; see section 5.1, Clinical Experience, Efficacy in Previously Treated Adults).\n\nThe resistance profile observed in Study HPC3008 in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients was similar to \nthe resistance profile in mono-infected HCV patients.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26\n\nThe resistance profile observed in Study HPC3006 in treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced \nHCV-1 infected liver transplant recipients who were on a stable regimen of the immunosuppressants \ntacrolimus or cyclosporine A was similar to the resistance profile in HCV-infected patients without a \nliver transplant.\n\nFollow-up analysis of INCIVO-treated patients who did not achieve an SVR showed that the \npopulation of wild-type virus increased and the population of telaprevir-resistant variants became\nundetectable over time after the end of telaprevir treatment. Of a combined 255 treatment-na\u00efve and \npreviously treated patients from Phase 3 studies 108, 111, and C216 in whom telaprevir-resistant \nvariants had emerged during treatment, 152 (60%) patients no longer had resistant variants detected \nby population sequencing (median follow-up of 10 months). Of the 393 resistant variants detected in \nthe 255 patients, 68% of NS3-36, 84% of NS3-54, 59% of NS3-155, 86% of NS3-156, and 52% of \nNS3-36M+NS3-155K variants were no longer detected.\n\nIn a follow-up study of 98 treatment-na\u00efve and prior treatment-failure patients who were treated with \na INCIVO regimen in a Phase 2 or Phase 3study and did not achieve SVR, telaprevir-resistant variants \nwere no longer detected in 85% (83/98) of patients (median follow-up of 27.5 months). Clonal \nsequencing analysis of a subset of patients who had wild-type HCV by population sequencing (n=20), \ncomparing the frequency of resistant variants before the start of telaprevir treatment and at follow-up, \nshowed that the HCV variant population in all patients had returned to pre-treatment levels. The \nmedian time for telaprevir-resistant variants to become undetectable by population sequencing was \nlonger for variants NS3-36 (6 months), NS3-155 (9 months) and NS3-36M+NS3-155K (12 months) \npredominantly observed in patients with genotype 1a than for variants NS3-54 (2 months) and \nNS3-156 (3 months) predominantly observed in patients with genotype 1b.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy and safety of INCIVO in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C were evaluated in \nfour Phase 3 studies: 3 in treatment-na\u00efve patients and 1 in previously treated patients (relapsers, \npartial responders, and null responders). Patients in these studies, 108, 111 and C216, had \ncompensated liver disease, detectable HCV RNA, and liver histopathology consistent with chronic \nhepatitis C. Unless otherwise indicated, INCIVO was administered at a dosage of 750 mg every \n8 hours (q8h); the peginterferon alfa-2a dose was 180 \u00b5g/week, and the ribavirin dose was \n1,000 mg/day (patients weighing < 75 kg) or 1,200 mg/day (patients weighing \u2265 75 kg). Plasma \nHCV RNA values were measured using the COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HCV test (version 2.0), for use with \nthe High Pure System. The assay had a lower limit of quantification of 25 IU/ml.\n\nIn the description of Phase 3 study outcomes for Studies 108, 111, and C216, SVR, considered \nvirologic cure, was defined based on the HCV RNA assessment in the study week 72 visit window, \nusing the last measurement in the window. In the case of missing data within the week 72 window, the \nlast HCV RNA data point from week 12 of follow-up onwards was used. In addition, the limit of \nquantification of 25 IU/ml was used to determine SVR.\n\nIn the description of the Phase 3 study outcomes for Study C211, HPC3008 and HPC3006, SVR12, \nconsidered virologic cure, was defined based on HCV RNA below the limit of quantification \n(25 IU/ml) using the last measurement in the visit window 12 weeks after the planned end of \ntreatment.\n\nEfficacy in treatment-na\u00efve adults\nStudy C211\nStudy C211 was a randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study conducted in treatment-na\u00efve patients who \nwere randomised to one of two treatment groups: INCIVO 750 mg every 8 hours [T12(q8h)/PR] or \nINCIVO 1,125 mg twice daily [T12(b.i.d.)/PR] in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and \nribavirin. The primary objective was to demonstrate the noninferiority of T12(b.i.d.)/PR over \nT12(q8h)/PR. All patients received 12 weeks of treatment with INCIVO in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. At week 12, INCIVO dosing ended and patients continued on \npeginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin treatment. The total treatment duration was determined based on \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27\n\nthe patients\u2019 individual on-treatment viral response. If a patient achieved undetectable HCV RNA \n(target not detected) at week 4, the total treatment duration was 24 weeks. Otherwise, the total \ntreatment duration was 48 weeks.\n\nThe 740 enrolled patients had a median age of 51 years (range: 18 to 70); 60% of the patients were \nmale; 21% had a body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2; 5% were Black; 2% were Asian; 85% had baseline \nHCV RNA levels \u2265 800,000 IU/ml; 15% had bridging fibrosis; 14% had cirrhosis; 57% had HCV \ngenotype 1a; and 43% had HCV genotype 1b.\n\nThe SVR12 rate for the T12(b.i.d.)/PR group was 74% (274/369) compared to 73% (270/371) in the \nT12(q8h)/PR group with 95% confidence interval of the difference: -4.9%, 12.0%. The lower limit of \nthe 95% CI (-4.9%) was greater than the pre-determined noninferiority margin of -11% and therefore \nthe non inferiority of T12(b.i.d.)/PR over T12(q8h)/PR was demonstrated.

All treatment regimens had a 48-week \nduration of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin treatment.\n\nThe 662 enrolled patients had a median age of 51 years (range: 21 to 70); 70% of the patients were \nmale; 26% had a body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2; 5% were Black; 11% were Hispanic or Latino; 89% \nhad baseline HCV RNA levels > 800,000 IU/ml; 22% had bridging fibrosis; 26% had cirrhosis; 54% \nhad HCV genotype 1a; and 46% had HCV genotype 1b.\n\nSVR rates for the T12(DS)/PR group were 88% (124/141) for prior relapsers, 56% (27/48) for prior \npartial responders, and 33% (25/75) for prior null responders.

In one of those studies, a telaprevir \n1,875 mg every 8 hours regimen was evaluated and the placebo-adjusted maximum mean increase in \nQTcF was 8.0 msec (90% CI: 5.1-10.9). Plasma concentrations with the telaprevir 1,875 mg every \n8 hours dose used in this trial were comparable to those observed in studies in HCV-infected patients \nwho received telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo clinical studies have been performed in paediatric patients.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nINCIVO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of telaprevir have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in \nsubjects with chronic HCV infection. Telaprevir can be administered orally with food as 375 mg\ntablets, 1,125 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 12 weeks, in combination with peginterferon alfa and \nribavirin. Alternatively, telaprevir can be administered orally with food as 375 mg tablets, 750 mg\nevery 8 hours (q8h) for 12 weeks, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Exposure to \ntelaprevir is higher during co-administration of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin than after \nadministration of telaprevir alone.\n\nTelaprevir exposure is comparable during co-administration with either peginterferon alfa-2a and \nribavirin or peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36\n\nAbsorption\nTelaprevir is orally available, most likely absorbed in the small intestine, with no evidence for \nabsorption in the colon. Maximum plasma concentrations after a single dose of telaprevir are \ngenerally achieved after 4 \u2013 5 hours. In vitro studies performed with human Caco-2 cells indicated \nthat telaprevir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp).\n\nTelaprevir exposure was similar regardless of whether the total daily dose of 2,250 mg was \nadministered as 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h) or 1,125 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). Based upon population \npharmacokinetic modelling of telaprevir steady-state exposures, the Geometric Mean Least Square \nRatios (90% CI) of 1,125 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) versus 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h) were 1.08 (1.02; \n1.13) for AUC24,ss, 0.878 (0.827; 0.930) for Ctrough,ss, and 1.18 (1.12;1.24) for Cmax,ss.\n\nThe exposure to telaprevir was increased by 20% when taken following a high-fat caloric meal (56 g \nfat, 928 kcal) compared to an intake following a standard normal caloric meal (21 g fat, 533 kcal). \nWhen compared to administration following a standard normal caloric meal, exposure (AUC)\ndecreased by 73% when telaprevir was taken on an empty stomach, by 26% following a low-calorie \nhigh-protein meal (9 g fat, 260 kcal), and by 39% following a low-calorie low-fat meal (3.6 g fat, \n249 kcal). Therefore, telaprevir should be taken with food.\n\nDistribution\nTelaprevir is approximately 59% to 76% bound to plasma proteins. Telaprevir binds primarily to \nalpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin.\n\nAfter oral administration, the typical apparent volume of distribution (Vd) was estimated to be 252 l, \nwith an inter-individual variability of 72.2%.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelaprevir is extensively metabolised in the liver, involving hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction. \nMultiple metabolites were detected in faeces, plasma, and urine. After repeated oral administration, \nR-diastereomer of telaprevir (30-fold less active), pyrazinoic acid, and a metabolite that underwent \nreduction at the \u03b1-ketoamide bond of telaprevir (not active) were found to be the predominant \nmetabolites of telaprevir.\n\nCYP3A4 is partly responsible for the metabolism of telaprevir. Other enzymes are also involved in the \nmetabolism such as aldo-ketoreductases and other proteolytic enzymes. Studies using recombinant\nhuman CYP supersomes showed that telaprevir was a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a time- and \nconcentration-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir was observed in human liver \nmicrosomes. No relevant inhibition by telaprevir of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 isozymes was observed in vitro. No relevant induction \nby telaprevir of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C, and CYP3A isozymes was observed in vitro. Based on \nthe results of drug-drug clinical interaction studies (e.g., escitalopram, zolpidem, ethinylestradiol), \ninduction of metabolic enzymes by telaprevir cannot be excluded.\n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that telaprevir is not an inhibitor of UGT1A9 or UGT2B7. In vitro\nstudies with recombinant UGT1A3 suggested that telaprevir may inhibit this enzyme. The clinical \nrelevance of this is uncertain as administration of telaprevir with a single dose of buprenorphine, a\npartial UGT1A3 substrate, to healthy adult subjects did not result in increases in buprenorphine \nexposures. No relevant inhibition by telaprevir of alcohol dehydrogenase was observed in vitro. \nHowever, sufficiently high concentrations were not tested for intestinal inhibition to be excluded.\n\nSuppression by telaprevir and VRT-127394 of CYP enzymes regulated via CAR, PXR and Ah nuclear \nreceptors was observed in vitro in human hepatocytes. Clinical drug-drug interaction studies with \nsubstrates of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and UGT1A1, UGT2B7 and UGT1A3 indicate \nno clinically relevant impact of the suppression observed in vitro. For other enzymes and transporters \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37\n\n(e.g., CYP1A1, CYP1A2, BCRP, OATPs) regulated by the same nuclear receptors, the potential \nclinical impact is unknown.\n\nTransporters\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that telaprevir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP2B1.\n\nNo relevant inhibition by telaprevir of the organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2 was observed in \nvitro.\n\nTelaprevir is a weak in vitro inhibitor of the transporters multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) \nMATE1 and MATE2-K with an IC50 of 28.3 \u03bcM and 32.5 \u03bcM, respectively. The clinical implications \nof this finding are currently unknown.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of a single oral dose of 750 mg 14C-telaprevir in healthy subjects, 90% of \ntotal radioactivity was recovered in faeces, urine and expired air within 96 hours post-dose. The \nmedian recovery of the administered radioactive dose was approximately 82% in the faeces, 9% in \nexhaled air and 1% in urine. The contribution of unchanged 14C \u2013 telaprevir and VRT-127394 towards \ntotal radioactivity recovered in faeces was 31.8% and 18.7%, respectively.\n\nAfter oral administration, the apparent total clearance (Cl/F) was estimated to be 32.4 l/h with an \ninter-individual variability of 27.2%. The mean elimination half-life after single-dose oral \nadministration of telaprevir 750 mg typically ranged from about 4.0 to 4.7 hours. At steady-state, the \neffective half-life is about 9-11 hours.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe exposure (AUC) to telaprevir increased slightly greater than proportionally to the dose after \nsingle-dose administration of 375 up to 1,875 mg with food, possibly due to saturation of metabolic \npathways or efflux transporters.\n\nAn increase in dose from 750 mg every 8 hours to 1,875 mg every 8 hours in a multiple-dose study \nresulted in a less than proportional increase (i.e., about 40%) in telaprevir exposure.\n\nSpecial populations\nPaediatric population\nData in the paediatric population are currently not available.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of telaprevir were assessed after administration of a single dose of 750 mg to \nHCV-negative subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/min). The mean telaprevir Cmax\nand AUC were 10% and 21% greater, respectively, compared to healthy subjects (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTelaprevir is primarily metabolised in the liver. Steady-state exposure to telaprevir was 15% lower in \nsubjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5-6) compared to healthy subjects. \nSteady-state exposure to telaprevir was 46% lower in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) compared to healthy subjects. Effect on unbound telaprevir \nconcentrations is unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nGender\nThe effect of subject gender on telaprevir pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population \npharmacokinetics of data from Phase 2 and 3 studies of INCIVO. No relevant effect of gender was \nidentified.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38\n\nRace\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of INCIVO in HCV-infected subjects indicated that the exposure \nto telaprevir was similar in Blacks/African-Americans and Caucasians.\n\nElderly\nThere is limited pharmacokinetic data on the use of INCIVO in HCV patients aged \u2265 65 years and no \ndata in subjects > 70 years of age.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology and/or pharmacology\nIn rats and dogs, telaprevir was associated with a reversible reduction of red blood cell parameters \naccompanied by a regenerative response. In both rats and dogs, AST/ALT elevations were observed in \nmost studies, of which the increase in ALT in rats was not normalised after recovery. \nHistopathological findings in the liver were similar in both rat and dog studies, of which not all were \nfully resolved after recovery. In rats (but not in dogs), telaprevir caused degenerative changes in testes \nwhich were reversible and did not affect fertility. In general, exposure levels in relation to human \nvalues were low in animal pharmacology and toxicology studies.\n\nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis\nTelaprevir has not been tested for its carcinogenic potential. Neither telaprevir nor its major \nmetabolite caused damage to DNA when tested in the standard battery of mutagenesis assays, in the \npresence and absence of metabolic activation.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nTelaprevir had no effects on fertility or fecundity when evaluated in rats.\n\nEmbryo-f\u0153tal development\nTelaprevir readily crosses the placenta in both rat and mouse giving a foetal: maternal exposure of \n19 - 50%. Telaprevir did not have any teratogenic potential in rat or mouse. In a fertility and early \nembryonic development study in rats, an increase in non-viable conceptuses was observed. Dosing of \nthe animals did not result in any exposure-margin when compared to human exposure.\n\nExcretion into milk\nWhen administered to lactating rats, levels of telaprevir and its major metabolite were higher in milk \ncompared to those observed in plasma. Rat offspring exposed to telaprevir in utero showed normal \nbody weight at birth. However, when fed via milk from telaprevir-treated dams, body weight gain of \nrat pups was lower than normal (likely due to taste aversion). After weaning, rat pup body weight gain \nreturned to normal.\n\n6.

What INCIVO is and what it is used for\n\nINCIVO acts against the virus that causes hepatitis C infection and is used to treat chronic hepatitis C \ninfection in adult patients (aged 18\u201365 years) in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. \nINCIVO contains a substance called telaprevir and belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018NS3-4A \nprotease inhibitors\u2019. The NS3-4A protease inhibitor reduces the amount of hepatitis C virus in your \nbody. INCIVO must not be taken alone and must be taken in combination with peginterferon alfa and \nribavirin to be sure your treatment works. INCIVO can be used for patients with chronic hepatitis C \ninfection who have never been treated before or can be used in patients with chronic hepatitis C \ninfection who have been treated previously with an interferon-based regimen.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take INCIVO\n\nDo not take INCIVO if you are allergic to telaprevir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine\n(listed in section 6).\n\nSee the package leaflets for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for a list of their contraindications (e.g. \npregnancy precautions for men and women) since INCIVO must be used in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about any contraindications \nmentioned in the package leaflets.\n\nDo not use INCIVO in combination with any of the following medicines as they may increase the \nrisk of severe side effects, and/or affect the way INCIVO or the other medicine works:\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n56\n\nMedicine (name of the active substance) Purpose of the medicine\nalfuzosin to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate \n\n(alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists)\n\namiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, other Class Ia\nor III antiarrhythmics\n\nto treat certain heart disorders such as irregular \nheart beat (antiarrhythmics)\n\nastemizole, terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms (antihistamines)\n\nrifampicin to treat some infections like tuberculosis \n(antimycobacterial)\n\ndihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine and headaches (ergot \nderivatives)\n\ncisapride to treat some stomach conditions \n(gastrointestinal motility agents)\n\nSt John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) an herbal product to relieve anxiety\n\natorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin to lower cholesterol levels (HMG CoA \nreductase inhibitors)\n\npimozide to treat psychiatric conditions (neuroleptics)\n\nsildenafil, tadalafil Sildenafil or tadalafil must not be used to treat a \nheart and lung disorder called pulmonary \narterial hypertension.

It is therefore very \nimportant that you read the package leaflets that are provided with these medicines, too. If you have \nany questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor treating your hepatitis C virus \n(HCV) if any of these apply to you.\n\n- Skin rash\nPatients taking INCIVO may develop a skin rash. There may be itching with the rash. Usually \nthe rash is mild or moderate, but the rash may be, or may become, severe and/or \nlife-threatening.

ribavirin for a list of their contraindications (e.g. pregnancy precautions for men and women) since incivo must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. ask your doctor if you are unsure about any contraindications mentioned in the package leaflets. do not use incivo in combination with any of the following medicines as they may increase the risk of severe side effects, and/or affect the way incivo or the other medicine works: 56 medicine (name of the active substance) purpose of the medicine alfuzosin to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate (alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists) amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, other class ia or iii antiarrhythmics to treat certain heart disorders such as irregular heart beat (antiarrhythmics) astemizole, terfenadine to treat

pharmacist before taking incivo. incivo must be taken in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. it is therefore very important that you read the package leaflets that are provided with these medicines, too. if you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor treating your hepatitis c virus (hcv) if any of these apply to you. - skin rash patients taking incivo may develop a skin rash. there may be itching with the rash. usually the rash is mild or moderate, but the rash may be, or may become, severe and/or life-threatening. you should contact your doctor immediately if you develop a rash or have a 57 rash that gets worse. incivo must not be restarted if discontinued by your doctor. you must carefully read the information under rash in section 4 possible side effects. - anaemia (decrease in your red blood cells) tell your doctor if you experience tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, light-headedness, and/or the feeling of the heart racing. these may be symptoms of anaemia. - heart problems tell your doctor if you have heart failure, irregular heartbeat, slow heart rate, an abnormality shown in your heart tracing (ecg) called 'long qt syndrome', or a family history of a heart condition called 'congenital qt syndrome'. your doctor may request additional monitoring during your incivo treatment. - liver problems tell your doctor if you have had other problems with your liver such as liver failure. signs might be yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), swelling of the stomach (ascites) or legs due to fluid, and bleeding from swollen veins (varices) in the gullet (oesophagus). your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take incivo. - infections tell your doctor if you have an hepatitis b infection so that your doctor can decide if incivo is right for you. - organ transplant tell your doctor if you have had or are going to have a liver or other organ transplant as incivo might not be right for you in this situation. blood tests your doctor will do blood tests before starting treatment and regularly during your treatment: - to see how much virus is in your blood and to determine if you have the type of virus (genotype 1) that can be treated with incivo. decisions related to your treatment may be made based on the results of these tests. your doctor will monitor your early response to treatment and how much virus is in your blood. if your treatment is not working, your doctor may stop your medicines. if your doctor stops incivo, it should not be restarted. - to check if you have anaemia (decrease in your red blood cells). - to check for changes in some values of your blood cells or chemistry. these can be seen in the results from blood tests. your doctor will explain these to you. examples are: blood count levels, thyroid (a gland in your neck that controls your metabolism) levels, liver and kidney tests. incivo has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. if you belong to this age group, please discuss the use of incivo with your doctor. children and adolescents incivo is not for use in children or adolescents, because it has not been sufficiently studied in patients under 18 years of age. other medicines and incivo

important to get the right levels of medicine in your body. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant, you must not take incivo. incivo must be used in combination with 59 peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. ribavirin can damage your unborn baby. it is therefore absolutely essential that you take all precautions not to get pregnant during this therapy. if you or your female partner become pregnant during incivo treatment or the months that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately (see section 'pregnancy precautions for men and women' below). if you are breast-feeding, you must stop breast-feeding before starting to take incivo. it is not known whether telaprevir, the active ingredient in incivo, is found in human breast milk. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. pregnancy precautions for men and women since incivo must be used in combination with ribavirin and ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, both female and male patients must take special precautions in order to prevent pregnancy. any birth control method can fail, and, therefore, you and your partner must use at least two effective birth control methods during incivo therapy and afterwards. following the end of the incivo treatment, please see the ribavirin package leaflet regarding continued contraception requirements. female patients of childbearing age and their male partners a hormonal contraceptive ('the pill') may not be reliable during the treatment with incivo. therefore, you and your partner must use two other birth control methods during the time you are taking incivo and for 2 months after stopping this medicine. you must read the package leaflets for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for additional information. driving and using machines some patients may experience fainting or problems with vision during incivo treatment. do not drive or operate machines if you feel faint or have problems with your vision while taking incivo. see also the package leaflets for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. incivo contains sodium this medicine contains 2.3 mg sodium per tablet, which should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. tell your doctor if you have to take care of your salt intake and follow a low sodium diet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "incivo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
