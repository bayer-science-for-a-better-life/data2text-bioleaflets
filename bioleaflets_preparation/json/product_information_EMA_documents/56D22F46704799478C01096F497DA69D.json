CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris \nIvabradine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in coronary \nartery disease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥ 70 bpm. Ivabradine is indicated : \n- in adults unable to tolerate or with a contraindication to the use of beta-blockers \n- or in combination with beta-blockers in patients inadequately controlled with an optimal beta-\n\nblocker dose. \n \nTreatment of chronic heart failure \nIvabradine is indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class with systolic dysfunction, in \npatients in sinus rhythm and whose heart rate is ≥ 75 bpm, in combination with standard therapy \nincluding beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated. (see \nsection 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n\n \nFor the different doses, film-coated tablets containing 5 mg and 7.5 mg ivabradine are available. \n \nSymptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris \nIt is recommended that the decision to initiate or titrate treatment takes place with the availability of \nserial heart rate measurements, ECG or ambulatory 24-hour monitoring. \nThe starting dose of ivabradine should not exceed 5 mg twice daily in patients aged below 75 years. \nAfter three to four weeks of treatment, if the patient is still symptomatic, if the initial dose is well \ntolerated and if resting heart rate remains above 60 bpm, the dose may be increased to the next higher \ndose in patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. The maintenance dose should not \nexceed 7.5 mg twice daily.  \nIf there is no improvement in symptoms of angina within 3 months after start of treatment, treatment of \nivabradine should be discontinued.  \nIn addition, discontinuation of treatment should be considered if there is only limited symptomatic \nresponse and when there is no clinically relevant reduction in resting heart rate within three months. \nIf, during treatment, heart rate decreases below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the patient \nexperiences symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must \nbe titrated downward including the lowest dose of 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice \ndaily). After dose reduction, heart rate should be monitored (see section 4.4). Treatment must be \ndiscontinued if heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist despite dose \nreduction. \n \nTreatment of chronic heart failure  \nThe treatment has to be initiated only in patient with stable heart failure. It is recommended that the \ntreating physician should be experienced in the management of chronic heart failure. \nThe usual recommended starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily. After two weeks of treatment, \nthe dose can be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily if resting heart rate is persistently above 60 bpm or \ndecreased to 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily) if resting heart rate is persistently \nbelow 50 bpm or in case of symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension. \nIf heart rate is between 50 and 60 bpm, the dose of 5 mg twice daily should be maintained.  \nIf during treatment, heart rate decreases persistently below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the \npatient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia, the dose must be titrated downward to the next \nlower dose in patients receiving 7.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. If heart rate increases \npersistently above 60 beats per minute at rest, the dose can be up titrated to the next upper dose in \npatients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. \nTreatment must be discontinued if heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia \npersist (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly \nIn patients aged 75 years or more, a lower starting dose should be considered (2.5 mg twice daily i.e. \none half 5 mg tablet twice daily) before up-titration if necessary. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance above \n15 ml/min (see section 5.2). \nNo data are available in patients with creatinine clearance below 15 ml/min. Ivabradine should \ntherefore be used with precaution in this population. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \nwhen using ivabradine in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Ivabradine is contraindicated for \n\n\n\n4 \n\nuse in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since it has not been studied in this population and a \nlarge increase in systemic exposure is anticipated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure in children aged below \n18 years have not yet been established. \nAvailable data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTablets must be taken orally twice daily, i.e. once in the morning and once in the evening during meals \n(see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Resting heart rate below 70 beats per minute prior to treatment \n- Cardiogenic shock \n- Acute myocardial infarction \n- Severe hypotension (< 90/50 mmHg) \n- Severe hepatic insufficiency \n- Sick sinus syndrome \n- Sino-atrial block \n- Unstable or acute heart failure \n- Pacemaker dependent (heart rate imposed exclusively by the pacemaker) \n- Unstable angina \n- AV-block of 3rd degree \n- Combination with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals \n\n(ketoconazole, itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, \njosamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.2) \n\n- Combination with verapamil or diltiazem which are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with heart rate \nreducing properties (see section 4.5) \n\n- Pregnancy, lactation and women of child-bearing potential not using appropriate contraceptive \nmeasures (see section 4.6) \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSpecial warnings \n \nLack of benefit on clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina pectoris \nIvabradine is indicated only for symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris because \nivabradine has no benefits on cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. myocardial infarction or cardiovascular \ndeath ) (see section 5.1).  \n \nMeasurement of heart rate \nGiven that the heart rate may fluctuate considerably over time, serial heart rate measurements, ECG or \nambulatory 24-hour monitoring should be considered when determining resting heart rate before \ninitiation of ivabradine treatment and in patients on treatment with ivabradine when titration is \nconsidered. This also applies to patients with a low heart rate, in particular when heart rate decreases \nbelow 50 bpm, or after dose reduction (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nIvabradine is not effective in the treatment or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and likely loses its \nefficacy when a tachyarrhythmia occurs (e.g. ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia). Ivabradine is \n\n\n\n5 \n\ntherefore not recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias that interfere \nwith sinus node function. \nIn patients treated with ivabradine the risk of developing atrial fibrillation is increased (see section \n4.8). Atrial fibrillation has been more common in patients using concomitantly amiodarone or potent \nclass I anti-arrhythmics. It is recommended to regularly clinically monitor ivabradine treated patients \nfor the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (sustained or paroxysmal), which should also include ECG \nmonitoring if clinically indicated (e.g. in case of exacerbated angina, palpitations, irregular pulse).  \nPatients should be informed of signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation and be advised to contact their \nphysician if these occur. \nIf atrial fibrillation develops during treatment, the balance of benefits and risks of continued ivabradine \ntreatment should be carefully reconsidered.  \nChronic heart failure patients with intraventricular conduction defects (bundle branch block left, \nbundle branch block right) and ventricular dyssynchrony should be monitored closely. \n \nUse in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree \nIvabradine is not recommended in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree. \n \nUse in patients with a low heart rate \nIvabradine must not be initiated in patients with a pre-treatment resting heart rate below 70 beats per \nminute (see section 4.3). \nIf, during treatment, resting heart rate decreases persistently below 50 bpm or the patient experiences \nsymptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated \ndownward or treatment discontinued if heart rate below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist \n(see section 4.2). \n \nCombination with calcium channel blockers \nConcomitant use of ivabradine with heart rate reducing calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or \ndiltiazem is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). No safety issue has been raised on the \ncombination of ivabradine with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as \namlodipine. Additional efficacy of ivabradine in combination with dihydropyridine calcium channel \nblockers has not been established (see section 5.1). \n \nChronic heart failure  \nHeart failure must be stable before considering ivabradine treatment. Ivabradine should be used with \ncaution in heart failure patients with NYHA functional classification IV due to limited amount of data \nin this population. \n \nStroke \nThe use of ivabradine is not recommended immediately after a stroke since no data is available in these \nsituations. \n \nVisual function \nIvabradine influences on retinal function. There is no evidence of a toxic effect of long-term ivabradine \ntreatment on the retina (see section 5.1). Cessation of treatment should be considered if any unexpected \ndeterioration in visual function occurs. Caution should be exercised in patients with retinitis \npigmentosa.  \n \nPrecautions for use \n \nPatients with hypotension \nLimited data are available in patients with mild to moderate hypotension, and ivabradine should \ntherefore be used with caution in these patients. Ivabradine is contraindicated in patients with severe \nhypotension (blood pressure < 90/50 mmHg) (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAtrial fibrillation - Cardiac arrhythmias \nThere is no evidence of risk of (excessive) bradycardia on return to sinus rhythm when \npharmacological cardioversion is initiated in patients treated with ivabradine. However, in the absence \nof extensive data, non urgent DC-cardioversion should be considered 24 hours after the last dose of \nivabradine. \n \nUse in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products \nThe use of ivabradine in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging \nmedicinal products should be avoided (see section 4.5). If the combination appears necessary, close \ncardiac monitoring is needed. \nHeart rate reduction, as caused by ivabradine, may exacerbate QT prolongation, which may give rise to \nsevere arrhythmias, in particular Torsade de pointes. \n \nHypertensive patients requiring blood pressure treatment modifications. \nIn the SHIFT trial more patients experienced episodes of increased blood pressure while treated with \nivabradine (7.1%) compared to patients treated with placebo (6.1%). These episodes occurred most \nfrequently shortly after blood pressure treatment was modified, were transient, and did not affect the \ntreatment effect of ivabradine. When treatment modifications are made in chronic heart failure patients \ntreated with ivabradine blood pressure should be monitored at an appropriate interval (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients \nSince tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nQT prolonging medicinal products  \n- Cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, bepridil, sotalol, \n\nibutilide, amiodarone). \n- Non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole, \n\nmefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine, cisapride, intravenous erythromycin). \nThe concomitant use of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products with \nivabradine should be avoided since QT prolongation may be exacerbated by heart rate reduction. If the \ncombination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use with precaution \nPotassium-depleting diuretics (thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics): hypokalemia can increase the risk \nof arrhythmia. As ivabradine may cause bradycardia, the resulting combination of hypokalemia and \nbradycardia is a predisposing factor to the onset of severe arrhythmias, especially in patients with long \nQT syndrome, whether congenital or substance-induced. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nCytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)  \nIvabradine is metabolised by CYP3A4 only and it is a very weak inhibitor of this cytochrome. \nIvabradine was shown not to influence the metabolism and plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 \nsubstrates (mild, moderate and strong inhibitors). CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are liable to interact \nwith ivabradine and influence its metabolism and pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. \nDrug-drug interaction studies have established that CYP3A4 inhibitors increase ivabradine plasma \nconcentrations, while inducers decrease them. Increased plasma concentrations of ivabradine may be \nassociated with the risk of excessive bradycardia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nContraindication of concomitant use \nThe concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, \nitraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), \nHIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone is contraindicated (see section 4.3). The \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) and josamycin (1 g twice daily) increased \nivabradine mean plasma exposure by 7 to 8 fold. \n \nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors: specific interaction studies in healthy volunteers and patients have \nshown that the combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents diltiazem or verapamil \nresulted in an increase in ivabradine exposure (2 to 3 fold increase in AUC) and an additional heart rate \nreduction of 5 bpm. The concomitant use of ivabradine with these medicinal products is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nGrapefruit juice: ivabradine exposure was increased by 2-fold following the co-administration with \ngrapefruit juice. Therefore the intake of grapefruit juice should be avoided. \n \nConcomitant use with precautions \n- Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: the concomitant use of ivabradine with other moderate CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors (e.g. fluconazole) may be considered at the starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and if \nresting heart rate is above 70 bpm, with monitoring of heart rate. \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers: CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, Hypericum \nperforatum [St John’s Wort]) may decrease ivabradine exposure and activity. The concomitant use \nof CYP3A4 inducing medicinal products may require an adjustment of the dose of ivabradine. The \ncombination of ivabradine 10 mg twice daily with St John’s Wort was shown to reduce ivabradine \nAUC by half. The intake of St John’s Wort should be restricted during the treatment with \nivabradine. \n\n \nOther concomitant use \nSpecific drug-drug interaction studies have shown no clinically significant effect of the following \nmedicinal products on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivabradine: proton pump inhibitors \n(omeprazole, lansoprazole), sildenafil, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin), dihydropyridine \ncalcium channel blockers (amlodipine, lacidipine), digoxin and warfarin. In addition there was no \nclinically significant effect of ivabradine on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, amlodipine, \nlacidipine, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin and on the \npharmacodynamics of aspirin. \nIn pivotal phase III clinical trials the following medicinal products were routinely combined with \nivabradine with no evidence of safety concerns: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin \nII antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretics, anti-aldosterone agents, short and long acting nitrates, HMG \nCoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, proton pump inhibitors, oral antidiabetics, aspirin and other anti-\nplatelet medicinal products. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of child-bearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures during treatment (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ivabradine in pregnant women.  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. These studies have shown embryotoxic and \nteratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, ivabradine \nis contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nAnimal studies indicate that ivabradine is excreted in milk. Therefore, ivabradine is contraindicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \nWomen that need treatment with ivabradine should stop breast-feeding, and choose for another way of \nfeeding their child. \n \nFertility \nStudies in rats have shown no effect on fertility in males and females (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nA specific study to assess the possible influence of ivabradine on driving performance has been \nperformed in healthy volunteers where no alteration of the driving performance was evidenced. \nHowever, in post-marketing experience, cases of impaired driving ability due to visual symptoms have \nbeen reported. Ivabradine may cause transient luminous phenomena consisting mainly of phosphenes \n(see section 4.8). The possible occurrence of such luminous phenomena should be taken into account \nwhen driving or using machines in situations where sudden variations in light intensity may occur, \nespecially when driving at night. \nIvabradine has no influence on the ability to use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIvabradine has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 45,000 participants.  \nThe most common adverse reactions with ivabradine, luminous phenomena (phosphenes) and \nbradycardia, are dose dependent and related to the pharmacological effect of the medicinal product. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical trials and are ranked using the \nfollowing frequency: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Preferred Term \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Eosinophilia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Hyperuricaemia \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache, generally during the first month \nof treatment \nDizziness, possibly related to bradycardia \n\nUncommon* Syncope, possibly related to bradycardia \nEye disorders Very common Luminous phenomena (phosphenes) \n\nCommon Blurred vision \nUncommon* Diplopia \n\nVisual impairment \nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon Vertigo \nCardiac disorders Common Bradycardia \n\nAV 1st degree block (ECG prolonged PQ \ninterval) \nVentricular extrasystoles \nAtrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Palpitations, supraventricular extrasystoles \nVery rare AV 2nd degree block, AV 3rd degree block \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSick sinus syndrome \nVascular disorders Common Uncontrolled blood pressure \n\nUncommon* Hypotension, possibly related to bradycardia\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea \nConstipation \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon* Angioedema \nRash \n\nRare* Erythema \nPruritus \nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Muscle spasms \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon* Asthenia, possibly related to bradycardia \n\nFatigue, possibly related to bradycardia \nRare* Malaise, possibly related to bradycardia \n\nInvestigations Uncommon Elevated creatinine in blood \nECG prolonged QT interval \n\n* Frequency calculated from clinical trials for adverse events detected from spontaneous report \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nLuminous phenomena (phosphenes) were reported by 14.5% of patients, described as a transient \nenhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field. They are usually triggered by sudden \nvariations in light intensity. Phosphenes may also be described as a halo, image decomposition \n(stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic effects), coloured bright lights, or multiple image (retinal persistency). \nThe onset of phosphenes is generally within the first two months of treatment after which they may \noccur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity. All \nphosphenes resolved during or after treatment, of which a majority (77.5%) resolved during treatment. \nFewer than 1% of patients changed their daily routine or discontinued the treatment in relation with \nphosphenes. \n \nBradycardia was reported by 3.3% of patients particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of treatment \ninitiation. 0.5% of patients experienced a severe bradycardia below or equal to 40 bpm.  \n \nIn the SIGNIFY study atrial fibrillation was observed in 5.3% of patients taking ivabradine compared \nto 3.8% in the placebo group. In a pooled analysis of all the Phase II/III double blind controlled \nclinical trials with a duration of at least 3 months including more than 40,000 patients, the incidence of \natrial fibrillation was 4.86% in ivabradine treated patients compared to 4.08% in controls, \ncorresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.26, 95% CI [1.15-1.39]. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nOverdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nManagement \nSevere bradycardia should be treated symptomatically in a specialised environment. In the event of \nbradycardia with poor haemodynamic tolerance, symptomatic treatment including intravenous beta-\nstimulating medicinal products such as isoprenaline may be considered. Temporary cardiac electrical \npacing may be instituted if required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB17. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIvabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent, acting by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac \npacemaker If current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in the sinus node and \nregulates heart rate. The cardiac effects are specific to the sinus node with no effect on intra-atrial, \natrioventricular or intraventricular conduction times, nor on myocardial contractility or ventricular \nrepolarisation. \n \nIvabradine can interact also with the retinal current Ih which closely resembles cardiac If. It participates \nin the temporal resolution of the visual system, by curtailing the retinal response to bright light stimuli. \nUnder triggering circumstances (e.g. rapid changes in luminosity), partial inhibition of Ih by ivabradine \nunderlies the luminous phenomena that may be occasionally experienced by patients. Luminous \nphenomena (phosphenes) are described as a transient enhanced brightness in a limited area of the \nvisual field (see section 4.8). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe main pharmacodynamic property of ivabradine in humans is a specific dose dependent reduction \nin heart rate. Analysis of heart rate reduction with doses up to 20 mg twice daily indicates a trend \ntowards a plateau effect which is consistent with a reduced risk of severe bradycardia below 40 bpm \n(see section 4.8). \nAt usual recommended doses, heart rate reduction is approximately 10 bpm at rest and during exercise. \nThis leads to a reduction in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption. Ivabradine does \nnot influence intracardiac conduction, contractility (no negative inotropic effect) or ventricular \nrepolarisation: \n- in clinical electrophysiology studies, ivabradine had no effect on atrioventricular or intraventricular \n\nconduction times or corrected QT intervals; \n- in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 30 \n\nand 45%), ivabradine did not have any deleterious influence on LVEF. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was studied in five double-blind randomised \ntrials (three versus placebo, and one each versus atenolol and amlodipine). These trials included a total \nof 4,111 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, of whom 2,617 received ivabradine. \n \nIvabradine 5 mg twice daily was shown to be effective on exercise test parameters within 3 to 4 weeks \nof treatment. Efficacy was confirmed with 7.5 mg twice daily. In particular, the additional benefit over \n5 mg twice daily was established in a reference-controlled study versus atenolol: total exercise \nduration at trough was increased by about 1 minute after one month of treatment with 5 mg twice daily \nand further improved by almost 25 seconds after an additional 3-month period with forced titration to \n7.5 mg twice daily. In this study, the antianginal and anti-ischaemic benefits of ivabradine were \n\n\n\n11 \n\nconfirmed in patients aged 65 years or more. The efficacy of 5 and 7.5 mg twice daily was consistent \nacross studies on exercise test parameters (total exercise duration, time to limiting angina, time to \nangina onset and time to 1 mm ST segment depression) and was associated with a decrease of about \n70% in the rate of angina attacks. The twice-daily dosing regimen of ivabradine gave uniform efficacy \nover 24 hours. \n \nIn a 889-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine given on top of atenolol 50 mg o.d. \nshowed additional efficacy on all ETT parameters at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral \nintake). \n \nIn a 725-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on \ntop of amlodipine 10 mg o.d. at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral intake) while an \nadditional efficacy was shown at peak (3-4 hours after oral intake). \n \nIn a 1277-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant additional efficacy on response to treatment (defined as a decrease of at least 3 angina \nattacks per week and/or an increase in the time to 1 mm ST segment depression of at least 60 s during a \ntreadmill ETT) on top of amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or nifedipine GITS 30 mg o.d. at the trough of drug \nactivity (12 hours after oral ivabradine intake) over a 6-week treatment period (OR = 1.3, 95% CI \n[1.0–1.7]; p=0.012). Ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on secondary endpoints of ETT \nparameters at the trough of drug activity while an additional efficacy was shown at peak (3-4 hours \nafter oral ivabradine intake). \n \nIvabradine efficacy was fully maintained throughout the 3- or 4-month treatment periods in the \nefficacy trials. There was no evidence of pharmacological tolerance (loss of efficacy) developing \nduring treatment nor of rebound phenomena after abrupt treatment discontinuation. The antianginal \nand anti-ischaemic effects of ivabradine were associated with dose-dependent reductions in heart rate \nand with a significant decrease in rate pressure product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure) at rest and \nduring exercise. The effects on blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance were minor and not \nclinically significant. \n \nA sustained reduction of heart rate was demonstrated in patients treated with ivabradine for at least one \nyear (n = 713). No influence on glucose or lipid metabolism was observed. \n \nThe antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was preserved in diabetic patients (n = 457) \nwith a similar safety profile as compared to the overall population. \n \nA large outcome study, BEAUTIFUL, was performed in 10917 patients with coronary artery disease \nand left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF<40%) on top of optimal background therapy with 86.9% of \npatients receiving beta-blockers. The main efficacy criterion was the composite of cardiovascular \ndeath, hospitalization for acute MI or hospitalization for new onset or worsening heart failure. The \nstudy showed no difference in the rate of the primary composite outcome in the ivabradine group by \ncomparison to the placebo group (relative risk ivabradine:placebo 1.00, p=0.945).  \nIn a post-hoc subgroup of patients with symptomatic angina at randomisation (n=1507), no safety \nsignal was identified regarding cardiovascular death, hospitalization for acute MI or heart failure \n(ivabradine 12.0% versus placebo 15.5%, p=0.05).  \n \nA large outcome study, SIGNIFY, was performed in 19102 patients with coronary artery disease and \nwithout clinical heart failure (LVEF > 40%), on top of optimal background therapy. A therapeutic \nscheme higher than the approved posology was used (starting dose 7.5 mg b.i.d. (5 mg b.i.d, if age ≥ \n75 years) and titration up to 10 mg b.i.d). The main efficacy criterion was the composite of \ncardiovascular death or non-fatal MI. The study showed no difference in the rate of the primary \ncomposite endpoint (PCE) in the ivabradine group by comparison to the placebo group (relative risk \nivabradine/placebo 1.08, p=0.197). Bradycardia was reported by 17.9 % of patients in the ivabradine \n\n\n\n12 \n\ngroup (2.1% in the placebo group). Verapamil, diltiazem or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors were received \nby 7.1% of patients during the study. \nA small statistically significant increase in the PCE was observed in a pre-specified subgroup of \npatients with angina patients in CCS class II or higher at baseline (n=12049) (annual rates 3.4% versus \n2.9%, relative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.18, p=0.018), but not in the subgroup of the overall angina \npopulation in CCS class ≥ I (n=14286) (relative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.11, p=0.110). \nThe higher than approved dose used in the study did not fully explain these findings. \n \nThe SHIFT study was a large multicentre, international, randomised double-blind placebo controlled \noutcome trial conducted in 6505 adult patients with stable chronic CHF (for  4 weeks), NYHA class \nII to IV, with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF  35%) and a resting heart rate  70 \nbpm. \nPatients received standard care including beta-blockers (89 %), ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II \nantagonists (91 %), diuretics (83 %), and anti-aldosterone agents (60 %). In the ivabradine group, 67% \nof patients were treated with 7.5 mg twice a day. The median follow-up duration was 22.9 months. \nTreatment with ivabradine was associated with an average reduction in heart rate of 15 bpm from a \nbaseline value of 80 bpm. The difference in heart rate between ivabradine and placebo arms was 10.8 \nbpm at 28 days, 9.1 bpm at 12 months and 8.3 bpm at 24 months. \n \nThe study demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant relative risk reduction of 18% in the \nrate of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation for worsening \nheart failure (hazard ratio: 0.82, 95%CI [0.75;0.90] – p<0.0001) apparent within 3 months of initiation \nof treatment. The absolute risk reduction was 4.2%. The results on the primary endpoint are mainly \ndriven by the heart failure endpoints, hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (absolute risk reduced \nby 4.7 %) and deaths from heart failure (absolute risk reduced by 1.1 %).  \n \nTreatment effect on the primary composite endpoint, its components and secondary endpoints \n \n\n Ivabradine \n(N=3241) \n\nn (%)  \n\nPlacebo \n(N=3264) \n\nn (%) \n\nHazard ratio \n[95% CI] \n\np-value \n\nPrimary composite endpoint 793 (24.47) 937 (28.71) 0.82 [0.75; 0.90] <0.0001 \nComponents of the composite: \n- CV death \n- Hospitalisation for worsening \nHF \n\n \n449 (13.85) \n514 (15.86) \n\n \n\n \n491 (15.04) \n672 (20.59) \n\n \n\n \n0.91 [0.80; 1.03] \n0.74 [0.66; 0.83] \n\n \n\n \n0.128 \n\n<0.0001 \n \n\nOther secondary endpoints: \n- All cause death \n- Death from HF \n- Hospitalisation for any cause \n- Hospitalisation for CV reason \n \n\n \n503 (15.52) \n113 (3.49) \n\n1231 (37.98) \n977 (30.15) \n\n \n\n \n552 (16.91) \n151 (4.63) \n\n1356 (41.54) \n1122 (34.38) \n\n \n\n \n0.90 [0.80; 1.02] \n0.74 [0.58;0.94] \n0.89 [0.82;0.96] \n0.85 [0.78; 0.92] \n\n \n\n \n0.092 \n0.014 \n0.003 \n\n0.0002 \n \n\n \nThe reduction in the primary endpoint was observed consistently irrespective of gender, NYHA class, \nischaemic or non-ischaemic heart failure aetiology and of background history of diabetes or \nhypertension. \n \nIn the subgroup of patients with HR ≥ 75 bpm (n=4150), a greater reduction was observed in the \nprimary composite endpoint of 24 % (hazard ratio: 0.76, 95%CI [0.68;0.85] – p<0.0001) and for other \nsecondary endpoints, including all cause death (hazard ratio: 0.83, 95%CI [0.72;0.96] – p=0.0109) and \nCV death (hazard ratio: 0.83, 95%CI [0.71;0.97] – p=0.0166). In this subgroup of patients, the safety \nprofile of ivabradine is in line with the one of the overall population.  \n \nA significant effect was observed on the primary composite endpoint in the overall group of patients \nreceiving beta blocker therapy (hazard ratio: 0.85, 95%CI [0.76;0.94]). In the subgroup of patients with \nHR ≥ 75 bpm and on the recommended target dose of beta-blocker, no statistically significant benefit \n\n\n\n13 \n\nwas observed on the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio: 0.97, 95%CI [0.74;1.28]) and other \nsecondary endpoints, including hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (hazard ratio: 0.79, 95% CI \n[0.56;1.10]) or death from heart failure (hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI [0.31;1.53]). \n \nThere was a significant improvement in NYHA class at last recorded value, 887 (28%) of patients on \nivabradine improved versus 776 (24%) of patients on placebo (p=0.001). \n \nIn a 97-patient randomised placebo-controlled study, the data collected during specific ophthalmologic \ninvestigations, aiming at documenting the function of the cone and rod systems and the ascending \nvisual pathway (i.e. electroretinogram, static and kinetic visual fields, colour vision, visual acuity), in \npatients treated with ivabradine for chronic stable angina pectoris over 3 years, did not show any \nretinal toxicity. \n \nPaediatric population \nA randomised, double blind, placebo controlled  study was performed in 116 paediatric patients (17 \naged [6-12]months, 36 aged [1-3] years and 63 aged [3-18] years) with CHF and dilated \ncardiomyopathy (DCM) on top of optimal background treatment. 74 received ivabradine (ratio 2:1).  \nThe starting dose was 0.02 mg/kg bid in age-subset [6-12]months, 0.05 mg/kg bid in [1-3] years and \n[3-18] years <40 kg, and 2.5 mg bid in [3-18] years and ≥ 40 kg. The dose was adapted depending on \nthe therapeutic response with maximum doses of 0.2 mg/kg bid, 0.3 mg/kg bid and 15 mg bid \nrespectively. In this study, ivabradine was administered as oral liquid formulation or tablet twice daily. \nThe absence of pharmacokinetic difference between the 2 formulations was shown in an open-label \nrandomised two-period cross-over study in 24 adult healthy volunteers. \nA 20% heart rate reduction, without bradycardia, was achieved by 69.9% of patients in the ivabradine \ngroup versus 12.2% in the placebo group during the titration period  of 2 to 8 weeks (Odds Ratio: E = \n17.24, 95% CI [5.91 ; 50.30]).  \nThe mean ivabradine doses allowing to achieve a 20% HRR were 0.13 ± 0.04 mg/kg bid, 0.10 ± 0.04 \nmg/kg bid and 4.1 ± 2.2 mg bid in the age subsets [1-3] years, [3-18] years and <40 kg and [3-18] \nyears and ≥ 40 kg, respectively. \nMean LVEF increased from 31.8% to 45.3% at M012 in ivabradine group versus 35.4% to 42.3% in \nthe placebo group. There was an improvement in NYHA class in 37.7% of ivabradine patients versus \n25.0% in the placebo group. These improvements were not statistically significant. \nThe safety profile, over one year, was similar to the one described in adult CHF patients. \n \nThe long-term effects of ivabradine on growth, puberty and general development as well as the long-\nterm efficacy of therapy with ivabradine in childhood to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality \nhave not been studied. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIvabradine film-coated tablets in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of angina \npectoris.  \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIvabradine film-coated tabletsin children aged 0 to less than 6 months in the treatment of chronic heart \nfailure.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nUnder physiological conditions, ivabradine is rapidly released from tablets and is highly water-soluble \n(>10 mg/ml). Ivabradine is the S-enantiomer with no bioconversion demonstrated in vivo. The N-\ndesmethylated derivative of ivabradine has been identified as the main active metabolite in humans. \n \nAbsorption and bioavailability \nIvabradine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma \nlevel reached in about 1 hour under fasting condition. The absolute bioavailability of the film-coated \ntablets is around 40%, due to first-pass effect in the gut and liver.  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nFood delayed absorption by approximately 1 hour, and increased plasma exposure by 20 to 30 %. The \nintake of the tablet during meals is recommended in order to decrease intra-individual variability in \nexposure (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nIvabradine is approximately 70% plasma protein bound and the volume of distribution at steady-state \nis close to 100 l in patients. The maximum plasma concentration following chronic administration at \nthe recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily is 22 ng/ml (CV=29%). The average plasma concentration \nis 10 ng/ml (CV=38%) at steady-state. \n \nBiotransformation \nIvabradine is extensively metabolised by the liver and the gut by oxidation through cytochrome P450 \n3A4 (CYP3A4) only. The major active metabolite is the N-desmethylated derivative (S 18982) with an \nexposure about 40% of that of the parent compound. The metabolism of this active metabolite also \ninvolves CYP3A4. Ivabradine has low affinity for CYP3A4, shows no clinically relevant CYP3A4 \ninduction or inhibition and is therefore unlikely to modify CYP3A4 substrate metabolism or plasma \nconcentrations. Inversely, potent inhibitors and inducers may substantially affect ivabradine plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nIvabradine is eliminated with a main half-life of 2 hours (70-75% of the AUC) in plasma and an \neffective half-life of 11 hours. The total clearance is about 400 ml/min and the renal clearance is about \n70 ml/min. Excretion of metabolites occurs to a similar extent via faeces and urine. About 4% of an \noral dose is excreted unchanged in urine. \n \nLinearity/non linearity \nThe kinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5 – 24 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n- Elderly: no pharmacokinetic differences (AUC and Cmax) have been observed between elderly (≥ \n\n65 years) or very elderly patients (≥ 75 years) and the overall population (see section 4.2). \n- Renal impairment: the impact of renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 15 to 60 ml/min) on \n\nivabradine pharmacokinetic is minimal, in relation with the low contribution of renal clearance \n(about 20 %) to total elimination for both ivabradine and its main metabolite S 18982 (see section \n4.2). \n\n- Hepatic impairment: in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score up to 7) unbound \nAUC of ivabradine and the main active metabolite were about 20% higher than in subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. Data are insufficient to draw conclusions in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n4.3). \n\n- Paediatric population: The pharmacokinetic profile of ivabradine in paediatric chronic heart failure \npatients aged 6 months to less than 18 years is similar to the pharmacokinetics described in adults \nwhen a titration scheme based on age and weight is applied. \n\n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship \nPK/PD relationship analysis has shown that heart rate decreases almost linearly with increasing \nivabradine and S 18982 plasma concentrations for doses of up to 15-20 mg twice daily. At higher \ndoses, the decrease in heart rate is no longer proportional to ivabradine plasma concentrations and \ntends to reach a plateau. High exposures to ivabradine that may occur when ivabradine is given in \ncombination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an excessive decrease in heart rate although \nthis risk is reduced with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). The PK/PD \nrelationship of ivabradine in paediatric chronic heart failure patients aged 6 months to less than 18 \nyears is similar to the PK/PD relationship described in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Reproductive toxicity \nstudies showed no effect of ivabradine on fertility in male and female rats. When pregnant animals \nwere treated during organogenesis at exposures close to therapeutic doses, there was a higher incidence \nof foetuses with cardiac defects in the rat and a small number of foetuses with ectrodactylia in the \nrabbit. \nIn dogs given ivabradine (doses of 2, 7 or 24 mg/kg/day) for one year, reversible changes in retinal \nfunction were observed but were not associated with any damage to ocular structures. These data are \nconsistent with the pharmacological effect of ivabradine related to its interaction with \nhyperpolarisation-activated Ih currents in the retina, which share extensive homology with the cardiac \npacemaker If current. \nOther long-term repeat dose and carcinogenicity studies revealed no clinically relevant changes. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe environmental risk assessment of ivabradine has been conducted in accordance to European \nguidelines on ERA. \nOutcomes of these evaluations support the lack of  environmental risk of ivabradine and ivabradine \ndoes not pose a threat to the environment. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ivabradine Accord is and what it is used for \n \nIvabradine Accord  is a heart medicine used to treat: \n- Symptomatic stable angina pectoris (which causes chest pain) in adult patients whose heart rate is \n\nover or equal to 70 beats per minute. It is used in adult patients who do not tolerate or cannot take \nheart medicines called beta-blockers. It is also used in combination with beta-blockers in adult \npatients whose condition is not fully controlled with a beta-blocker. \n\n- Chronic heart failure in adult patients whose heart rate is over or equal to 75 beats per minute. It is \nused in combination with standard therapy, including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blockers \nare contraindicated or not tolerated. \n\n \nAbout stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as “angina”): \nStable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen. It \nusually appears between 40 and 50 years of age. The most common symptom of angina is chest pain or \ndiscomfort. Angina is more likely to happen when the heart beats faster in situations such as exercise, \nemotion, exposure to the cold or after eating. This increase in heart rate can cause the chest pain in \npeople who suffer from angina. \n \nAbout chronic heart failure : \nChronic heart failure is a heart disease which happens when your heart cannot pump enough blood to \nthe rest of your body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, \ntiredness and ankle swelling. \n \nHow does Ivabradine Accord work? \nIvabradine Accord mainly works by reducing the heart rate by a few beats per minute. This lowers the \nheart’s need for oxygen especially in the situations when an angina attack is more likely to happen. In \nthis way Ivabradine Accord helps to control and reduce the number of angina attacks.  \nFurthermore as elevated heart rate adversely affects the heart functioning and vital prognosis in \npatients with chronic heart failure, the specific heart rate lowering action of ivabradine helps to \nimprove the heart functioning and vital prognosis in these patients. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ivabradine Accord \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nDo not take Ivabradine Accord \n- if you are allergic to ivabradine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6); \n- if your resting heart rate before treatment is too slow (below 70 beats per minute); \n- if you are suffering from cardiogenic shock (a heart condition treated in hospital); \n- if you suffer from a heart rhythm disorder; \n- if you are having a heart attack; \n- if you suffer from very low blood pressure; \n- if you suffer from unstable angina (a severe form in which chest pain occurs very frequently and \n\nwith or without exertion); \n- if you have heart failure which has recently become worse; \n- if your heartbeat is exclusively imposed by your pacemaker; \n- if you suffer from severe liver problems; \n- if you are already taking medicines for the treatment of fungal infections (such as ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (such as josamycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin or \nerythromycin given orally), medicines to treat HIV infections (such as nelfinavir, ritonavir) or \nnefazodone (medicine to treat depression) or diltiazem, verapamil (used for high blood pressure or \nangina pectoris); \n\n- if you are a woman able to have children and not using reliable contraception; \n- if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant; \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ivabradine Accord \n- if you suffer from heart rhythm disorders (such as irregular heartbeat, palpitation, increase in chest \n\npain) or sustained atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat), or an abnormality of \nelectrocardiogram (ECG) called ‘long QT syndrome’, \n\n- if you have symptoms such as tiredness, dizziness or shortness of breath (this could mean that your \nheart is slowing down too much), \n\n- if you suffer from symptoms of atrial fibrillation (pulse rate at rest unusually high (over 110 beats \nper minute) or irregular, without any apparent reason, making it difficult to measure), \n\n- if you have had a recent stroke (cerebral attack), \n- if you suffer from mild to moderate low blood pressure, \n- if you suffer from uncontrolled blood pressure, especially after a change in your antihypertensive \n\ntreatment, \n- if you suffer from severe heart failure or heart failure with abnormality of ECG called ‘bundle \n\nbranch block’, \n- if you suffer from chronic eye retinal disease, \n- if you suffer from moderate liver problems, \n- if you suffer from severe renal problems. \nIf any of the above applies to you, talk straight away to your doctor before or while taking Ivabradine \nAccord. \n \nChildren \nIvabradine Accord is not intended for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Ivabradine Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nMake sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, as a dose adjustment of \nIvabradine Accord or monitoring should be required: \n- fluconazole (an antifungal medicine) \n- rifampicin (an antibiotic) \n- barbiturates (for difficult sleeping or epilepsy) \n- phenytoin (for epilepsy) \n\n\n\n28 \n\n- Hypericum perforatum or St John’s Wort (herbal treatment for depression) \n- QT prolonging medicines to treat either heart rhythm disorders or other conditions : \n\n- quinidine, disopyramide, ibutilide, sotalol, amiodarone (to treat heart rhythm disorders) \n- bepridil (to treat angina pectoris) \n- certain types of medicines to treat anxiety, schizophrenia or other psychoses (such as pimozide, \n\nziprasidone, sertindole) \n- anti-malarial medicines (such as mefloquine or halofantrine) \n- intravenous erythromycin (an antibiotic) \n- pentamidine (an antiparasitic medicine) \n- cisapride (against the gastro-oesophageal reflux) \n\n- Some types of diuretics which may cause decrease in blood potassium level, such as furosemide, \nhydrochlorothiazide, indapamide (used to treat oedema, high blood pressure). \n\n \nIvabradine Accord with food and drink  \nAvoid grapefruit juice during treatment with Ivabradine Accord. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Ivabradine Accord if you are pregnant or are planning to have a baby (see “Do not take \nIvabradine Accord”).  \nIf you are pregnant and have taken Ivabradine Accord, talk to your doctor. \nDo not take Ivabradine Accord if you are able to become pregnant unless you use reliable \ncontraceptive measures (see “Do not take Ivabradine Accord”). \nDo not take Ivabradine Accord if you are breast-feeding (see “Do not take Ivabradine Accord”).
