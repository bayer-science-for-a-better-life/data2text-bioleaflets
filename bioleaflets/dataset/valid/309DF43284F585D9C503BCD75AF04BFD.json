NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nValtropin 5 mg/1.5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of powder contains 5 mg somatropin (corresponding to 15 IU). \n \nAfter reconstitution with 1.5 ml solvent, 1 ml contains: \nsomatropin* 3.33 mg (corresponding to 10 IU) \n* produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nWhite or almost white powder. The solvent is a clear solution. \n \nAfter reconstitution with the solvent provided, Valtropin has a pH of approximately 7.5 and an \nosmolality of approximately 320 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPaediatric population \n- Long-term treatment of children (2 to 11 years old) and adolescents (12 to 18 years old) with \n\ngrowth failure due to an inadequate secretion of normal endogenous growth hormone. \n- Treatment of short stature in children with Turner syndrome, confirmed by chromosome \n\nanalysis. \n- Treatment of growth retardation in pre-pubertal children with chronic renal insufficiency. \n \nAdult patients \n- Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency of either childhood- \n\nor adult-onset aetiology. \n \nPatients with severe growth hormone deficiency in adulthood are defined as patients with known \nhypothalamic-pituitary pathology and at least one additional known deficiency of a pituitary hormone \nnot being prolactin. These patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or \nexclude a growth hormone deficiency. In patients with childhood-onset isolated growth hormone \ndeficiency (no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease or cranial irradiation), two dynamic tests \nshould be recommended, except for those having low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) \nconcentrations (< 2 standard deviation score (SDS)), who may be considered for one test. The cut-off \npoint of the dynamic test should be strict. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy with Valtropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians adequately experienced in the \ndiagnosis and management of patients with growth hormone deficiency. \n \nPosology \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nThe dosage and administration schedule should be individualised for each patient. \n \nDosage in paediatric population \n \nGrowth hormone deficiency in children \nThe recommended dosage is 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day. \n \nChildren with Turner syndrome \nThe recommended dosage is 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day, given as a subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \nPre-pubertal children with chronic renal insufficiency \nThe recommended dosage is 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day, given as a subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \nDosage in adult patients \n \nGrowth hormone deficiency in adults \nThe recommended starting dose is 0.15 - 0.30 mg/day, given as a subcutaneous injection. A lower \nstarting dose may be necessary in older and obese patients. \n \nThis dose should be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements based on the \nclinical response and serum IGF-1 concentrations. Total daily dose usually does not exceed 1 mg. \nIGF-1 concentrations should be maintained below the upper limit of the age-specific normal range. \n \nThe minimum effective dose should be used. \n \nThe dosage of somatropin should be decreased in cases of persistent oedema or severe paresthesia, in \norder to avoid the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. \n \nExperience of prolonged treatment (over 5 years) with somatropin in adults is limited. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nExperience of somatropin treatment in patients above 60 years of age is limited. A lower starting dose \nmay be necessary in older patients. Dose requirements may decline with increasing age. \n \nRenal impairment \nCurrently available data on renal insufficiency are described in section 4.4, but no recommendation on \na posology can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of somatropin clearance has been noted. The \nclinical significance of this decrease is unknown. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nValtropin is administered by subcutaneous injection. \n \nThe injection sites should be varied in order to avoid lipo-atrophy. \n \nFor further information on reconstitution and administration see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (e.g. metacresol) (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n-  Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial \ntumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH \ntherapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n\n- Valtropin should not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n- Patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart or abdominal \n\nsurgery, multiple accidental trauma, or patients having acute respiratory failure. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2). \n \nPituitary \nThere is no evidence to suspect that growth hormone replacement influences the recurrence rate or \nregrowth of intracranial neoplasms, but standard clinical practice requires regular pituitary imaging in \npatients with a history of pituitary pathology. A baseline scan is recommended in these patients before \ninstituting growth hormone replacement therapy. \n \nTumour control \nIf the patient has had a brain tumour, the patient should be re-examined frequently to make sure that \nthe tumour has not come back. \nIn childhood cancer survivors, a higher risk of a second neoplasm (benign or malignant) has been \nreported in patients treated with somatropin. Intracranial tumours, in particular, were the most \ncommon of these second neoplasms. \n \nIntracranial hypertension \nIn cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision making in patients \nwith resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring \nfor symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n \nInsulin sensitivity \nBecause human growth hormone may induce a state of insulin resistance, patients treated with \nsomatropin should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. \n \nThyroid function \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 and may, as such, unmask \nincipient hypothyroidism. Monitoring of thyroid function should therefore be conducted in all patients. \nIn patients with hypopituitarism, standard replacement therapy must be closely monitored when \nsomatropin therapy is administered. \n \nSlipped capital epiphyse \nPatients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, may develop slipped capital \nepiphyses more frequently. Any child with the onset of a limp during growth hormone therapy should \nbe evaluated. \n \nGrowth hormone deficiency after epiphyseal closure \nSubjects who had been treated with growth hormone during childhood, until final height was attained, \nshould be re-evaluated for growth hormone deficiency after epiphyseal closure before replacement \ntherapy is commenced at the doses recommended for adults. \n \nTreatment after the end of growth in children \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nFor children, the treatment should be continued until the end of the growth has been reached. It is \nadvisable not to exceed the recommended dosage in view of the potential risks of acromegaly, \nhyperglycaemia, and glucosuria. \n \nPrader-Willi syndrome \nValtropin is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to Prader-Willi \nsyndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. There have been reports of \nsleep apnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi \nsyndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway \nobstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nBefore instituting treatment with somatropin for growth retardation secondary to chronic renal \ninsufficiency, children should have been followed for one year to verify growth disturbance. \nConservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of acidosis, \nhyperparathyroidism, and nutritional status for one year prior to the treatment) should have been \nestablished and should be maintained during treatment. Treatment with somatropin should be \ndiscontinued at the time of renal transplantation. \n \nGender and dosing \nIn order to reach the defined treatment goal, men may need lower growth hormone doses than women. \nOral oestrogen administration increases the dose requirements in women. An increasing sensitivity to \ngrowth hormone (expressed as change in IGF-1 per growth hormone dose) over time may be observed, \nparticularly in men. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every \n6 months. \n \nTurner syndrome \nPatients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders \nsince these patients have an increased risk of ear or hearing disorders. \n \nPancreatitis in children \nChildren treated with somatropin have an increased risk of developing pancreatitis compared to adults \ntreated with somatropin. Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated \nchildren who develop abdominal pain. \n \nAccidental intramuscular injection \nAfter accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may appear. Any unwanted reaction should \nbe followed. No special treatment is recommended. \n \n \nSensitivity to metacresol \nValtropin should not be reconstituted with the supplied solvent for patients with a known sensitivity to \nmetacresol. If sensitivity to the accompanying solvent occurs, the vials should be reconstituted with \nwater for injections and used as a single use vial (see section 6.3). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcessive glucocorticoid therapy will inhibit the growth-promoting effect of human growth hormone. \nPatients with co-existing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency should have their \nglucocorticoid replacement dose carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. \n \nIn women taking oral oestrogens, a higher dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the \ntreatment goal. \n \nPatients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with \nsomatropin. An adjustment of the insulin dose may be required. \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nData from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults, suggests that \nsomatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 \n(e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be especially increased \nresulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor Valtropin no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies are insufficient \nwith respect to effects on pregnancy, embryofoetal development, parturition or postnatal development \n(see section 5.3). Therefore Valtropin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere have been no clinical studies conducted with Valtropin in breast-feeding women. It is not \nknown whether somatropin is excreted in human milk. Therefore caution should be exercised when \nValtropin is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nNo data on fertility are available. Animal data showed no effect on fertility parameters. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nValtropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common frequent adverse reactions are associated with the injection site, of endocrine \nnature, and headache, paresthesia and joint pain and disorder (arthralgia) in adults. \n \nDuring clinical studies 128 children (98 children with growth hormone deficiency and 30 with Turner \nsyndrome) were exposed to Valtropin. The safety profile of Valtropin observed in these clinical \nstudies was consistent with that reported with the reference medicinal product used in these studies \nand other somatropin containing medicinal products. \n \nThe following adverse reactions and their frequencies have been observed under treatment with \nsomatropin based on published information: \n \nVery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata), including isolated reports \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and \nunspecified (including cysts and polyps) Uncommon: Neoplasm malignant, neoplasm \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon: Anaemia \nImmune system disorders Common: Antibody building \n\n \nNot known: Single case of acute hypersensitivity \ninvolving urticaria and pruritus \n\nEndocrine disorders Common: Hypothyroidism  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common: Glucose tolerance impaired \n Common: Mild hyperglycaemia (1% in children; \n\n6 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n1% - 10% in adults) \n Uncommon: Hypoglycaemia, hyperphosphatemia \n Rare: Diabetes mellitus \n Not known: Insulin resistance \nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: Personality disorder \nNervous system disorders Very common: Headache in adults \n Very common: Paresthesia in adults \n Common: Hypertonia \n Common: Insomnia in adults \n Common: Carpal tunnel syndrome in adults \n Uncommon: Carpal tunnel syndrome in children \n Uncommon: Nystagmus \n Rare: Neuropathy, intracranial pressure increased \n Rare: Benign intracranial hypertension \n Rare: Paresthesia in children \n Very rare: Insomnia in children \nEye disorders Uncommon: Papilloedema, diplopia \nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon: Vertigo \nCardiac disorders Common: Hypertension in adults \n Uncommon: Tachycardia \n Rare: Hypertension in children \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders Common: Dyspnoea in adults \n Common: Sleep apnoea in adults \nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon: Vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea\n Rare: Diarrhoea  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: Lipodystrophy, skin atrophy, exfoliative \ndermatitis, urticaria, hirsutism, skin hypertrophy \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders Very common: Arthralgia in adults \n Common: Arthralgia in children \n Common: Myalgia \n Uncommon: Muscle atrophy, bone pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Urinary incontinence, haematuria, polyuria, \nurine frequency/pollakiuria, urine abnormality \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders Uncommon: Genital discharge \n Uncommon: Gynaecomastia in adults \n Very rare: Gynaecomastia in children \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions  Very common: Oedema, peripheral oedema in adults \n Common: Oedema, peripheral oedema in children \n Common: Injection site reactions, asthenia \n\n \n\nUncommon: Injection site atrophy, injection site \nhaemorrhage, injection site mass, hypertrophy, weakness \nin children \n\nInvestigations Rare: Renal function test abnormal \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n\n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIn a clinical study with Valtropin, 3% of children with growth hormone deficiency developed \nantibodies to somatropin. The binding capacity of these antibodies was low and there was no effect on \ngrowth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in any patient who fails to \nrespond to therapy. \n \nAnti-host cell protein (anti-S. cerevisiae) antibodies were uncommon in patients treated with \nValtropin. The generation of such antibodies with low binding capacity is unlikely to be clinically \nrelevant. In contrast to bacteria (E. coli), yeast has not been described to elicit adjuvant effects \nmodifying the immunological response. \n \nPaediatric population \nMild and transient oedema was observed early during the course of treatment with somatropin.  \n \nAdult patients \nIn adult patients with adult-onset growth hormone deficiency, oedema, muscle pain, joint pain and \ndisorders were reported early in therapy and tended to be transient. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Long-term \noverdose could result in signs and symptoms of acromegaly consistent with the known effects of \nexcess human growth hormone. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for \nsomatropin overdose. It is recommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nsomatropin agonists; ATC code: H01AC01 \n \nSomatropin is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has 191 amino acid residues and \na molecular weight of 22,125 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the medicinal product is identical to \nthat of human growth hormone of pituitary origin. Valtropin is synthesised in yeast cells \n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nThe biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of human growth hormone of pituitary \norigin. \n \nThe most prominent effect of somatropin is that it stimulates the growth plates of long bones. \nAdditionally, it promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. \n \nSomatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol. \n \nSomatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in growth hormone-deficient patients, \nin that body fat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth \nhormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density. \n \nSomatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. \n \nClinical studies \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Valtropin has been assessed in a randomised, double-blind, parallel, \ncontrolled Phase III study in children with growth hormone deficiency. There were no relevant \n\n8 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\ndifferences between Valtropin and the reference medicinal product with regard to height velocity and \nheight velocity SDS. \n \nAn open single-arm Phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of treatment with Valtropin in \ngirls with short stature associated with Turner syndrome showed a significant effect of study treatment \non height velocity. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nA double-blind, randomised, single dose, crossover study in 24 healthy volunteers showed that the \npharmacokinetic profile of Valtropin was comparable to that of the reference medicinal product. \nSubcutaneous administration of 0.073 mg/kg body weight of Valtropin resulted in a Cmax of \n43.97 ng/ml and an AUC0-24 h of 369.90 ng\u00b7h/ml. Cmax was reached at 4 h and t\u00bd was 3 h. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies with Valtropin of \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies. \n \nAnimal studies with Valtropin are not sufficient to assess the reproductive toxicity potential. From \nreproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin medicinal products there is no evidence \nof an increased risk of adverse reactions for the embryo or foetus. \n \nLong-term studies for carcinogenicity have not been performed. There are no specific local tolerance \nstudies in animals after subcutaneous injection of Valtropin. However, in single and repeat-dose \ngeneral toxicity studies no adverse reactions at the injection sites were reported. \n \n \n6.

It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1. What Valtropin is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Valtropin \n3. How to use Valtropin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Valtropin \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT Valtropin IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nYour medicine is called Valtropin. It is a human growth hormone, also called somatropin. It has the \nsame structure as the growth hormone that the body produces in the pituitary glands (glands located at \nthe base of the brain). Growth hormone regulates the growth and development of cells. When it \nstimulates growth of cells in the long bones of the legs and spine, it causes an increase in height. \n \nValtropin is used \n- to treat children (2 to 11 years old) and teenagers (12 to 18 years old) who do not develop to \n\ntheir normal height because of poor bone growth caused by growth hormone deficiency (relative \nlack of growth hormone), Turner syndrome, or \u2018chronic renal insufficiency\u2019 (a condition in \nwhich the kidneys gradually lose their ability to perform their normal functions, such as the \nremoval of wastes and extra fluid from the body). \n\n- to treat adults with severe growth hormone deficiency who already had growth hormone \ndeficiency when they were children or who do not have enough growth hormone during their \nadult years for some other reason. \n\n \nIn this leaflet the patient is addressed as \u2018you\u2019. Caregivers administering Valtropin to their children \nshould consider that \u2018you\u2019 refers to the child. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE Valtropin \n \nDo not use Valtropin \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or any of the other ingredients of the \n\npowder or solvent of Valtropin, e.g. metacresol (see section 2, \u2018Take special care with \nValtropin \u2013 Occurrence of certain side effects\u2019) \n\n- and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour. Tumours must be inactive and you must \nhave finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Valtropin. \n\n- for growth promotion in children who have already stopped growing \n- if you have had a serious heart or abdominal operation \n- if you are being treated for more than one injury following a serious accident \n- if you have sudden serious breathing problems \n \n\n21 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nTake special care with Valtropin \nExaminations before starting treatment \n- A specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine you to decide if it is safe to use \n\nValtropin. \n- If you have had a brain tumour a specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine \n\nyour pituitary function to decide if it is safe to use Valtropin. \n- Before children are treated for growth hormone deficiency due to kidney problems, the doctor \n\nshould observe the child for one year before starting growth hormone treatment. \n- If adults have been treated with growth hormone during childhood, they should be re-evaluated \n\nfor growth hormone deficiency before starting any further treatment with growth hormones. \n- Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should not be treated with Valtropin unless they are also \n\nsuffering from growth hormone failure. \n \nDuring or after serious illness \n- If you have had a brain tumour, you should be re-examined frequently to make sure that the \n\ntumour has not come back. \n- If you had cancer as a child. A higher risk for having a second tumour (benign and malignant) \n\nhas been reported in patients that survived their cancer and were treated with somatropin. Of \nthese second tumours, in particular, brain tumours were the most common. \n\n- If children have had a kidney transplant, growth hormone treatment will be stopped. \n- If the child has Turner syndrome, the child\u2019s doctor should carefully check for ear infections \n\nsuch as otitis media, because Turner syndrome patients have an increased risk of ear or other \nhearing disorders. \n\n \nOccurrence of certain side effects \n- If symptoms like headache (severe and recurrent), visual changes, nausea and/or vomiting \n\noccur, please ask your doctor for advice. \n- If you have injected Valtropin by mistake into the muscle instead of under the skin, your blood \n\nsugar may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Please contact your doctor for further advice. \n- If the child begins to limp under treatment with Valtropin, please ask your doctor for advice. \n- If you are a child and you are treated with somatropin. You have an increased risk of developing \n\nan inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) compared to adults treated with somatropin. \nAlthough rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop \nabdominal pain. \n\n- Too much growth hormone can cause greater than normal growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and \ncheekbone (acromegaly), high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and presence of sugar in the urine \n(glucosuria). Always use Valtropin as recommended by your doctor. \n\n- If an allergic reaction to solvent occurs, the vials should be reconstituted with water for \ninjections without preservative (metacresol) and used as a single use vial (see section 5 \u2018How to \nstore Valtropin\u2019). Do not use the supplied solvent if you have a known allergy to metacresol \npreservative. \n\n \nMonitoring during treatment by your doctor \n- Valtropin may affect the way your body handles sugar from food and drink. Your doctor may \n\ncheck the amount of sugar in your urine or blood. \n- Valtropin can affect the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, so you must have thyroid \n\nfunction tests from time to time. If the thyroid is not working properly, Valtropin may not work \nas well as it should. \n\n \n\n22 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nTell especially your doctor if you are taking \n- adrenal steroid hormone such as cortisone or prednisolone \n- insulin \n- oral oestrogen  \n- sex hormones, medicines to treat stress response or inflammation (corticosteroids), medicines to \n\ntreat epilepsy (e.g. carbamazepin)or cyclosporine (a medicine to suppress the immune system). \n Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Valtropin or of the other medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nValtropin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you become pregnant, tell \nyour doctor immediately. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIf you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, please ask your doctor for advice before using \nValtropin. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicines. \n \nDriving and using machines \nValtropin has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Valtropin \nThe accompanying solvent of Valtropin contains metacresol. Do not use this solvent if you are allergic \nto metacresol (see section 2, \u2018Do not use Valtropin\u2019). If an allergic reaction to the solvent occurs, the \nvials should be reconstituted with water for injections and used as a single use vial (see section 5 \u2018How \nto store Valtropin\u2019). \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE Valtropin \n \nAlways use Valtropin exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Do not inject Valtropin yourself if you are not sure about the dose. \n \nDosage \nYour doctor will tell you how much to use. This will vary according to your disease. Please do not \nchange the dosage without consulting your doctor. \n \nThe accuracy of the Valtropin dose should be checked every 6 months by your doctor. \n \nIn general the dosage will be calculated as described below. However, individual doses may vary, and \nthe doctor may change your dose based on your specific need. \n \nChildren \n \nGrowth hormone deficiency in children \nInject 0.025 - 0.035 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin \n(subcutaneously). \n \nChildren with Turner syndrome \nInject 0.045 - 0.050 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin \n(subcutaneously). \n \n\n23 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nChildren before puberty, who suffer from long-term kidney problems \nInject 0.045 - 0.050 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin \n(subcutaneously). \n \nAdults \n \nGrowth hormone deficiency in adults \nInject 0.15 - 0.30 milligrams (mg) once daily under the skin (subcutaneously). A lower starting dose \nmay be necessary if you are older or overweight. \n \nIf necessary, your doctor will gradually increase this dose according to your individual requirements \nbased on the clinical outcome and measurement of your blood levels of a so called \u201cgrowth factor\u201d \n(known as IGF-1). The total daily dose usually does not exceed 1 mg. IGF-1 concentrations need to be \nregularly measured and should be maintained below the upper limit of the normal range for your age \nand sex. \n \nYour doctor will always prescribe the minimum effective dose to be used. \n \nDosage adjustment \nIn elderly patients a dose reduction may be necessary. \n \nThe dosage of somatropin should be reduced in cases of long lasting swelling (oedema) or severe \nabnormal sensation (paresthesia), in order to avoid the development of a rare side effect called carpal \ntunnel syndrome (hand numbness and pain). \n \nFollowing use of the medicine for some time, it may be necessary to reduce the dose, particularly in \nmen. \n \nWhen using other medicines the dose of Valtropin or of the other medicine may need to be adjusted \n(see section 2, \u2018Using other medicines\u2019). \n \nAdministration \nValtropin is intended for subcutaneous use after reconstitution. This means that after reconstitution of \nthe powder with the solvent provided the solution is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue \njust under the skin. \n \nIf you are injecting this medicine yourself you will be instructed how to prepare and give the injection. \n \nDo not inject Valtropin yourself unless you have received training. \n \nDetailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet (see section \n\u2018Information on how to self-inject Valtropin\u2019 at the end of this leaflet). \n \nIf you use more Valtropin than you should \nIn case more Valtropin was used than recommended, please consult your doctor. \n \nIf you have used too much Valtropin, initially your blood sugar may decrease and become too low \n(hypoglycaemia) and subsequently increase and become too high (hyperglycaemia). If you have used \ntoo much Valtropin over a longer period, this may result in a greater than normal growth of ears, nose, \nlips, tongue and cheekbone (acromegaly). \n \nIf you forget to use Valtropin \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten doses. Continue with the prescribed dosage \nregimen. If you have any doubts, please contact your doctor. \n \n\n24 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIf you stop using Valtropin \nPlease ask your doctor for advice before stopping treatment. Interruption or early stopping of \ntreatment with Valtropin may impair the success of the growth hormone therapy. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

has the same structure as the growth hormone that the body produces in the pituitary glands (glands located at the base of the brain). growth hormone regulates the growth and development of cells. when it stimulates growth of cells in the long bones of the legs and spine, it causes an increase in height. valtropin is used - to treat children (2 to 11 years old) and teenagers (12 to 18 years old) who do not develop to their normal height because of poor bone growth caused by growth hormone deficiency (relative lack of growth hormone), turner syndrome, or 'chronic renal insufficiency' (a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose their ability to perform their normal functions, such as the removal of wastes and extra fluid from the body). - to treat adults with severe growth hormone deficiency who already had growth hormone deficiency when they were children or who do not have enough growth hormone during their adult years for some other reason. in this leaflet the patient is addressed as 'you'. caregivers administering valtropin to their children should consider that 'you' refers to the child.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "valtropin", "Type":

serious heart or abdominal operation - if you are being treated for more than one injury following a serious accident - if you have sudden serious breathing problems 21 take special care with valtropin examinations before starting treatment - a specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine you to decide if it is safe to use valtropin. - if you have had a brain tumour a specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine your pituitary function to decide if it is safe to use valtropin. - before children are treated for growth hormone deficiency due to kidney problems, the doctor should observe the child for one year before starting growth hormone treatment. - if adults have been treated with growth hormone during childhood, they should be re-evaluated for growth hormone deficiency before starting any further treatment with growth hormones. - patients with prader-willi syndrome should not be treated with valtropin unless they are also suffering from growth hormone failure. during or after serious illness - if you have had a brain tumour, you should be re-examined frequently to make sure that the tumour has not come back. - if you had cancer as a child. a higher risk for having a second tumour (benign and malignant) has been reported in patients that survived their cancer and were treated with somatropin. of these second tumours, in particular, brain tumours were the most common. - if children have had a kidney transplant, growth hormone treatment will be stopped. - if the child has turner syndrome, the child's doctor should carefully check for ear infections such as otitis media, because turner syndrome patients have an increased risk of ear or other hearing disorders. occurrence of certain side effects - if symptoms like headache (severe and recurrent), visual changes, nausea and/or vomiting occur, please ask your doctor for advice. - if you have injected valtropin by mistake into the muscle instead of under the skin, your blood sugar may become too low (hypoglycaemia). please contact your doctor for further advice. - if the child begins to limp under treatment with valtropin, please ask your doctor for advice. - if you are a child and you are treated with somatropin. you have an increased risk of developing an inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) compared to adults treated with somatropin. although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop abdominal pain. - too much growth hormone can cause greater than normal growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (acromegaly), high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and presence of sugar in the urine (glucosuria). always use valtropin as recommended by your doctor. - if an allergic reaction to solvent occurs, the vials should be reconstituted with water for injections without preservative (metacresol) and used as a single use vial (see section 5 'how to store valtropin'). do not use the supplied solvent if you have a known allergy to metacresol preservative. monitoring during treatment by your doctor - valtropin may affect the way your body handles sugar from food and drink. your doctor may check the amount of sugar in your urine or blood. - valtropin can affect the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, so you must have thyroid function tests from time to time. if the thyroid is not working properly, valtropin may not work as well as it should. using other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. tell especially your doctor if you are taking - adrenal steroid hormone such as cortisone or prednisolone - insulin - oral oestrogen - sex hormones, medicines to treat stress response or inflammation (corticosteroids), medicines to treat epilepsy (e.g. carbamazepin)or cyclosporine (a medicine to suppress the immune system). your doctor may need to adjust the dose of valtropin or of the other medicine. pregnancy valtropin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. if you become pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. breast-feeding if you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, please ask your doctor for advice before using valtropin. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicines. driving and using machines valtropin has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines. important information about some of the ingredients of valtropin the accompanying solvent of

pharmacist if you are not sure. do not inject valtropin yourself if you are not sure about the dose. dosage your doctor will tell you how much to use. this will vary according to your disease. please do not change the dosage without consulting your doctor. the accuracy of the valtropin dose should be checked every 6 months by your doctor. in general the dosage will be calculated as described below. however, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may change your dose based on your specific need. children growth hormone deficiency in children inject 0.025 - 0.035 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin (subcutaneously). children with turner syndrome inject 0.045 - 0.050 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin (subcutaneously). children before puberty, who suffer from long-term kidney problems inject 0.045 - 0.050 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin (subcutaneously). adults growth hormone deficiency in adults inject 0.15 - 0.30 milligrams (mg) once daily under the skin (subcutaneously). a lower starting dose may be necessary if you are older or overweight. if necessary, your doctor will gradually increase this dose according to your individual requirements based on the clinical outcome and measurement of your blood levels of a so called \"growth factor\" (known as igf-1). the total daily dose usually does not exceed 1 mg. igf-1 concentrations need to be regularly measured and should be maintained below the upper limit of the normal range for your age and sex. your doctor will always prescribe the minimum effective dose to be used. dosage adjustment in elderly patients a dose reduction may be necessary. the dosage of somatropin should be reduced in cases of long lasting swelling (oedema) or severe abnormal sensation (paresthesia), in order to avoid the development of a rare side effect called carpal tunnel syndrome (hand numbness and pain). following use of the medicine for some time, it may be necessary to reduce the dose, particularly in men. when using other medicines the dose of valtropin or of the other medicine may need to be adjusted (see section 2, 'using other medicines'). administration valtropin is intended for subcutaneous use after reconstitution. this means that after reconstitution of the powder with the solvent provided the solution is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. if you are injecting this medicine yourself you will be instructed how to prepare and give the injection. do not inject valtropin yourself unless you have received training. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet (see section 'information on how to self-inject valtropin' at the end of this leaflet). if you use more valtropin than you should in case more valtropin was used than recommended, please consult your doctor. if you have used too much valtropin, initially your blood sugar may decrease and become too low (hypoglycaemia) and subsequently increase and become too high (hyperglycaemia). if you have used too much valtropin over a longer period, this may result in a greater than normal growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (acromegaly). if you forget to use valtropin do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten doses. continue with the prescribed dosage regimen. if you have any doubts, please contact your doctor. if you stop using valtropin please ask your doctor for advice before stopping treatment. interruption or early stopping of treatment with valtropin may impair the success of the growth hormone therapy. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.",
