NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nStribild 150 mg/150 mg/200 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine \nand 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (equivalent to 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 136 mg \nof tenofovir). \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 10.4 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nGreen, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 20 mm x 10 mm, debossed on one side with \n\u201cGSI\u201d and the number \u201c1\u201d surrounded by a square box on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nStribild is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults \naged 18 years and over who are antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve or are infected with HIV-1 without \nknown mutations associated with resistance to any of the three antiretroviral agents in Stribild (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nStribild is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years \nweighing \u2265 35 kg who are infected with HIV-1 without known mutations associated with resistance to \nany of the three antiretroviral agents in Stribild and who have experienced toxicities which preclude \nthe use of other regimens that do not contain tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg: One tablet, once daily with \nfood. \n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Stribild within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Stribild with food as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses \na dose of Stribild by more than 18 hours and it is almost time for the next dose, the patient should not \ntake the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Stribild another tablet should be taken. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  Stribild should be administered with caution to elderly patients (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nAdults with renal impairment \nStribild should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2).  See section 4.4 regarding initiation of Stribild in patients with creatinine clearance below \n90 mL/min. \n \nStribild should be discontinued if creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL/min during treatment \nwith Stribild as dose interval adjustment is required for emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil and this \ncannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  See section 4.4 \nregarding patients with creatinine clearance that falls below 70 mL/min while on treatment with \nStribild. \n \nPaediatric patients with renal impairment \nUse of Stribild is not recommended in paediatric patients under the age of 18 years with renal \nimpairment (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Stribild is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.  Stribild has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  Therefore, Stribild is not recommended for use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIf Stribild is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), these patients \nshould be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Stribild in children under the age of 12 years or weighing < 35 kg have not \nbeen established (see section 5.2).  \n \nPregnancy \nTreatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir during pregnancy results in lower elvitegravir exposure (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).  Therefore, therapy with Stribild should not be initiated during pregnancy, and \nwomen who become pregnant during therapy with Stribild should be switched to an alternative regimen \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nStribild should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should \nnot be chewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPatients who have previously discontinued treatment with tenofovir disoproxil due to renal toxicity, \nwith or without reversal of the effects post-discontinuation. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nCo-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for \nclearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or \nlife-threatening events.  Therefore, Stribild should not be co-administered with medicinal products that \ninclude, but are not limited to, the following (see section 4.5): \n \n\u2022 alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists: alfuzosin \n\u2022 antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine \n\u2022 ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine \n\u2022 gastrointestinal motility agents: cisapride \n\u2022 HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin \n\u2022 neuroleptics/antipsychotics: pimozide, lurasidone \n\u2022 PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension \n\u2022 sedatives/hypnotics: orally administered midazolam, triazolam \n \nCo-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A due \nto the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Stribild.  Therefore, Stribild \nshould not be co-administered with medicinal products that include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing (see section 4.5): \n \n\u2022 anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n\u2022 antimycobacterials: rifampicin \n\u2022 herbal products: St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \nCo-administration with dabigatran etexilate, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adults \n \nRenal effects \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, \nhypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with \nthe use of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.8). \n \nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat. \n \nPatients who have previously discontinued treatment with tenofovir disoproxil due to renal toxicity, \nwith or without reversal of the effects post-discontinuation, should not be treated with Stribild (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal monitoring \nBefore initiating treatment with Stribild \nCreatinine clearance should be calculated and urine glucose and urine protein should be determined in \nall patients.  Stribild should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance < 70 mL/min.  It is \nrecommended that Stribild is not initiated in patients with creatinine clearance < 90 mL/min unless, \nafter review of the available treatment options, it is considered that Stribild is the preferred treatment \nfor the individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nDuring treatment with Stribild \nCreatinine clearance, serum phosphate, urine glucose and urine protein should be monitored every \nfour weeks during the first year and then every three months during Stribild therapy.  In patients at risk \nfor renal impairment a more frequent monitoring of renal function is required. \n \nCobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in serum \ncreatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance (see section 4.8).  Patients who experience a \nconfirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 26.5 \u00b5mol/L (0.3 mg/dL) from baseline should \nbe closely monitored for renal safety. \n \nSee also under Co-administration of other medicinal products below. \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is < 0.48 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 70 mL/min, \nrenal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, \nblood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8).  It is recommended that Stribild is \ndiscontinued in patients with creatinine clearance that falls to < 70 mL/min while on treatment unless \nit is considered that the potential benefit of this combination of antiretroviral agents for the individual \npatient outweighs the possible risks of continuing with therapy.  Interrupting treatment with Stribild \nshould also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has \nbeen identified. \n \nStribild should be discontinued in patients with confirmed creatinine clearance that falls \nto < 50 mL/min (since the required dose interval adjustments are not possible using this fixed dose \ncombination tablet) or with decreases in serum phosphate to < 0.32 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nBone effects \nIn the Phase 3 Study GS-US-236-0103, bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed in a non-random \nsubset of 120 subjects (Stribild group n = 54; ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) plus emtricitabine \n(FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil group n = 66).  Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to \nWeek 144 in the Stribild group were comparable to the ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil group at the \nlumbar spine (-1.43% versus -3.68%, respectively) and at the hip (-2.83% versus -3.77%, \nrespectively).  In the Phase 3 studies GS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103, bone fractures occurred \nin 27 subjects (3.9%) in the Stribild group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the EFV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup, and 19 subjects (5.4%) in the ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil group. \n \nIn a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil with stavudine in \ncombination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, small decreases in BMD of \nthe hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in \nbone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at \n144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  \nHowever, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone \nabnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8).  If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation \nshould be obtained. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nRenal and bone effects in the paediatric population \n \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long-term effects of tenofovir disoproxil bone and renal \ntoxicity.  Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a \nmultidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the \nbenefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment (including \ndecision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for supplementation. \n \nRenal effects  \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV-1 \ninfected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in a clinical study of tenofovir disoproxil \n(GS-US-104-0352) (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nRenal function (creatinine clearance and urine glucose and urine protein) should be evaluated prior to \ntreatment initiation, and creatinine clearance, serum phosphate, urine glucose and urine protein should \nbe monitored during treatment as in HIV-1 infected adults (see above). \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 0.96 mmol/L (3.0 mg/dL)  in any paediatric patient receiving \nStribild, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood \nglucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  If \nrenal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained \nto consider interruption of treatment.  Interrupting treatment with Stribild should also be considered in \ncase of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified.  As in adults, \nadolescents who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 26.5 \u00b5mol/L \n(0.3 mg/dL) from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety (see above). \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nThe same recommendations apply as in adults (see Co-administration of other medicinal products \nbelow). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of Stribild is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2).   \nStribild should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued \nin paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during Stribild therapy. \n \nBone effects \nTenofovir disoproxil may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated \nchanges in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nIn a clinical study of HIV-1-infected, treatment-na\u00efve patients aged 12 to < 18 years (N=50), small \ndecreases in mean BMD Z-scores were observed following treatment with Stribild (see section 4.8). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \nPatients with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus co-infection \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nPhysicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines for the optimal management of \nHIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nIn case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary \nof Product Characteristics for these medicinal products.  Stribild should not be administered \nconcomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir \ndipivoxil used for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection. \n \nDiscontinuation of Stribild therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with \nsevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue \nStribild should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several \nmonths after stopping treatment.  If appropriate, initiation of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.  In \npatients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since \npost-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Stribild have not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.  The pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, cobicistat and tenofovir have been studied in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment.  Stribild has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  No dose adjustment of Stribild is required in patients with \nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown aetiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\njirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients receiving Stribild or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nStribild is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and must not \nbe administered with other antiretroviral products (see section 4.5). \n \nStribild should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection, or \nwith other medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nConcomitant use with nephrotoxic medicinal products \nUse of Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product, \ne.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or \ninterleukin 2 (also called aldesleukin) (see section 4.5).  If concomitant use of Stribild and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function must be monitored weekly. \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be \nmonitored adequately. \n \nContraception requirements \nFemale patients of childbearing potential should use either a hormonal contraceptive containing at \nleast 30 \u00b5g ethinyloestradiol and containing drospirenone or norgestimate as the progestogen or should \nuse an alternative reliable method of contraception (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  The use of Stribild with \noral contraceptives containing other progestogens should be avoided (see section 4.5).  Plasma \nconcentrations of drospirenone are expected to be increased following co-administration with Stribild \nand clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalaemia (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with Stribild should be considered, particularly in patients at \nincreased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving Stribild concomitantly with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir should be \nmonitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nElderly \n \nStribild has limited data in patients over the age of 65 years.  Elderly patients are more likely to have \ndecreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients with \nStribild. \n \nPregnancy \n \nTreatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has \nbeen shown to result in lower elvitegravir exposures (see section 5.2).  Cobicistat levels decrease and \nmay not provide sufficient boosting.  The substantial reduction in elvitegravir exposure may result in \nvirological failure and an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Therefore, \ntherapy with Stribild should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant \nduring therapy with Stribild should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \n \nExcipients \n \nStribild contains lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Stribild contains elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions \nthat have been identified with these active substances individually may occur with Stribild.  Stribild is \nindicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and must not be \nadministered with other antiretroviral products.  Therefore, information regarding drug-drug \ninteractions with other antiretroviral products (including protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors) is not provided (see section 4.4).  Interaction studies have only been \nperformed in adults. \n \nCobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate.  Cobicistat is also a \nweak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6.  The transporters that \ncobicistat inhibits include P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. \n \nCo-administration of Stribild with medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A or \nCYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of those products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse \nreactions (see Concomitant use contraindicated and section 4.3).  Co-administration of Stribild with \nmedicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma \nconcentrations of these active metabolite(s). \n \nCo-administration of Stribild with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance \nof cobicistat, resulting in increased cobicistat plasma concentrations. \n \nElvitegravir is a modest inducer and may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 and/or inducible UGT \nenzymes; as such it may decrease the plasma concentration of substrates of these enzymes.  \nElvitegravir is metabolised by CYP3A and, to a minor extent, by UGT1A1.  Medicinal products that \ninduce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir, resulting in decreased \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nplasma concentration of elvitegravir which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Stribild and \ndevelopment of resistance (see Concomitant use contraindicated and section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \n \nCo-administration of Stribild and some medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A \nmay result in increased plasma concentrations of these products, which are associated with the \npotential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia (e.g., \ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergometrine), or myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (e.g., \nsimvastatin, lovastatin), or prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression (e.g., orally \nadministered midazolam or triazolam).  Co-administration of Stribild and other medicinal products \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A such as amiodarone, quinidine, cisapride, pimozide, lurasidone, \nalfuzosin and sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of Stribild and some medicinal products that induce CYP3A such as St. John\u2019s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin may result in \nsignificantly decreased cobicistat and elvitegravir plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of \ntherapeutic effect and development of resistance (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of \nStribild with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. \ncidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered \nmedicinal products. \n \nUse of Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products.  \nSome examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, \nganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (also called aldesleukin). \n \nOther interactions \n \nInteractions between the components of Stribild and potential co-administered medicinal products are \nlisted in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d).  The \ninteractions described are based on studies conducted with the components of Stribild as individual \nagents and/or in combination, or are potential drug interactions that may occur with Stribild. \n \nTable 1: Interactions between the individual components of Stribild and other medicinal \nproducts \n \n\nMedicinal product by therapeutic \nareas \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, \n\nCmin1 \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with Stribild \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntifungals \nKetoconazole (200 mg twice \ndaily)/Elvitegravir (150 mg once \ndaily)2 \n\nElvitegravir: \nAUC: \u2191 48% \nCmin: \u2191 67% \nCmax: \u2194 \n \nConcentrations of ketoconazole and/or \ncobicistat may increase with \nco-administration of Stribild. \n\nWhen administering with Stribild, \nthe maximum daily dose of \nketoconazole should not exceed \n200 mg per day.

However, a large amount of data in pregnant women (more than1,000 pregnancy \noutcomes) indicate no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine and \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \nTreatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has \nbeen shown to result in lower elvitegravir exposure (see section 5.2).  Cobicistat levels decrease and \nmay not provide sufficient boosting.  The substantial reduction in elvitegravir exposure may result in \nvirological failure and an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Therefore, \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\ntherapy with Stribild should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant \nduring therapy with Stribild should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether elvitegravir or cobicistat are excreted in human milk.  Emtricitabine and \ntenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk.  In animal studies it has been shown that \nelvitegravir, cobicistat and tenofovir are excreted in milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in newborns/infants.  \nTherefore Stribild should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Stribild on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nStribild has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  However, patients \nshould be informed that dizziness, fatigue and insomnia have been reported during treatment with \nStribild. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to Stribild in \nclinical studies through 144 weeks in treatment-na\u00efve adult patients were nausea (16%) and diarrhoea \n(12%). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions to Stribild in clinical studies through 48 weeks in \nvirologically-suppressed adult patients were nausea (3% to 5%) and fatigue (6%). \n \nIn patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, renal failure and \nuncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) sometimes leading to \nbone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  Monitoring of renal \nfunction is recommended for patients receiving Stribild (see section 4.4). \n \nDiscontinuation of Stribild therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with \nsevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions to Stribild from Phase 3 clinical studies GS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103 and \nadverse reactions to treatment with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil from clinical studies and \npost-marketing experience, when used with other antiretrovirals, are listed in Table 2, below, by body \nsystem organ class and highest frequency observed.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common \n(\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with Stribild based on experience \nfrom Phase 3 studies GS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103 and adverse reactions to treatment \nwith emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil from clinical studies and post-marketing experience, \nwhen used with other antiretrovirals \n \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \nCommon: neutropenia1 \nUncommon: anaemia1,2 \nImmune system disorders: \nCommon: allergic reaction1 \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common: hypophosphataemia1,3 \nCommon: hyperglycaemia1, hypertriglyceridaemia1, decreased appetite \nUncommon: hypokalaemia1,3 \nRare: lactic acidosis1 \nPsychiatric disorders: \nCommon: insomnia, abnormal dreams \n\nUncommon: suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness), depression \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: headache, dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n\nCommon: \nelevated amylase including elevated pancreatic amylase1, elevated serum \nlipase1, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, abdominal distension1, \nflatulence \n\nUncommon: pancreatitis1 \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon: increased transaminases1, hyperbilirubinaemia1 \nRare: hepatic steatosis1, hepatitis1 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common: rash \n\nCommon: vesiculobullous rash\n1, pustular rash1, maculopapular rash1, pruritus1, \n\nurticaria1, skin discolouration (increased pigmentation)1,2 \nUncommon: angioedema1 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nVery common: elevated creatine kinase1 \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis1,3, muscular weakness1,3 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)1,3,5, myopathy1,3 \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nCommon: increased blood creatinine4 \n\nUncommon: renal failure\n4, proximal renal tubulopathy including Fanconi syndrome \n\nacquired4, proteinuria \n\nRare: acute tubular necrosis\n1, nephritis (including acute interstitial nephritis)1,5, \n\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus1 \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: asthenia1 \nCommon: pain1, fatigue \n\n1 This adverse reaction was not observed in the Phase 3 clinical studies for Stribild but identified from clinical studies or \npost-marketing experience for emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil when used with other antiretrovirals. \n\n2 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was \nadministered to paediatric patients. \n\n3 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n\n4 See section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n5 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil but not \n\nobserved in randomised, controlled clinical studies in adults or paediatric HIV clinical studies for emtricitabine or in \nrandomised controlled clinical studies or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program for tenofovir disoproxil.  The \nfrequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to \nemtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical studies (n = 1,563) or tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled \nclinical studies and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nRenal impairment \nProximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  \nHowever, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with \nbaseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic \nmedications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the clinical studies of Stribild over 144 weeks, 13 (1.9%) subjects in the Stribild group (n = 701) \nand 8 (2.3%) subjects in the ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil group (n = 355) discontinued study drug \ndue to a renal adverse reaction.  Of these discontinuations, 7 in the Stribild group and 1 in the \nATV/r+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil group occurred during the first 48 weeks.  The types of renal adverse \nreactions seen with Stribild were consistent with previous experience with tenofovir disoproxil.  Four \n(0.6%) of the subjects who received Stribild developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal \ntubulopathy leading to discontinuation of Stribild during the first 48 weeks.  No additional proximal \nrenal tubular dysfunction cases were reported from Week 48 to Week 144.  Two of the four subjects \nhad renal impairment (i.e. estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min) at baseline.  The \nlaboratory findings in these 4 subjects with evidence of proximal tubulopathy improved without \nclinical consequence upon discontinuation of Stribild, but did not completely resolve in all subjects.  \nThree (0.8%) subjects who received ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil developed laboratory findings \nconsistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction leading to discontinuation of ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir \ndisoproxil after Week 96 (see section 4.4). \n \nThe cobicistat component of Stribild has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to \ninhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function.  In studies \nGS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in \ntreatment with Stribild, after which they stabilised.  The mean change in estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 144 weeks of treatment \nwas -14.0 \u00b1 16.6 mL/min for Stribild, -1.9 \u00b1 17.9 mL/min for EFV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil, \nand -9.8 \u00b1 19.4 mL/min for ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nLactic acidosis \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nStudies with Stribild \nThe safety of Stribild in 50 HIV-1-infected, treatment-na\u00efve paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years \nwas evaluated through 48 weeks in an open-label clinical study (GS-US-236-0112, see section 5.1).  In \nthis study, the safety profile of Stribild was similar to that in adults (see section 4.8, Tabulated \nsummary of adverse reactions).  Among the 50 paediatric patients receiving Stribild, mean BMD \nincreased from baseline to Week 48, +0.68% for lumbar spine and +0.77% for total body less head.  \nMean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores (height-age adjusted) were \u22120.09 for lumbar spine and \n\u22120.12 for total body less head at Week 48. \n \nStudies with emtricitabine \nAssessment of adverse reactions related to emtricitabine is based on experience in three paediatric \nstudies (n = 169) where treatment-na\u00efve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced (n = 46) paediatric HIV \ninfected patients aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in combination with other \nantiretroviral agents.  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin \ndiscolouration (31.8%) occurred more frequently in clinical trials in paediatric patients than in adults \n(see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse reactions). \n  \nStudies with tenofovir disoproxil  \nAssessment of adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil is based on two randomised trials \n(studies GS-US-104-0321 and GS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged \n2 to < 18 years) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active \ncomparator (n = 91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1).  \nThe adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil \nwere consistent with those observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected adolescents (aged \n12 to < 18 years), the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were \nlower than those observed in subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 infected children (aged \n2 to 15 years), the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir disoproxil were \nlower than those observed in subjects who remained on their stavudine- or zidovudine-containing \nregimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 89 paediatric patients with a median age of 7 years (range 2 to 15 years) \nwere exposed to tenofovir disoproxil for a median of 331 weeks.  Eight of the 89 patients (9.0%) \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy.  Seven patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Among them, 3 patients experienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated \nGFR during therapy which improved after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nInsufficient safety data are available for children below 12 years of age.  Stribild is not recommended \nin this population (see section 4.2). \n \nOther special population(s) \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nSince tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended \nin any adult with renal impairment treated with Stribild (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).  The use of \nStribild is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HIV infected patients co-infected with HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis have \noccurred after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Stribild.  As elvitegravir and cobicistat are highly \nbound to plasma proteins it is unlikely that elvitegravir and cobicistat will be significantly removed by \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of \nthe tenofovir dose can be removed by haemodialysis.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or \ntenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations.  ATC code: J05AR09 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nElvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  Integrase is an HIV-1 encoded \nenzyme that is required for viral replication.  Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of \nHIV-1 DNA into host genomic DNA, blocking the formation of the HIV-1 provirus and propagation \nof the viral infection. \n \nCobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily.  \nInhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A \nsubstrates, such as elvitegravir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is shortened by \nCYP3A-dependent metabolism. \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine.  Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to \ntenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate.  Both \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nemtricitabine and tenofovir have activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and \nHIV-2) and hepatitis B virus. \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate, respectively.  In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and \ntenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells.  Emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain \ntermination. \n \nBoth emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA \npolymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe dual-drug combinations and the triple combination of elvitegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndemonstrated synergistic activity in cell culture.  Antiviral synergy was maintained for elvitegravir, \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir when tested in the presence of cobicistat.  No antagonism was observed \nfor any of these combinations. \n \nThe antiviral activity of elvitegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cells, monocyte/macrophage cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes and the 50% \neffective concentration (EC50) values were in the range of 0.02 to 1.7 nM.  Elvitegravir displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged \nfrom 0.1 to 1.3 nM) and activity against HIV-2 (EC50 of 0.53 nM). \n \nCobicistat has no detectable anti-HIV activity and does not antagonise or enhance the antiviral effects \nof elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir. \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  The \nEC50 values for emtricitabine were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 \u00b5M.  Emtricitabine displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from \n0.007 to 0.075 \u00b5M) and showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 \nto 1.5 \u00b5M). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.  \nThe EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 to 8.5 \u00b5M.  Tenofovir displayed antiviral \nactivity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.5 \nto 2.2 \u00b5M) and strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 1.6 to 5.5 \u00b5M). \n \nResistance \n \nIn cell culture \nResistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir has been seen in vitro and in the HIV-1 from some patients \ndue to the development of the M184V or M184I emtricitabine resistance substitution in reverse \ntranscriptase or the K65R tenofovir resistance substitution in reverse transcriptase.  In addition, a \nK70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been selected clinically by tenofovir disoproxil \nand results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and lamivudine. \n \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine.  The K65R substitution can \nalso be selected by abacavir, stavudine or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these \nagents plus lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir.  Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in \npatients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R substitution. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nIn patients, HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that \nincluded either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced susceptibility to \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir have been selected in cell culture.  Reduced \nsusceptibility to elvitegravir was most commonly associated with the integrase substitutions T66I, \nE92Q and Q148R.  Additional integrase substitutions observed in cell culture selection included \nH51Y, F121Y, S147G, S153Y, E157Q, and R263K.  HIV-1 with the raltegravir-selected substitutions \nT66A/K, Q148H/K, and N155H showed cross-resistance to elvitegravir.  Primary mutations for \nraltegravir/elvitegravir do not affect the in vitro susceptibility of dolutegravir as single mutations, and \nthe additional presence of secondary mutations (except Q148) also does not result in relevant fold \nchanges in experiments with site directed mutants. \n \nNo development of resistance to cobicistat can be demonstrated in HIV-1 in vitro due to its lack of \nantiviral activity. \n \nSubstantial cross-resistance was observed between most elvitegravir-resistant HIV-1 isolates and \nraltegravir, and between emtricitabine-resistant isolates and lamivudine.  Patients who failed treatment \nwith Stribild and who had HIV-1 with emergent Stribild resistance substitutions harboured virus that \nremained susceptible to all PIs, NNRTIs, and most other NRTIs. \n \nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients \nIn a pooled analysis of antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients receiving Stribild in Phase 3 studies \nGS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103 through Week 144, genotyping was performed on plasma \nHIV-1 isolates from all patients with confirmed virologic failure or who had HIV-1 RNA \n> 400 copies/mL at virologic failure, at Week 48, at Week 96, at Week 144 or at the time of early \nstudy drug discontinuation.  As of Week 144, the development of one or more primary elvitegravir, \nemtricitabine, or tenofovir resistance-associated substitutions was observed in 18 of the 42 patients \nwith evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and Stribild treatment-failure isolates (2.6%, \n18/701 patients).  Of the 18 patients with viral resistance development, 13 occurred through Week 48, \n3 occurred between Week 48 to Week 96, and 2 occurred between Week 96 to Week 144 of treatment.  \nThe substitutions that emerged were M184V/I (n = 17) and K65R (n = 5) in reverse transcriptase and \nE92Q (n = 9), N155H (n = 5), Q148R (n = 3), T66I (n = 2), and T97A (n = 1) in integrase.  Other \nsubstitutions in integrase that occurred in addition to a primary INSTI resistance substitution each in \nsingle cases were H51Y, L68V, G140C, S153A, E157Q, and G163R.  Most patients who developed \nresistance substitutions to elvitegravir developed resistance substitutions to both emtricitabine and \nelvitegravir.  In phenotypic analyses of isolates from patients in the resistance analysis population, \n13 patients (31%) had HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir, 17 patients (40%) had \nreduced susceptibility to emtricitabine, and 2 patients (5%) had reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nIn Study GS-US-236-0103, 27 patients treated with Stribild had HIV-1 with the NNRTI-associated \nK103N substitution in reverse transcriptase at baseline and had virologic success (82% at Week 144) \nsimilar to the overall population (78%), and no emergent resistance to elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or \ntenofovir in their HIV-1. \n \nIn virologically-suppressed patients \nNo emergent resistance to Stribild was identified in clinical studies of virologically-suppressed \npatients who switched from a regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI+RTV) \n(Study GS-US-236-0115), an NNRTI (Study GS-US-236-0121) or raltegravir (RAL) (Study \nGS-US-236-0123). \n \nTwenty patients from these studies who switched to Stribild had the NNRTI-associated K103N \nsubstitution in their historical genotype prior to starting initial antiretroviral therapy.  Eighteen of these \n20 patients maintained virologic suppression through 48 weeks.  Due to protocol violation, two \npatients with historical K103N substitutions discontinued early with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nClinical experience \n \nThe efficacy of Stribild in HIV-1 infected treatment-na\u00efve adult patients is based on the analyses of \n144-week data from 2 randomised, double-blinded, active-controlled, Phase 3 studies, \nGS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103 (n = 1,408).  The efficacy of Stribild in HIV-1 infected \nvirologically-suppressed adult patients is based on the analyses of 48-week data from two randomised, \nopen-label studies (Studies GS-US-236-0115 and GS-US-236-0121) and a single group open-label \nstudy (Study GS-US-236-0123) (n = 910; 628 receiving Stribild). \n \nTreatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients \nIn Study GS-US-236-0102 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve adult patients received once-\ndaily treatment of Stribild or once-daily treatment of fixed-dose combination of EFV/FTC/tenofovir \ndisoproxil.  In Study GS-US-236-0103 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve adult patients \nreceived once daily treatment of Stribild or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) plus fixed-dose \ncombination of emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil.  For both studies at 48 weeks, the virologic \nresponse rate was evaluated in both treatment arms.  Virologic response was defined as achieving an \nundetectable viral load (< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, snapshot analysis). \n \nBaseline characteristics and treatment outcomes for both Studies GS-US-236-0102 and \nGS-US-236-0103 are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. \n \nTable 3: Demographic and baseline characteristics of antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 \ninfected adult subjects in studies GS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103 \n \n\n Study GS-US-236-0102 Study GS-US-236-0103 \n Stribild \n\n \nn = 348 \n\nEFV/FTC/ \ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nn = 352 \n\nStribild \n \n\nn = 353 \n\nATV/r + FTC/ \ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nn = 355 \nDemographic characteristics \n\nMean age, years (range) 38.0 \n(18-67) \n\n38.0 \n(19-72) \n\nSex   \n Male 89% 90% \n Female 11% 10% \nEthnicity   \n White 63% 74% \n Black/African American 28% 17% \n Asian 2% 5% \n Other 7% 4% \n\nBaseline disease characteristicsa \nMean baseline plasma \nHIV-1 RNA (range) \nlog10 copies/mL \n\n4.8 \n(2.6-6.5) \n\n4.8 \n(1.7-6.6) \n\nPercentage of subjects with \nviral load \n> 100,000 copies/mL \n\n33 40 \n\nMean baseline CD4+ cell \ncount (range), x 106 cells/L \n\n386 \n(3-1,348) \n\n370 \n(5-1,132) \n\nPercentage of subjects with \nCD4+ cell counts \n\u2264 200 cells/mm3 \n\n13 13 \n\na Patients were stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA in both studies. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nTable 4: Virologic outcome of randomised treatment of studies GS-US-236-0102 and \nGS-US-236-0103 at Week 48 (snapshot analysis)a and Week 144b \n \n\n Week 48 Week 144 \n Study \n\nGS-US-236-0102 \nStudy \n\nGS-US-236-0103 \nStudy \n\nGS-US-236-0102 \nStudy \n\nGS-US-236-0103 \n  \n\nStribild \nn = 348 \n\nEFV/ \nFTC/ \n\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nn = 352 \n\n \nStribild \nn = 353 \n\nATV/r + \nFTC/ \n\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nn = 355 \n\n \nStribild \nn = 348 \n\nEFV/ \nFTC/ \n\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \nn = 352 \n\n \nStribild \nn = 353 \n\nATV/r + \nFTC/ \n\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nn = 355 \nVirologic success \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL \n\n88% 84% 90% 87% 80% 75% 78% 75% \n\nTreatment \ndifference \n\n3.6% (95% CI \n= -1.6%, 8.8%) \n\n3.0% (95% CI \n= -1.9%, 7.8%) \n\n4.9% (95% CI \n= -1.3%, 11.1%) \n\n3.1% (95% CI \n= -3.2%, 9.4%) \n\nVirologic failurec 7% 7% 5% 5% 7% 10% 8% 7% \nNo virologic data \nat Week 48 or \n144 window \n\n        \n\nDiscontinued \nstudy drug due \nto AE or deathd \n\n3% 5% 3% 5% 6% 8% 6% 8% \n\nDiscontinued \nstudy drug due \nto other reasons \nand last \navailable \nHIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mLe \n\n2% 3% 2% 3% 5% 7% 8% 9% \n\nMissing data \nduring window \nbut on study drug \n\n0% 0% 0% 0% 1% 0% 1% 1% \n\na Week 48 window is between Day 309 and 378 (inclusive). \nb Week 144 window is between Day 967 and 1,050 (inclusive). \nc Includes subjects who had \u2265 50 copies/mL in the Week 48 or Week 144 window, subjects who discontinued early due to \n\nlack or loss of efficacy, subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or lack or loss of \nefficacy and at the time of discontinuation had a viral value of \u2265 50 copies/mL. \n\nd Includes patients who discontinued due to adverse event or death at any time point from day 1 through the time window \nif this resulted in no virologic data on treatment during the specified window. \n\ne Includes subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or lack or loss of efficacy, e.g., \nwithdrew consent, loss to follow-up, etc. \n\n \nStribild met the non-inferiority criteria in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to \nefavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and when compared to atazanavir/ritonavir + \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nIn Study GS-US-236-0102, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was \n239 cells/mm3 in the Stribild-treated patients and 206 cells/mm3 in the EFV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil-\ntreated patients.  At Week 144, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 321 cells/mm3 \nin the Stribild-treated patients and 300 cells/mm3 in the EFV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil-treated \npatients.  In Study GS-US-236-0103, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 \nwas 207 cells/mm3 in the Stribild-treated patients and 211 cells/mm3 in the ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated patients.  At Week 144, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was \n280 cells/mm3 in the Stribild-treated patients and 293 cells/mm3 in the ATV/r+FTC/tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated patients. \n \nVirologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected patients \nIn Study GS-US-236-0115 and Study GS-US-236-0121, patients had to be on either their first or \nsecond antiretroviral regimen with no history of virologic failure, have no current or past history of \nresistance to the antiretroviral components of Stribild and must have been suppressed on a PI+RTV or \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nan NNRTI in combination with FTC/tenofovir disoproxil (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least six \nmonths prior to screening.  Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either switch to Stribild or stay \non their baseline antiretroviral regimen (SBR) for 48 weeks.  In Study GS-US-236-0115, virologic \nsuccess rates were: Stribild 93.8% (272 of 290 patients); SBR 87.1% (121 of 139 patients).  The mean \nincrease from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 40 cells/mm3 in the Stribild-treated patients \nand 32 cells/mm3 in the PI+RTV+FTC/tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients.  In Study \nGS-US-236-0121, virologic success rates were: Stribild 93.4% (271 of 290 patients) and SBR 88.1% \n(126 of 143 patients).  The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was \n56 cells/mm3 in the Stribild-treated patients and 58 cells/mm3 in the NNRTI+FTC/tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated patients. \n \nIn Study GS-US-236-0123, patients had to have previously only received RAL in combination with \nFTC/tenofovir disoproxil as their first antiretroviral regimen for at least six months.  Patients had to be \nstably suppressed for at least six months prior to study entry, have no current or past history of \nresistance to the antiretroviral components of Stribild, and have HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at \nscreening.  All 48 patients who received at least one dose of Stribild remained suppressed \n(HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) through Week 48.  The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count \nat Week 48 was 23 cells/mm3. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nStudies with Stribild \nThe efficacy and safety of Stribild  in HIV-1-infected, treatment-na\u00efve paediatric patients aged 12 to \nless than 18 years is based on the analyses of 48-week data from the single-group, open-label study \nGS-US-236-0112 (N=50).  Mean age was 15 years (range, 12\u221217), 70% were male, 68% black, 28% \nAsian.  At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.60 log10 copies/mL, mean CD4+ cell count \n399 cells/mm3 (range, 133-734), and mean CD4+% 20.9% (range, 4.5%-41.1%).  Twenty percent had \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL. \n \nAt Week 48, 44 of 50 (88%) adolescent patients treated with Stribild achieved \nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and 4 achieved HIV-1 RNA \u226550 copies/mL; 1 patient discontinued study \ndrug, and 1 had no virologic data at Week 48.  The mean decrease in HIV-1 RNA was \u22123.16 log10 \ncopies/mL, and the mean increase in CD4+ cell count was 229 cells/mm3.  No emergent resistance to \nStribild was detected through Week 48. \n \nStudies with emtricitabine  \nIn infants and children older than 4 months, the majority of patients taking emtricitabine achieved or \nmaintained complete suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA through 48 weeks (89% \nachieved \u2264 400 copies/ml and 77% achieved \u2264 50 copies/ml). \n \nStudies with tenofovir disoproxil  \nIn study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1-infected treatment experienced patients 12 to < 18 years of age \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an optimised \nbackground regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of tenofovir \ndisoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week 24.  \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine \nBMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double blind phase) were -0.215 \nand -0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment experienced patients 2 to  < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.  At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/mL.  The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/mL at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group.  When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL at week 48. \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 \nand -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group.  One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  \nBMD Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks.  BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Stribild in children under the age of 12 years have not been established (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration of Stribild with food in HIV-1 infected subjects, peak plasma \nconcentrations were observed 4 hours post-dose for elvitegravir, 3 hours post-dose for cobicistat, \n3 hours post-dose for emtricitabine, and 2 hours for tenofovir following the rapid conversion of \ntenofovir disoproxil.  The steady-state mean Cmax, AUCtau, and Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) following multiple \ndoses of Stribild in HIV-1 infected subjects, respectively, were 1.7 \u00b1 0.39 \u00b5g/mL, 23 \u00b1 7.5 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, \nand 0.45 \u00b1 0.26 \u00b5g/mL for elvitegravir, which provides inhibitory quotient of ~ 10 (ratio of Ctrough: \nprotein binding-adjusted IC95 for wild-type HIV-1 virus).  Corresponding steady-state mean Cmax, \nAUCtau, and Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) were 1.1 \u00b1 0.40 \u00b5g/mL, 8.3 \u00b1 3.8 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, and 0.05 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b5g/mL \nfor cobicistat, 1.9 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, 13 \u00b1 4.5 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, and 0.14 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b5g/mL for emtricitabine, and \n0.45 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5g/mL, 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, and 0.1 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b5g/mL for tenofovir. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of Stribild with a light meal (~373 kcal, 20% fat) or \nhigh-fat meal (~800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in increased exposures of elvitegravir and tenofovir.  For \nelvitegravir, Cmax and AUC increased 22% and 36% with a light meal, while increasing 56% and 91% \nwith a high-fat meal, respectively.  The Cmax and AUC of tenofovir increased 20% and 25% \nrespectively with a light meal, while the Cmax was unaffected and AUC increased 25% with a high fat \nmeal.  Cobicistat exposures were unaffected by a light meal and although there was a modest decrease \nof 24% and 18% in Cmax and AUC respectively with a high-fat meal, no difference was observed in its \npharmacoenhancing effect on elvitegravir.  Emtricitabine exposures were unaffected with light or \nhigh-fat meal. \n \nDistribution \n \nElvitegravir is 98-99% bound to human plasma proteins and binding is independent of drug \nconcentration over the range of 1 ng/mL to 1,600 ng/mL.  The mean plasma to blood drug \nconcentration ratio was 1.37.  Cobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean \nplasma to blood drug concentration ratio was 2. \n \nFollowing intravenous administration the volume of distribution of emtricitabine and tenofovir was \napproximately 1,400 mL/kg and 800 mL/kg, respectively.  After oral administration of emtricitabine \nor tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine and tenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body.  \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02 to 200 \u00b5g/mL.  At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to \nblood drug concentration ratio was ~ 1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio was \n~ 4.0.  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, \nrespectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 \u00b5g/mL. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nElvitegravir undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (major route), and glucuronidation by \nUGT1A1/3 enzymes (minor route).  Following oral administration of boosted [14C]elvitegravir, \nelvitegravir was the predominant species in plasma, representing ~94% of the circulating radioactivity.  \nAromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation or glucuronidation metabolites are present in very low levels, \ndisplay considerably lower anti-HIV activity and do not contribute to the overall antiviral activity of \nelvitegravir. \n \nCobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A and/or CYP2D6-mediated oxidation and does not undergo \nglucuronidation.  Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 99% of circulating radioactivity in \nplasma was unchanged cobicistat. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that emtricitabine is not an inhibitor of human CYP450 enzymes.  Following \nadministration of [14C]emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was achieved in \nurine (~ 86%) and faeces (~ 14%).  Thirteen percent of the dose was recovered in the urine as three \nputative metabolites.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to \nform the 3\u2019-sulfoxide diastereomers (~ 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form \n2\u2019-O-glucuronide (~ 4% of dose).  No other metabolites were identifiable. \n \nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP450 enzymes.  Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major \nhuman CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2).  Tenofovir disoproxil had no effect on any of the CYP450 isoforms, except \nCYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction in metabolism of a CYP1A1/2 \nsubstrate was observed. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of [14C]elvitegravir/ritonavir, 94.8% of the dose was recovered in \nfaeces, consistent with the hepatobiliary elimination of elvitegravir; 6.7% of the administered dose \nwas recovered in urine.  The median terminal plasma half-life of elvitegravir following administration \nof Stribild is approximately 12.9 hours. \n \nFollowing oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in faeces \nand urine, respectively.  The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of \nStribild is approximately 3.5 hours and the associated cobicistat exposures provide elvitegravir Ctrough \napproximately 10-fold above the protein-binding adjusted IC95 for wild-type HIV-1 virus. \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \n(human organic anion transporter [hOAT1]) with approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted \nunchanged in urine following intravenous administration.  The apparent clearance of tenofovir \naveraged approximately 307 mL/min.  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately \n210 mL/min, which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration, the \nelimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nElderly \n \nPharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir have not been evaluated in the \nelderly (over 65 years). \n \nGender \n \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for \ncobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nEthnicity \n \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for \ncobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nExposures of elvitegravir and tenofovir in paediatric patients aged 12 to <18 years who received \nStribild in GS-US-236-0112 were increased by 30% and 37% respectively, when compared with \nhistorical adult controls.  Tenofovir exposures were in the range of those observed in tenofovir \ndisoproxil-containing boosted-protease inhibitor regimens.  Exposures of cobicistat and emtricitabine \nin paediatric patients aged 12 to <18 years were similar to exposures achieved in adults.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir or cobicistat in paediatric subjects <12 years of age have not \nbeen fully established. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nA study of pharmacokinetics of cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir was performed in non-HIV-1 infected \nsubjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min).  No clinically relevant \ndifferences in elvitegravir or cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe \nrenal impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of elvitegravir or cobicistat is necessary \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nfor patients with renal impairment.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir are altered in \nsubjects with renal impairment.  In subjects with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min or with end \nstage renal disease requiring dialysis, Cmax, and AUC of emtricitabine and tenofovir were increased \n(see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBoth elvitegravir and cobicistat are primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A study of \npharmacokinetics of cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects \nwith moderate hepatic impairment.  No clinically relevant differences in elvitegravir or cobicistat \npharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects.  \nNo dose adjustment of elvitegravir or cobicistat is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment.  The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir or \ncobicistat has not been studied.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in \nsubjects with hepatic impairment; however, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver \nenzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited.  Clinically relevant changes in tenofovir \npharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were not observed.  Therefore, no tenofovir \ndisoproxil dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \n \nPharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil have not been fully evaluated in \nhepatitis B and/or C virus co-infected patients.  Limited data from population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis (n = 24) indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus infection had no clinically relevant effect on \nthe exposure of boosted elvitegravir. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \n \nThe results reported from a prospective study (IMPAACT P1026s) showed that treatment with \ncobicistat and elvitegravir-containing regimens during pregnancy results in lower elvitegravir and \ncobicistat exposures (Table 5).  \n \nTable 5: Changes in pharmacokinetic parameters from the IMPAACT P1026s study for \nelvitegravir and cobicistat in women receiving cobicistat and elvitegravir-containing regimens \nduring the second and third trimesters of pregnancy compared to paired postpartum data  \n \n\nComparison to paired \npostpartum data, n \n\nMean % change of elvitegravir \npharmacokinetic parametersa \n\nMean % change of cobicistat \npharmacokinetic parametersa \n\nAUC24 Cmax C24 AUC24 Cmax C24 \n2T/PP, n = 14 \u2193 24%b \u2193 8% \u2193 81%b \u2193 44%b \u2193 28%b \u2193 60%b \n3T/PP, n = 24 \u2193 44%b \u2193 28%b \u2193 89%b \u2193 59%b \u2193 38%b \u2193 76%b \n\n2T = second trimester; 3T = third trimester; PP =postpartum \na paired comparisons \nb P<0.10 compared with postpartum \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nElvitegravir was negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test) and negative in an \nin vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg.  In an in vitro chromosomal aberration test, \nelvitegravir was negative with metabolic activation; however, an equivocal response was observed \nwithout activation. \n \nCobicistat was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays.  Ex vivo rabbit \nstudies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT prolongation, and \nmay slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at concentrations at least \n11-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily dose.  In a human clinical \nstudy of 35 healthy subjects, echocardiograms performed at baseline and after receiving 150 mg \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\ncobicistat once daily for at least 15 days indicated no clinically significant change in left ventricular \nfunction. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with cobicistat showed no effects on mating, fertility, \npregnancy or foetal parameters.  However increased postimplantation loss and decreased foetal \nweights were observed in rats associated with significant decreases in maternal body weights at \n125 mg/kg/day. \n \nLong term oral carcinogenicity studies with elvitegravir and cobicistat did not show any carcinogenic \npotential in mice and rats. \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \nNon-clinical data on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional \nstudies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction and \ndevelopment.  Findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels \ngreater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use included \nkidney and bone changes and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was \ndiagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (rats and dogs).  Reproductive \ntoxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \nparameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a peri-\npostnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n \nThe active substances elvitegravir, cobicistat and tenofovir disoproxil are persistent in the \nenvironment. \n \n \n6.

That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV infected patients associated with tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Stribild. \n2. That patients who have previously discontinued treatment with tenofovir disoproxil due to renal \n\ntoxicity should not be treated with Stribild. \n3. That patients should have creatinine clearance calculated and urine glucose and urine protein \n\ndetermined prior to initiating Stribild therapy. \n4. The importance of regular monitoring of creatinine clearance, serum phosphate, urine glucose \n\nand urine protein during Stribild therapy. \n5. The recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence \n\nof additional risk factors for renal impairment. \n6. That cobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in \n\nserum creatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular \nfunction. \n\n7. That patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than \n26.5 \u00b5mol/L (0.3 mg/dL) from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. \n\n8.

What you need to know before you take Stribild \n3. How to take Stribild \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Stribild \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Stribild is and what it is used for \n \nStribild contains four active substances: \n \n\u2022 elvitegravir, an antiretroviral medicine known as an integrase inhibitor \n\u2022 cobicistat, a booster (pharmacokinetic enhancer) of the effects of elvitegravir \n\u2022 emtricitabine, an antiretroviral medicine known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor \n\n(NRTI) \n\u2022 tenofovir disoproxil, an antiretroviral medicine known as a nucleotide reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NtRTI) \n \nStribild is a single tablet regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection \nin adults. \n \nStribild is also used to treat HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at \nleast 35 kg, and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that have caused side effects. \n \nStribild reduces the amount of HIV in your body.  This will improve your immune system and \nreduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Stribild \n \nDo not take Stribild \n \n\u2022 If you are allergic to elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, \n\nor any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n\u2022 If you stopped treatment with any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil on the advice of \n\nyour doctor following problems with your kidney function. \n\u2022 If you are taking one of these medicines: \n\n- alfuzosin (used to treat an enlarged prostate gland) \n- amiodarone, quinidine (used to correct irregular heartbeats) \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n- dabigatran (used to prevent and treat blood clots) \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (used to prevent seizures) \n- rifampicin (used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections) \n- dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergometrine (used to treat migraine headache) \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems) \n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and \n\nanxiety) or products that contain it \n- lovastatin, simvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n- pimozide, lurasidone (used to treat abnormal thoughts or feelings) \n- sildenafil (used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension \u2013 a lung disease that makes \n\nbreathing difficult) \n- orally administered midazolam, triazolam (used to help you sleep and/or relieve \n\nanxiety) \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, you should not take Stribild and you should tell your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stribild. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Stribild you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Stribild: \n\u2022 If you have kidney problems, or have had kidney problems, or if tests have shown problems \n\nwith your kidneys.  Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with Stribild. \n \n\nStribild may affect your kidneys.  Before starting treatment, your doctor will order blood tests to \nassess your kidney function.  Your doctor will also order blood tests during treatment to monitor \nyour kidneys. \n\n \nStribild is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other \nmedicines and Stribild).  If this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney function \nmore frequently. \n \n\n\u2022 If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B infection liver problems may become worse after you stop taking \nStribild.  It\u2019s important not to stop taking Stribild without talking to your doctor: see section 3, \nDo not stop taking Stribild. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are over 65.  Stribild has not been studied in patients over 65 years of age.  If you are \n\nolder than this and are prescribed Stribild, your doctor will monitor you carefully. \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor before taking Stribild. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nWhile you are taking Stribild \n \nOnce you start taking Stribild, look out for: \n \n\u2022 any signs of inflammation or infection \n\u2022 bone problems \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age.  The use of Stribild in children below \n12 years of age and who weigh less than 35kg has not been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Stribild \n \nThere are some medicines that should never be taken with Stribild. \nThese are mentioned above under the heading \u201cDo not take Stribild - If you are taking one of these \nmedicines\u201d. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines or have recently taken any.  \nStribild may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Stribild or other medicines in \nyour blood may be affected.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any \nside effects worse.  In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood \nlevels. \n \nIt is especially important to talk to your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n \n\u2022 any other medicines containing: \n\n- tenofovir disoproxil  \n- tenofovir alafenamide \n- lamivudine \n- adefovir dipivoxil \n\n \n\u2022 medicines that may damage your kidneys, examples include: \n\n- aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin, neomycin and gentamicin), vancomycin (for \nbacterial infections) \n\n- foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (for viral infections) \n- amphotericin B, pentamidine (for fungal infections) \n- interleukin-2, also called aldesleukin (to treat cancer) \n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) \n\n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following types of medicines: \n \n\u2022 antifungals, used to treat fungal infections, such as: \n\n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole and posaconazole \n\u2022 antivirals, used to treat hepatitis C infection: \n\n- ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir \n\u2022 antibiotics, used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis, containing: \n\n- rifabutin, clarithromycin or telithromycin \n\u2022 antidepressants, used to treat depression: \n\n- medicines containing trazodone or escitalopram \n\u2022 sedatives and hypnotics, used to treat anxiety: \n\n- buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam and zolpidem \n\u2022 immunosuppressants, used to control your body\u2019s immune response after a transplant, such as: \n\n- ciclosporin, sirolimus and tacrolimus \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n\u2022 corticosteroids including: \n- betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, triamcinolone. \nThese medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory \nconditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory conditions. If alternatives \ncannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation and under close \nmonitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects. \n\n\u2022 medicines used to treat diabetes: \n- metformin \n\n\u2022 contraceptive pill, used to prevent pregnancy \n\u2022 erectile dysfunction medicines, used to treat impotence, such as: \n\n- sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil \n\u2022 heart medicines, such as: \n\n- digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone, metoprolol, \ntimolol, amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine and verapamil \n\n\u2022 medicines used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension: \n- bosentan \n\n\u2022 anticoagulants, used to prevent and treat blood clots, such as: \n- warfarin, edoxaban, apixaban and rivaroxaban \n\n\u2022 bronchodilators, used to treat asthma and other lung-related problems: \n- salmeterol \n\n\u2022 cholesterol lowering medicines, such as: \n- rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and pitavastatin \n\n\u2022 medicines used to treat gout: \n- colchicine \n\n\u2022 antiplatelets, used to reduce the risk of blood clots such as: \n- clopidogrel  \n\n\u2022 medicines or oral supplements containing minerals (such as magnesium, aluminium, \ncalcium, iron, zinc), such as: \n- mineral supplements, vitamins (including multivitamins), antacids and laxatives  \n\uf0e0 If you are taking medicines, oral supplements, antacids or laxatives containing minerals \n\n(such as magnesium, aluminium, calcium, iron, zinc), take them at least 4 hours before or \nat least 4 hours after Stribild. \n\n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines.  Do not stop your treatment \n\nwithout contacting your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are \n\nplanning to have a baby.  Pregnant women should not take Stribild.  The amount of this \nmedicine in your blood may decrease during pregnancy which may stop it from working \nproperly. \n\n\u2022 Use effective contraception while taking Stribild. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Stribild.  This is because some of the active substances in \nthis medicine pass into human breast milk.  If you are a woman with HIV it is recommended that you \ndo not breast-feed to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nStribild can cause dizziness, tiredness or insomnia.  If you are affected while taking Stribild, do not \ndrive and do not use any tools or machines. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nStribild contains lactose \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nStribild contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Stribild \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose for adults and adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least \n35 kg: \n \n\u2022 One tablet each day by mouth, with food.  Do not chew, crush or split the tablet. \n \nAlways take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is \nfully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the \ndose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you are taking medicines, oral supplements, antacids or laxatives containing minerals (such as \nmagnesium, aluminium, calcium, iron, zinc), take them at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after \nStribild. \n \nIf you take more Stribild than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Stribild you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Stribild \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Stribild. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n\u2022 and you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Stribild, you must take the tablet \n\nas soon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n\u2022 and you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Stribild, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Stribild, take another tablet with food. \n \nDo not stop taking Stribild \n \nDo not stop taking Stribild without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Stribild can seriously affect \nyour response to future treatment.  If Stribild is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Stribild tablets. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nWhen your supply of Stribild starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. \n \nIf you have HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Stribild \ntreatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after \nstopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not \nrecommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection (such as yellowing of your skin or \nthe white part of your eyes, dark \u201ctea-coloured\u201d urine, light-coloured stools, loss of appetite for \nseveral days or longer, feeling or being sick, or stomach-area pain). \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by Stribild or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease \nitself. \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n \n\u2022 Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side \n\neffect of some HIV medicines.  Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women \u2013 particularly if \nthey are overweight and in people with liver disease.  The following may be signs of lactic \nacidosis: \n- deep, rapid breathing \n- tiredness or drowsiness \n- feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) \n- stomach pain \n\n\uf0e0 If you think you may have lactic acidosis, tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\u2022 Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak \nimmune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement \nin the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been \npresent with no obvious symptoms.  In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune \ndisorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may \nalso occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection.  \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment.  If you notice any \nsymptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or \nhyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n\uf0e0 If you notice any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects \n(may affect at least 1 in every 10 patients treated) \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 weakness \n\u2022 headache, dizziness \n\u2022 rash \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 decreased phosphate in your blood \n\u2022 increased levels of creatine kinase in the blood that may result in muscle pain and weakness \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect 1 to 10 in every 100 patients treated) \n\u2022 decreased appetite \n\u2022 difficulty sleeping (insomnia), abnormal dreams \n\u2022 pain, stomach pain \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 feeling bloated \n\u2022 constipation, wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), \n\nwhich may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin \nin patches \n\n\u2022 other allergic reactions \n\u2022 tiredness \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 low white blood cell count (which can make you more prone to infection) \n\u2022 increased sugar, fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin in your blood \n\u2022 liver and pancreas problems \n\u2022 increased levels of creatinine in your blood \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients treated) \n\u2022 suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients who have had depression or mental health \n\nproblems before), depression \n\u2022 back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure.  Your doctor may do blood tests \n\nto see if your kidneys are working properly \n\u2022 damage to kidney tubule cells \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n\u2022 pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) \n\u2022 breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 anaemia (low red blood cell count) \n\u2022 decreased levels of potassium in the blood \n\u2022 changes to your urine \n \nRare side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients treated) \n\u2022 lactic acidosis (see Possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately) \n\u2022 yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the \n\nliver (hepatitis) \n\u2022 fatty liver \n\u2022 inflammation of the kidney (nephritis) \n\u2022 passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) \n\u2022 softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \nThe breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in \nfractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may \noccur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. \n \n\uf0e0 If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n\u2022 Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Stribild \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement \n\n \nOther effects in children  \n\u2022 Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including \n\n-  darkening of the skin in patches  \n\u2022 Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia).  \n\n-  this may cause the child to be tired or breathless  \n \n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \n\uf0e0 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.

check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. recommended dose for adults and adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day by mouth, with food. do not chew, crush or split the tablet. always take the dose recommended by your doctor. this is to make sure that your medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. do not change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. if you are taking medicines, oral supplements, antacids or laxatives containing minerals (such as magnesium, aluminium, calcium, iron, zinc), take them at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after stribild. if you take more stribild than you should if you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of stribild you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, possible side effects). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take stribild it is important not to miss a dose of stribild. if you do miss a dose: and you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take stribild, you must take the tablet as soon as possible. always take the tablet with food. then take the next dose as usual. and you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take stribild, then do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. if you vomit less than 1 hour after taking stribild, take another tablet with food. do not stop taking stribild do not stop taking stribild without talking to your doctor. stopping stribild can seriously affect your response to future treatment. if stribild is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you restart taking stribild tablets. when your supply of stribild starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. this is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. the disease may then become harder to treat. if you have hiv infection and hepatitis b, it is especially important not to stop your stribild treatment without talking to your doctor first. you may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis b infection (such as yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes, dark \"tea-coloured\" urine, light-coloured stools, loss of appetite for several days or longer, feeling or being sick, or stomach-area pain). if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "stribild", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 12, "EndOffset": 25},

partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. when treating hiv infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are caused by stribild or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the hiv disease itself. possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of some hiv medicines. lactic acidosis occurs more often in women particularly if they are overweight and in people with liver disease. the following may be signs of lactic acidosis: - deep, rapid breathing - tiredness or drowsiness - feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) - stomach pain if you think you may have lactic acidosis, tell your doctor immediately. any signs of inflammation or infection. in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. if you notice any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor immediately. very common side effects (may affect at least 1 in every 10 patients treated) diarrhoea 52 vomiting feeling sick (nausea) weakness headache, dizziness rash tests may also show: decreased phosphate in your blood increased levels of creatine kinase in the blood that may result in muscle pain and weakness common side effects (may affect 1 to 10 in every 100 patients treated) decreased appetite difficulty sleeping (insomnia), abnormal dreams pain, stomach pain problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) feeling bloated constipation, wind (flatulence) rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), which may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin in patches other allergic reactions tiredness tests may also show: low white blood cell count (which can make you more prone to infection) increased sugar, fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin in your blood liver and pancreas problems increased levels of creatinine in your blood uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients treated) suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before), depression back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure. your doctor may do blood tests to see if your kidneys are working properly damage to kidney tubule cells swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness tests may also show: anaemia (low red blood cell count) decreased levels of potassium in the blood changes to your urine rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients treated) lactic acidosis (see possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately) yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) fatty liver inflammation of the kidney (nephritis) passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) 53 the breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. if any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. other effects that may be seen during hiv treatment the frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). bone problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as stribild may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are: - joint stiffness - joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) - difficulty with movement other effects in children children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including - darkening of the skin in patches children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia). - this may cause the child to be tired or breathless if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more
