CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTandemact is indicated as second line treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who \nshow intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated and who are already treated \nwith a combination of pioglitazone and glimepiride. \n \nAfter initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess \nadequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate \nresponse, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, \nprescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained \n(see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Tandemact is one tablet taken once daily.  \n \nIf patients report hypoglycaemia, the dose of Tandemact should be reduced or free combination \ntherapy should be considered.  \n \nIf patients are receiving pioglitazone in combination with a sulphonylurea other than glimepiride, \npatients should be stabilised with concomitant pioglitazone and glimepiride before switching to \nTandemact. \n \nSpecial populations  \n\nElderly \nPhysicians should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually, \nparticularly when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and \ncardiac failure). \n \nRenal impairment \nTandemact should not be used in patients with severe renal function disorders (creatinine clearance \n< 30 ml/min, see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTandemact should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Tandemact in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe tablets are taken orally shortly before or with the first main meal. The tablets should be swallowed \nwith a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTandemact is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or other \n\nsulphonylureas or sulphonamides \n- Cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) \n- Current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer \n- Uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria \n- Hepatic impairment \n- Type 1 diabetes mellitus  \n- Diabetic coma \n- Diabetic ketoacidosis  \n- Severe renal function disorders (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n- Pregnancy \n- Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience of other oral anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products added to \ntreatment with Tandemact or concomitantly administered glimepiride and pioglitazone.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nWhen meals are taken at irregular hours or skipped altogether, treatment with Tandemact may lead to \nhypoglycaemia due to the sulphonylurea component. Symptoms can almost always be promptly \ncontrolled by immediate intake of carbohydrates (sugar). Artificial sweeteners have no effect. \n \nIt is known from other sulphonylureas that, despite initially successful countermeasures, \nhypoglycaemia may recur. Severe hypoglycaemia or prolonged hypoglycaemia, only temporarily \ncontrolled by the usual amounts of sugar, require immediate medical treatment and occasionally \nhospitalisation. \n \nTreatment with Tandemact requires regular monitoring of glycaemic control. \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \n \nPioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When \ntreating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure \n(e.g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease or the elderly), physicians \nshould start with the lowest available dose of pioglitazone and increase the dose gradually. Patients \nshould be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema; particularly those \nwith reduced cardiac reserve. There have been post-marketing cases of cardiac failure reported when \npioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Since \ninsulin and pioglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may \nincrease the risk of oedema. Post marketing cases of peripheral oedema and cardiac failure have also \nbeen reported in patients with concomitant use of pioglitazone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Tandemact should be discontinued if any deterioration in \ncardiac state occurs. \n \nA cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease. Pioglitazone or placebo was \nadded to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years. This study showed an \nincrease in reports of heart failure; however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.  \n \nElderly \n \n\nCombination use with insulin should be considered with caution in the elderly because of increased \nrisk of serious heart failure. \n \nIn light of age-related risks (especially bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure), the balance of \nbenefits and risks should be considered carefully both before and during treatment in the elderly. \n \nBladder cancer \n \nCases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials \nwith pioglitazone (19 cases from 12,506 patients, 0.15%) than in control groups (7 cases from \n10,212 patients, 0.07%) HR=2.64 (95% CI 1.11-6.31, p=0.029). After excluding patients in whom \nexposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were \n7 cases (0.06%) on pioglitazone and 2 cases (0.02%) in control groups. Epidemiological studies have \nalso suggested a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone, \nalthough not all studies identified a statistically significant increased risk. \n \nRisk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks \ninclude age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents \ne.g. cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region). Any macroscopic haematuria \nshould be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPatients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if macroscopic haematuria \nor other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment. \n \nLiver function \n \nThere have been rare reports of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction during \npost-marketing experience with pioglitazone and glimepiride (see section 4.8). Although in very rare \ncases fatal outcome has been reported, causal relationship has not been established. \nIt is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with Tandemact undergo periodic monitoring of \nliver enzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with Tandemact in \nall patients. Therapy with Tandemact should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver \nenzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 x upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease.  \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy with Tandemact, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored \nperiodically based on clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 x upper limit of normal \nduring Tandemact therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels \nremain > 3 x the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops \nsymptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision \nwhether to continue the patient on therapy with Tandemact should be guided by clinical judgement \npending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, the medicinal product should be discontinued. \n \nWeight gain \n \nIn clinical trials with pioglitazone and sulphonylurea monotherapy or in combination there was \nevidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases \nassociated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure \ntherefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control. \nPatients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet. \n \nHaematology \n \nRare changes in haematology have been observed with glimepiride treatment (see section 4.8). \nTreatment with Tandemact therefore requires regular haematological monitoring (especially \nleucocytes and platelets). \n \nDuring therapy with pioglitazone there was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative \nreduction) and haematocrit (4.1% relative reduction), consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes \nwere seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6-4.1% relative reductions) and to a \nlesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1-2% and haematocrit 1-3.2% relative \nreductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. \n \nTreatment of patients with G6PD-deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to haemolytic anaemia. \nSince glimepiride belongs to the chemical class of sulfonylurea medicinal products, caution should be \nused in patients with G6PD-deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. \n \nEye disorders \n \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should \nbe considered. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome \n \nAs a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic \novarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. \nPatients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if \npregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nOthers \n \nAn increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse reactions \nreports of bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n \nThe fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with \npioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator. The observed \nexcess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per \n100 patient years of use. \n \nSome epidemiological studies have suggested a similarly increased risk of fracture in both men and \nwomen. \n \nThe risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with pioglitazone \n(see section 4.8). \n \nPioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 \ninhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored \nclosely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nThe tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for Tandemact, however, the concomitant use of the \nactive substances in patients in clinical use has not resulted in any unexpected interactions. The \nfollowing statements reflect the information available on the individual active substances (pioglitazone \nand glimepiride). \n \nPioglitazone \n \nCo-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported \nto result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. A decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be \nneeded when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer \nof cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The \npioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close \nmonitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Co-administration of \npioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea. \nStudies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/9 and 3A4. \nIn vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450. Interactions with \nsubstances metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel \nblockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGlimepiride \n \nIf glimepiride is taken simultaneously with certain other medicinal products, both undesired increases \nand decreases in the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride can occur. For this reason, other medicinal \nproducts should only be taken with Tandemact with the knowledge (or at the prescription) of the \ndoctor. \n \nBased on the experience with glimepiride and with other sulphonylureas the following interactions \nhave to be mentioned. \n \nPotentiation of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus, in some instances hypoglycaemia may \noccur when one of the following active substances is taken, for example: \n \nphenylbutazone, azapropazone and oxyfenbutazone \ninsulin and oral antidiabetic products \nmetformin \nsalicylates and p-amino-salicylic acid \nanabolic steroids and male sex hormones \nchloramphenicol \nclarithromycin \ncoumarin anticoagulants \ndisopyramide \nfenfluramine \nfibrates \nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \nfluoxetine \nallopurinol \nsympatholytics \ncyclo-, tro- and iphosphamides \nsulphinpyrazone \ncertain long-acting sulphonamides \ntetracyclines \nMAO-inhibitors \nquinolone antibiotics \nprobenecid \nmiconazole \npentoxyfylline (high dose parenteral) \ntritoqualine \nfluconazole \n \nWeakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus raised blood glucose levels may occur when \none of the following active substances is taken, for example: \n \noestrogens and progestagens, \nsaluretics, thiazide diuretics, \nthyroid stimulating agents, glucocorticoids, \nphenothiazine derivatives, chlorpromazine, \nadrenaline and sympathicomimetics, \nnicotinic acid (high doses) and nicotinic acid derivatives, \nlaxatives (long-term use), \nphenytoin, diazoxide, \nglucagon, barbiturates and rifampicin. \nacetozolamide \n \nH2 antagonists, betablockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of \nthe blood glucose lowering effect. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nUnder the influence of sympatholytic active substances such as betablockers, clonidine, guanethidine \nand reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counterregulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent. \n \nAlcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride in an unpredictable \nfashion. \n \nGlimepiride may either potentiate or weaken the effects of coumarin derivatives. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n \n\nTandemact is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If a \npatient wishes to become pregnant, treatment with Tandemact should be discontinued. \n \nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to pioglitazone \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of pioglitazone in pregnant women. Studies of pioglitazone in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nRisk related to glimepiride \nThere are no adequate data from the use of glimepiride in pregnant women. Animal studies have \nshown reproductive toxicity which was most likely related to the pharmacological action \n(hypoglycaemia) of glimepiride.  \n \nTandemact is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). If a pregnancy occurs, treatment \nwith Tandemact should be discontinued. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSulphonylurea-derivatives like glimepiride pass into the breast milk. Pioglitazone has been shown to \nbe present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk.  \n \nTandemact is contra-indicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \n\nIn animal fertility studies with pioglitazone, there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or \nfertility index. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTandemact has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The patient’s ability to \nconcentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia from \nglimepiride or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations \nwhere these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warnings of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \nPatients who experience visual disturbance should be cautious when driving or using machines. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials have been conducted with co-administered pioglitazone and glimepiride (see \nsection 5.1). Hypoglycaemic reactions mostly occur immediately due to the sulphonylurea component \nof Tandemact. Symptoms can almost always be promptly controlled by immediate intake of \ncarbohydrates (sugar). This is a serious reaction which may occur uncommonly (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n(see section 4.4). Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, erythrocytopenia, \ngranulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia and pancytopenia may occur rarely \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) (see section 4.4). Other reactions such as bone fracture, weight increase and \noedema may occur commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported in double-blind studies and post marketing experience are listed below as \nMedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing incidence \nfollowed by decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nAdverse reaction Frequency of adverse reactions \n Pioglitazone Glimepiride Tandemact \nInfections and infestations    \nupper respiratory tract infection common  common \nsinusitis uncommon  uncommon \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified \n(including cysts and polyps) \n\n   \n\nbladder cancer uncommon  uncommon \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders    \nchanges in haematology1  rare rare \nImmune system disorders     \nallergic shock2  very rare very rare \nallergic vasculitis2  very rare very rare \nhypersensitivity and allergic reactions3 not known  not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders    \nhypoglycaemia   uncommon \nappetite increased   uncommon \nNervous system disorders    \ndizziness   common \nhypo-aesthesia common  common \nheadache   uncommon \ninsomnia uncommon  uncommon \nEye disorders    \nvisual disturbance4 common  uncommon \nmacular oedema not known  not known \nEar and labyrinth disorders    \nvertigo   uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders5    \nflatulence   common \nvomiting  very rare very rare \ndiarrhoea  very rare very rare \nnausea  very rare very rare \nabdominal pain  very rare very rare \nabdominal pressure  very rare very rare \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAdverse reaction Frequency of adverse reactions \n Pioglitazone Glimepiride Tandemact \nfeeling of fullness in the stomach  very rare very rare \nHepatobiliary disorders6    \nhepatitis  very rare very rare \nimpairment of liver function (with cholestasis and \njaundice) \n\n very rare very rare \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders    \nsweating   uncommon \nhypersensitivity to light  very rare very rare \nurticaria2  not known not known \nitching2  not known not known \nrash2  not known not known \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders    \nbone fracture7 common  common \nRenal and urinary disorders    \nglycosuria   uncommon \nproteinuria   uncommon \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n   \n\noedema8   common \nfatigue   uncommon \nInvestigations    \nweight increased9 common common common \nincreased lactic dehydrogenase    uncommon \ndecrease in sodium serum concentrations  very rare very rare \nalanine aminotransferase increase10 not known  not known \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n1 Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, erythrocytopenia, granulocytopenia, \nagranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia and pancyto-penia may occur. These are in general reversible \nupon discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2 In very rare cases mild hypersensitivity reactions may develop into serious reactions with dyspnoea, \nfall in blood pressure and sometimes shock. Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as \nitching, rash, and urticaria. Cross allergenicity with sulphonylureas, sulphonamides or related \nsubstances is possible. \n \n3 Postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with pioglitazone have been \nreported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria.  \n \n4 Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood \nglucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other \nhypoglycaemic medicinal products. \n \n5 Gastro-intestinal complaints are very rare and seldom lead to discontinuation of therapy. \n \n6 Elevation of liver enzymes may occur. In very rare cases, impairment of liver function (e.g. with \ncholestasis and jaundice) may develop, as well as hepatitis which may progress to liver failure. \n \n\n7 A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised, \ncomparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8,100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated \ngroups and 7,400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration. A higher rate of \nfractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%). No increase in \nfracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%). \n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of \npioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per \n100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator. The observed excess risk of fractures for \nwomen on pioglitazone in this study is therefore 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years of use. No increase \nin fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). \nPost-marketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4). \n \n8 Oedema was reported in 6-9% of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled \nclinical trials. The oedema rates for comparator groups (sulphonylurea, metformin) were 2-5%. The \nreports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of \ntreatment. \n \n9 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy \nwas 2 – 3 kg over one year. This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group. In \ncombination trials pioglitazone added to a sulphonylurea resulted in a mean weight increase over one \nyear of 2.8 kg.  \n \n10 In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the \nupper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea \ncomparator groups. Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone.  \n \nIn controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the \nsame as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used in \ncombination therapy with insulin. In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major \nmacrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than \nwith placebo, when added to therapy that included in insulin. However, this did not lead to an increase \nin mortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher \npercentage of patients with heart failure was observed in patients aged ≥ 65 years compared with those \nless than 65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the incidence \nof heart failure was 8.2% in those ≥ 65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than 65 years. Heart \nfailure has been reported with marketing use of pioglitazone, and more frequently when pioglitazone \nwas used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of \n45 mg daily. The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/day for four days, then 180 mg/day for seven \ndays was not associated with any symptoms. \n \nAfter ingestion of an overdose of glimepiride, hypoglycaemia may occur, lasting from 12 to 72 hours, \nand may recur after initial recovery. Symptoms may not be present for up to 24 hours after ingestion. \nIn general observation in hospital is recommended. Nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain may occur. \nThe hypoglycaemia may in general be accompanied by neurological symptoms like restlessness, \ntremor, visual disturbances, coordination problems, sleepiness, coma and convulsions. \n \nTreatment of overdose of Tandemact primarily consists of preventing absorption of glimepiride by \ninducing vomiting and then drinking water or lemonade with activated charcoal (adsorbent) and \nsodium-sulphate (laxative). If large quantities have been ingested, gastric lavage is indicated, followed \nby activated charcoal and sodium-sulphate. In case of (severe) overdose hospitalisation in an intensive \ncare department is indicated. Start the administration of glucose as soon as possible, if necessary by a \n\n\n\n12 \n\nbolus intravenous injection of 50 ml of a 50% solution, followed by an infusion of a 10% solution with \nstrict monitoring of blood glucose. Further treatment should be symptomatic. \n \nIn particular when treating hypoglycaemia due to accidental intake of Tandemact in infants and young \nchildren, the dose of glucose given must be carefully controlled to avoid the possibility of producing \ndangerous hyperglycaemia. Blood glucose should be closely monitored. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs; ATC code: A10BD06. \n \nTandemact combines two antihyperglycaemic active substances with complementary mechanisms of \naction to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pioglitazone, a member \nof the thiazolidinedione class and glimepiride, a member of the sulphonylurea class. \nThiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and sulphonylureas primarily by \ninducing insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. \n \nPioglitazone \n \nPioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone appears to act \nvia activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading \nto increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals. Treatment with \npioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose \ndisposal in the case of insulin resistance. \n \nFasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma \ninsulin concentrations. A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to \ntwo years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the \nfirst six months of therapy). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients \ntreated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone. At two years, glycaemic control (defined as \nHbA1c < 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of \npatients on gliclazide. In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with \ngliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in \nHbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year. The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during \nthe second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide. \n \nIn a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin \noptimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months. Patients receiving \npioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin \nalone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group. \n \nHOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin \nsensitivity. Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect. \n \nIn one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the \nalbumin/creatinine ratio compared to baseline. \n \nThe effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in \ntype 2 diabetics. Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain. Visceral fat was \nsignificantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass. Similar changes in \nbody fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. \nIn most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased \n\n\n\n13 \n\nHDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically \nsignificant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels. In clinical trials of up to two years duration, \npioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-cholesterol \nlevels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide. Pioglitazone did not cause statistically \nsignificant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions were \nobserved with metformin and gliclazide. In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, \npioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and \nhepatically synthesised triglycerides. These effects were independent of pioglitazone’s effects on \nglycaemia and were statistically significantly different to glibenclamide. \n \nIn PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \npre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to \nexisting antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years. The study population had an \naverage age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Approximately one third of \npatients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea. To be eligible \npatients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous \ncardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, \nor peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial \ninfarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke. Approximately half of the study population had at \nleast two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria. Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving \ncardiovascular medicinal products (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium \nchannel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, acetylsalicylic acid, statins, fibrates). \n \nAlthough the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause \nmortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, \ncoronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term \ncardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone. However, the incidence of oedema, weight gain \nand heart failure were increased. No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed. \n \nGlimepiride \n \nGlimepiride acts mainly by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. \nAs with other sulphonylureas this effect is based on an increase of responsiveness of the pancreatic \nbeta cells to the physiological glucose stimulus. In addition, glimepiride seems to have pronounced \nextrapancreatic effects also postulated for other sulphonylureas. \n \nInsulin release \n\nSulphonylureas regulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the beta \ncell membrane. Closing the potassium channel induces depolarisation of the beta cell and results – by \nopening of calcium channels – in an increased influx of calcium into the cell. This leads to insulin \nrelease through exocytosis. Glimepiride binds with a high exchange rate to a beta cell membrane \nprotein which is associated with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel but which is different from the \nusual sulphonylurea binding site. \n \nExtrapancreatic activity \n\nThe extrapancreatic effects are for example an improvement of the sensitivity of the peripheral tissue \nfor insulin and a decrease of the insulin uptake by the liver.  \n \nThe uptake of glucose from blood into peripheral muscle and fat tissues occurs via a special transport \nproteins, located in the cells membrane. The transport of glucose in these tissues is the rate limiting \nstep in the use of glucose. Glimepiride increases very rapidly the number of active glucose transport \nmolecules in the plasma membranes of muscle and fat cells, resulting in stimulated glucose uptake. \nGlimepiride increases the activity of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C which \nmay be correlated with the induced lipogenesis and glycogenesis in isolated fat and muscle cells.  \nGlimepiride inhibits the glucose production in the liver by increasing the intracellular concentration of \nfructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which in turn inhibits the gluconeogenesis. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nGeneral \n\nIn healthy persons, the minimum effective oral dose is approximately 0.6 mg. The effect of \nglimepiride is dose-dependent and reproducible. The physiological response to acute physical \nexercise, reduction of insulin secretion, is still present under glimepiride. \n \nThere was no significant difference in effect regardless of whether glimepiride was given 30 minutes \nor immediately before a meal. In diabetic patients, good metabolic control over 24 hours can be \nachieved with a single daily dose. \n \nAlthough the hydroxy metabolite of glimepiride caused a small but significant decrease in serum \nglucose in healthy persons, it accounts for only a minor part of the total effect. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTandemact in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTandemact  \n \nStudies in human volunteers have shown Tandemact to be bioequivalent to the administration of \npioglitazone and glimepiride given as separate tablets.  \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nTandemact. \n \nPioglitazone \n \nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of \nunchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration. Proportional increases of \nthe plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2-60 mg. Steady state is achieved after \n4-7 days of dosing. Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites. \nAbsorption is not influenced by food intake. Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%. \n \nDistribution \n\nThe estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 L/kg. \n \nPioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%). \n \nBiotransformation \n\nPioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. \nThis is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser \ndegree. Three of the six identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, and M-IV). When activity, \nconcentrations and protein binding are taken into account, pioglitazone and metabolite M-III \ncontribute equally to efficacy. On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold \nthat of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450. \nThere is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A, 2C8/9, and 3A4 in man. \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Concomitant \nadministration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with \n\n\n\n15 \n\nrifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the \nplasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5). \n \n\nElimination \n\nFollowing oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in \nfaeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%). In animals, only a small amount of unchanged \npioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces. The mean plasma elimination half-life of \nunchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nSingle dose studies demonstrate linearity of pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. \n \nElderly \n\nSteady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower \nthan those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is \nsimilar. Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nTotal plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged, but with an increased volume of distribution. \nIntrinsic clearance is therefore reduced, coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone. \n \nGlimepiride \n \nAbsorption \n\nThe bioavailability of glimepiride after oral administration is complete. Food intake has no relevant \ninfluence on absorption, only absorption rate is slightly diminished. Maximum serum concentrations \n(Cmax) are reached approximately 2.5 hours after oral intake (mean 0.3 µg/mL during multiple dosing \nof 4 mg daily).  \n \nDistribution \n\nGlimepiride has a very low distribution volume (approximately 8.8 litres) which is roughly equal to \nthe albumin distribution space, high protein binding (> 99%), and a low clearance (approximately \n48 mL/min).  \n \nIn animals, glimepiride is excreted in milk. Glimepiride is transferred to the placenta. Passage of the \nblood brain barrier is low. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nMean dominant serum half-life, which is of relevance for the serum concentrations under \nmultiple-dose conditions, is about 5 to 8 hours. After high doses, slightly longer half-lives were noted. \n \nAfter a single dose of radiolabelled glimepiride, 58% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine, \nand 35% in the faeces. No unchanged substance was detected in the urine. Two metabolites – most \nprobably resulting from hepatic metabolism (major enzyme is CYP2C9) – were identified both in \nurine and faeces: the hydroxy derivative and the carboxy derivative. After oral administration of \nglimepiride, the terminal half-lives of those metabolites were 3 to 6 and 5 to 6 hours respectively. \n \nComparison of single and multiple once-daily dosing revealed no significant differences in \npharmacokinetics, and the intra-individual variability was very low. There was no relevant \naccumulation. \n \nPharmacokinetics were similar in males and females, as well as in young and elderly (above 65 years) \npatients. In patients with low creatinine clearance, there was a tendency for glimepiride clearance to \n\n\n\n16 \n\nincrease and for average serum concentrations to decrease, most probably resulting from a more rapid \nelimination because of lower protein binding. Renal elimination of the two metabolites was impaired. \nOverall no additional risk of accumulation is to be assumed in such patients. \n \nPharmacokinetics in five non-diabetic patients after bile duct surgery were similar to those in healthy \npersons. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nThere is a linear relationship between dose and both Cmax and AUC (area under the time/concentration \ncurve).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combined products of Tandemact. The following data \nare findings in studies performed with pioglitazone or glimepiride individually. \n \nPioglitazone \n \nIn toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric \ncardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. \nIn addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed. These findings were observed \nacross species at plasma concentrations  4 times the clinical exposure. Foetal growth restriction was \napparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in \ndiminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during \npregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.  \n \nPioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro \ngenotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) \nof the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.  \n \nThe formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was \npostulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A \n24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in \nan increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly \ndecreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated the \nhyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. The \nrelevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.  \n \nThere was no tumourigenic response in mice of either sex. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not \nseen in dogs or monkeys treated with pioglitazone for up to 12 months. \n \nIn an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other \nthiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is \nunknown. \n \nGlimepiride \n \nPreclinical effects observed occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of the maximum human \nexposure as to indicate little relevance to clinical use, or were due to the pharmacodynamic action \n(hypoglycaemia) of the compound. This finding is based on conventional safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproduction toxicity studies. In the latter \n(covering embryotoxicity, teratogenicity and developmental toxicity), undesirable effects observed \nwere considered to be secondary to the hypoglycaemic effects induced by the compound in dams and \nin offspring. \n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tandemact is and what it is used for \n2.

What Tandemact is and what it is used for  \n \nTandemact contains pioglitazone and glimepiride which are anti-diabetic medicines, used to control \nblood sugar level.  \n \nIt is used in adults when metformin is not suitable to treat type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes \nmellitus. This type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood where the body either does not produce \nenough insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels), or cannot effectively use the insulin it \nproduces. \n \nTandemact helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by increasing \nthe amount of insulin available and helping your body make better use of it. Your doctor will check \nwhether Tandemact is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tandemact \n \nDo not take Tandemact: \n- if you are allergic to pioglitazone, glimepiride, other sulphonylureas or sulphonamides, or any \n\nof the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past \n- if you have liver disease \n- if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with rapid weight loss, nausea or \n\nvomiting) \n- if you have severe problems with your kidneys \n- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer \n- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked \n- if you have insulin dependent diabetes (type 1) \n- if you are in a diabetic coma \n- if you are pregnant \n- if you are breast-feeding \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tandemact (see also section 4) \n- if you have a problem with your heart. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes \n\nmellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin \ntogether experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if \nyou experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in \nweight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n\n- if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over \n75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and \nswelling, you must also tell your doctor. \n\n- if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back \nof the eye), talk to your doctor if you notice any change to your vision.  \n\n- if you have a problem with your liver. Before you start taking Tandemact you will have a blood \nsample taken to check your liver function. This check should be repeated at intervals. Inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms suggesting a problem with your liver \n(like feeling sick without explanations, vomiting, stomach ache, tiredness, loss of appetite \nand/or dark urine) as your liver function should be checked.  \n\n- if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased \npossibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Tandemact. If \nthis applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned \npregnancy. \n\n- if you are already taking other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. \n- if you have problems with your enzyme called Glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase since it can \n\ndecrease your red cells. \n \n\nYou may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). Your doctor may take blood tests to \nmonitor your blood cell levels and liver function. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nWhen you take Tandemact, your blood sugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). If \nyou experience symptoms of hypoglycaemia such as cold sweat, tiredness, headache, rapid heartbeat, \nhunger pangs, irritability, nervousness or nausea, you should take some sugar to increase your blood \nsugar level again. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information if you are not sure how to \nrecognise this. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit \njuice. \n \nBroken bones \nA higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your \ndoctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Tandemact \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because some medicines can weaken or strengthen the effect of Tandemact on the \nlevel of sugar in your blood. \n \nThe following medicines can increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact. This can lead to \na risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar):  \n- gemfibrozil and fibrates (to lower high cholesterol level) \n- insulin, metformin or other medicines to treat diabetes mellitus  \n- phenylbutazone, azapropazone, oxyphenbutazone, aspirin-like medicines (to treat pain and \n\ninflammation) \n- long acting sulphonamides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, fluconazole, miconazole, \n\nquinolones, clarithromycin (to treat bacterial or fungal infections) \n\n\n\n36 \n\n- anabolic steroids (supporting muscle build up) or male sex hormone replacement therapy  \n- fluoxetine, MAO-inhibitors (to treat depression) \n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sympatholytics, disopyramide, pentoxifylline, \n\ncoumarin derivatives such as warfarin (to treat heart or blood problems) \n- allopurinol, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone (to treat gout) \n- cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, trofosfamide (to treat cancer) \n- fenfluramine (to reduce weight) \n- tritoqualine (to treat allergies) \n \nThe following medicines may decrease the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact. This can lead to \na risk of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar level): \n- oestrogens, progestogens (female sex hormones) \n- thiazide diuretics and saluretics also called water tablets (to treat high blood pressure) \n- levothyroxine (to stimulate the thyroid gland) \n- glucocorticoids (to treat allergies and inflammation)  \n- chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine derivatives (to treat severe mental disorders) \n- adrenaline and sympathicomimetics (to increase heart beat, to treat asthma or nasal congestion, \n\ncoughs and colds or used in life-threatening emergencies)  \n- nicotinic acid (to treat high cholesterol level)  \n- long-term use of laxatives (to treat constipation) \n- phenytoin (to treat fits) \n- barbiturates (to treat nervousness and sleep problems) \n- azetazolamide (to treat increased pressure in the eye also called glaucoma) \n- diazoxide (to treat high blood pressure or low blood sugar) \n- rifampicin (to treat infections, tuberculosis) \n- glucagon (to treat severe low blood sugar levels) \n \nThe following medicines can increase or decrease the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact: \n- H2 antagonists (to treat stomach ulcers) \n- beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine (to treat high blood pressure or heart \n\nfailure). These can also hide the signs of hypoglycaemia, so special care is needed when taking \nthese medicines  \n\n \nTandemact may either increase or weaken the effects of the following medicines:  \n- coumarin derivatives such as warfarin (to slow down or stop blood clotting)  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and \nyour dose of Tandemact may need to be changed. \n \nTandemact with alcohol \nAvoid alcohol while taking Tandemact since alcohol may increase or decrease the blood sugar \nlowering action of Tandemact in an unpredictable way. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Tandemact if you are pregnant. You must tell your doctor if you are, you think you may be \npregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. \nDo not use Tandemact if you are breastfeeding or are planning to breast-feed (see section “Do not take \nTandemact”). \n \nDriving and using machines \nAlertness and reaction time may be impaired due to low or high blood sugar due to glimepiride, \nespecially when beginning or after altering treatment, or when Tandemact is not taken regularly. This \nmay affect your ability to drive or use machines.  \nTake care if you experience abnormal vision. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nTandemact contains lactose monohydrate \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking Tandemact.  \n \n \n3. How to take Tandemact \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet taken once daily shortly before or with the first main meal. Your \ndoctor will tell you the dose to take or if necessary to change to a different dose. You should swallow \nthe tablets with a glass of water. \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of Tandemact is too weak, talk to your doctor. \n \nIf you are following a special diet for diabetes, you should continue with this while you are taking \nTandemact. \n \nYour weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. \n \nYour doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with Tandemact. \n \nIf you take more Tandemact than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a \ndoctor or pharmacist immediately. Your blood sugar could fall below the normal level. The symptoms \nmay include cold sweat, tiredness, headache, rapid heartbeat, hunger pangs, irritability, nervousness, \nnausea, coma or convulsion. Your blood sugar level can be increased by taking sugar. It is \nrecommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. \n \nIf you forget to take Tandemact \nTake Tandemact daily as prescribed. However if you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and just carry \non with the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  \n \nIf you stop taking Tandemact \nTandemact should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using Tandemact, your blood sugar \nmay go up. Talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn particular, patients have experienced the following serious side effects: \n \nBladder cancer has been experienced uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) in patients \ntaking Tandemact. Signs and symptoms include blood in your urine, pain when urinating or a sudden \nneed to urinate. If you experience any of these, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) has been reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nin patients taking Tandemact. The symptoms may include cold sweat, tiredness, headache, rapid \nheartbeat, hunger pangs, irritability, nervousness or nausea.
