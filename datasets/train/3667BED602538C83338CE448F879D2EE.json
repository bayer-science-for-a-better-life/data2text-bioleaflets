NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nNoxafil 40 mg/mL oral suspension\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL of oral suspension contains 40 mg of posaconazole.\n\nExcipient with known effect:\nThis medicinal product contains approximately 1.75 g of glucose per 5 mL of suspension. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral suspension\n\nWhite suspension\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nNoxafil oral suspension is indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections in \nadults (see section 5.1):\n- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or \n\nitraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;\n- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are \n\nintolerant of amphotericin B;\n- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole \n\nor in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole;\n- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole \n\nor fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;\n- Oropharyngeal candidiasis: as first-line therapy in patients who have severe disease or are \n\nimmunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to be poor.\n\nRefractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days \nof prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy.\n\nNoxafil oral suspension is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following \npatients:\n- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) \n\nor myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are \nat high risk of developing invasive fungal infections; \n\n- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose\nimmunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing \ninvasive fungal infections.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nNon-Interchangeability between Noxafil Tablets and Noxafil Oral Suspension\n\nThe tablet and oral suspension are not to be used interchangeably due to the differences between these \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\ntwo formulations in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration \nachieved. Therefore, follow the specific dosage recommendations for each formulation.\n\nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in \nthe supportive care in the high risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.\n\nPosology\nNoxafil is also available as 100 mg gastro-resistant tablet and 300 mg concentrate for solution for \ninfusion. Noxafil tablets are the preferred formulation to optimize plasma concentrations and \ngenerally provide higher plasma drug exposures than Noxafil oral suspension.\n\nRecommended dose is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Recommended dose according to indication\nIndication Dose and duration of therapy\n\n(See section 5.2)\nRefractory invasive fungal \ninfections (IFI)/patients with IFI \nintolerant to 1st line therapy\n\n200 mg (5 mL) four times a day. Alternatively, patients who can \ntolerate food or a nutritional supplement may take 400 mg (10 mL) \ntwice a day during or immediately following a meal or nutritional \nsupplement.\nDuration of therapy should be based on the severity of the \nunderlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and \nclinical response.\n\nOropharyngeal candidiasis Loading dose of 200 mg (5 mL) once a day on the first day, then \n100 mg (2.5 mL) once a day for 13 days.\nEach dose of Noxafil should be administered during or \nimmediately after a meal, or a nutritional supplement in patients \nwho cannot tolerate food to enhance the oral absorption and to \nensure adequate exposure.\n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal \ninfections\n\n200 mg (5 mL) three times a day. Each dose of Noxafil should be \nadministered during or immediately after a meal, or a nutritional \nsupplement in patients who cannot tolerate food to enhance the \noral absorption and to ensure adequate exposure. The duration of \ntherapy is based on recovery from neutropenia or \nimmunosuppression. For patients with acute myelogenous \nleukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, prophylaxis with Noxafil \nshould start several days before the anticipated onset of \nneutropenia and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises \nabove 500 cells per mm3.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment \nAn effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose \nadjustment is recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nLimited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic \nliver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure \ncompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is \nnecessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for \nhigher plasma exposure.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Noxafil in children aged below 18 years have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nFor oral use\n\nThe oral suspension must be shaken well before use.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, \nhalofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity\nThere is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal \nagents. Caution should be used when prescribing Noxafil to patients with hypersensitivity to other \nazoles.\n\nHepatic toxicity\nHepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin \nand/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver \nfunction tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these \ntests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal \noutcomes have been reported. \nPosaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical \nexperience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nMonitoring of hepatic function\nLiver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy.\nPatients who develop abnormal liver function tests during Noxafil therapy must be routinely \nmonitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include \nlaboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). \nDiscontinuation of Noxafil should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with \ndevelopment of liver disease.\n\nQTc prolongation\nSome azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Noxafil must not be \nadministered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the \nQTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Noxafil should be administered with caution to patients with \npro-arrhythmic conditions such as:\n\uf0b7 Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation\n\uf0b7 Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n\uf0b7 Sinus bradycardia\n\uf0b7 Existing symptomatic arrhythmias\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those \n\nmentioned in section 4.3).\nElectrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should \nbe monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.\n\nDrug Interactions\nPosaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during \ntreatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).\n\nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines\nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of \nposaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, \nalprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).\n\nVincristine Toxicity\nConcomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been \nassociated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral \nneuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve \nazole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).\n\nRifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, primidone), efavirenz and cimetidine\nPosaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use \nwith posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nGastrointestinal dysfunction\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as \nsevere diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for \nbreakthrough fungal infections.\n\nExcipients\nThis medicinal product contains approximately 1.75 g of glucose per 5 mL of suspension. Patients \nwith glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on posaconazole\nPosaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for \np-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux in vitro. Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, \netc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, \nrespectively.\n\nRifabutin\nRifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area \nunder the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be \navoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the effect of \nposaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels. \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nEfavirenz\nEfavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to \nthe patient outweighs the risk. \n\nFosamprenavir\nCombining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma \nconcentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal \ninfections is recommended.  Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x \n10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the \n1st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21 % and 23 %, \nrespectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with \nritonavir is unknown.\n\nPhenytoin\nPhenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk.\n\nH2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors\nPosaconazole plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) were reduced by 39 % when posaconazole was \nadministered with cimetidine (400 mg twice a day) due to reduced absorption possibly secondary to a \ndecrease in gastric acid production. Co-administration of posaconazole with H2 receptor antagonists \nshould be avoided if possible. \nSimilarly, administration of 400 mg posaconazole with esomeprazole (40 mg daily) decreased mean \nCmax and AUC by 46 % and 32 %, respectively, compared to dosing with 400 mg posaconazole alone. \nCo-administration of posaconazole with proton pump inhibitors should be avoided if possible.\n\nFood\nThe absorption of posaconazole is significantly increased by food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nEffects of posaconazole on other medicinal products\nPosaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the \neffects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during co-\nadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of \nthe CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be \nassociated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate \nand/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the \ninteraction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole \noccurs compared to patients administered the same dose. The effect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 \nsubstrates in patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is \nexpected to be variable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The \neffect of co-administration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be \nvariable within a patient, unless posaconazole is administered in a strictly standardised way with food, \ngiven the large food effect on posaconazole exposure (see section 5.2).\n\nTerfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates)\nCo-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or \nquinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nErgot alkaloids\nPosaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and \ndihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot \nalkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and \natorvastatin)\nPosaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be \ndiscontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with \nrhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).\n\nVinca alkaloids\nMost of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant \nadministration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with \nserious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of \nvinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, \nreserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.\n\nRifabutin\nPosaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. Concomitant \nuse of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the \nrisk (see also above regarding the effect of rifabutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these \nmedicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions\nrelated to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.\n\nSirolimus\nRepeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-fold and 8.9-fold (range \n3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The effect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients \nis unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Co-\nadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever \npossible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the \ndose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that \nthere should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. \nSirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at \ndiscontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly. It should be \nnoted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-\nadministration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the \nusual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore trough concentrations that fall \nin the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid \nto clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies.\n\nCiclosporin\nIn heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once \ndaily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin \nlevels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of \nleukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with \nposaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. \nto about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be \nmonitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, \nand the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nTacrolimus\nPosaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % \nand 358 %, respectively. Clinically significant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or \nposaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating posaconazole \ntreatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to \nabout one third of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored \ncarefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of \ntacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.\n\nHIV Protease inhibitors\nAs HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase \nplasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral \nsuspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects \nCmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), \nrespectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with \natazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of \natazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The \naddition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated \nwith increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity \nrelated to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during co-\nadministration with posaconazole.\n\nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4\nIn a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) \nincreased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in \nhealthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily \nfor 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average \nof 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice \ndaily for 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to \n7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg \nsingle oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg \nor 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to \n8-10 hours during co-administration.\nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered \nwhen posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by \nCYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).\n\nCalcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, \nnisoldipine)\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is \nrecommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel \nblockers may be required.\n\nDigoxin\nAdministration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, \nposaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored \nwhen initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.\n\nSulfonylureas\nGlucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered \nwith posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere is insufficient information on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole \nmust not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential \nrisk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nPosaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of \nposaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with posaconazole.\n\nFertility\nPosaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (1.7 times the 400-mg \ntwice daily regimen based on steady-state plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers) or female rats \nat a dose up to 45 mg/kg (2.2 times the 400-mg twice daily regimen). There is no clinical experience \nassessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSince certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with \nposaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be \nused.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in > 2,400 patients and healthy \nvolunteers enrolled in clinical trials and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently \nreported serious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and \nincreased bilirubin.\nThe safety of posaconazole tablet has been assessed in 336 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in \nclinical trials. The safety profile of tablets was similar to that of the oral suspension.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 2.

No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.\n\nPosaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of \noverdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC04.\n\nMechanism of action\nPosaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential \nstep in ergosterol biosynthesis.\n\nMicrobiology\nPosaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the following microorganisms: Aspergillus\nspecies (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ustus), Candida species \n(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, \nC. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis), Coccidioides immitis, Fonsecaea \npedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus. The microbiological data \nsuggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus; however the clinical \ndata are currently too limited to assess the efficacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.\n\nResistance\nClinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle \nmechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.\n\nEpidemiological Cut-off (ECOFF) Values for Aspergillus spp.\nThe ECOFF values for posaconazole, which distinguish the wild type population from isolates with \nacquired resistance, have been determined by EUCAST methodology.\n\nEUCAST ECOFF values:\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus flavus: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus fumigatus: 0.25 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus nidulans: 0.5 mg/L \n\uf0b7 Aspergillus niger: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus terreus: 0.25 mg/L \n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for Aspergillus spp. ECOFF values do \nnot equate to clinical breakpoints.\n\nBreakpoints\nEUCAST MIC breakpoints for posaconazole [susceptible (S); resistant (R)]:\n\uf0b7 Candida albicans: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Candida tropicalis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Candida parapsilosis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Candida species.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nCombination with other antifungal agents\nThe use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole \nor the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will \nprovide an added benefit.\n\nPharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships\nA correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical \noutcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is \nparticularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected \nwith Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens and the effects of food on \nabsorption).\n\nClinical experience\n\nSummary of posaconazole oral suspension studies\n\nInvasive aspergillosis\nOral posaconazole suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of \ninvasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal \nformulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a non-\ncomparative salvage therapy trial (Study 0041). Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an \nexternal control group derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control \ngroup included 86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the \nsame sites as the patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were \nconsidered to be refractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external \ncontrol group (79 %).\n\nAs shown in Table 3, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment \nwas seen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, \nthis was not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external \ncontrol group should be viewed with caution.\n\nTable 3.

Among \neighteen patients who were intolerant or had infections refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, \nseven patients were classed as responders.\n\n                                                     \n1 Includes other less common species or species unknown\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nChromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma\n9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis \ndue to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species.\n\nCoccidioidomycosis\n11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of \nsigns and symptoms present at baseline) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days.\n\nTreatment of azole-susceptible Oropharyngeal Candidiasis (OPC)\nA randomised, evaluator-blind, controlled study was completed in HIV-infected patients with azole-\nsusceptible oropharyngeal candidiasis (most patients studied had C. albicans isolated at baseline). The \nprimary efficacy variable was the clinical success rate (defined as cure or improvement) after 14 days \nof treatment. Patients were treated with posaconazole or fluconazole oral suspension (both \nposaconazole and fluconazole were given as follows: 100 mg twice a day for 1 day followed by \n100 mg once a day for 13 days).\n\nThe clinical response rates from the above study are shown in the Table 4 below.\nPosaconazole was shown to be non-inferior to fluconazole for clinical success rates at Day 14 as well \nas 4 weeks after the end of treatment.\n\nTable 4. Clinical success rates in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis\nEndpoint Posaconazole Fluconazole\nClinical success rate at Day 14 91.7 % (155/169) 92.5 % (148/160)\n\nClinical success rate 4 weeks after end of treatment 68.5 % (98/143) 61.8 % (84/136)\nClinical success rate was defined as the number of cases assessed as having a clinical response (cure or improvement) divided\nby the total number of cases eligible for analysis.\n\nProphylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899)\nTwo randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high risk for \ndeveloping invasive fungal infections.\n\nStudy 316 was a randomised, double-blind trial of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times \na day) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomisation as determined by an independent, \nblinded external expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nduring the on-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The \nmajority (377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive \n(195/600, [32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole \nand 77 days for fluconazole.\n\nStudy 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three \ntimes a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg \ntwice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute \nmyelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel \nduring the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nat 100 days post-randomisation. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most \ncommon underlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for \nposaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole.\n\nIn both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 5 \nand 6 for results from both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients \nreceiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients.\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nTable 5.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the \nprobability of survival up to day 100 after randomisation, was significantly higher for posaconazole \nrecipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death \n(P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209).\n\nIn Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFI-\nrelated deaths was significantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU \ngroup (12/299; P= 0.0413).\n\nPaediatric population\nSixteen patients 8-17 years of age were treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in a \nstudy for invasive fungal infections (Study 0041). Based on the available data in 16 of these paediatric \npatients, the safety profile appears to be similar to patients \u2265 18 years of age.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nAdditionally, twelve patients 13-17 years of age received posaconazole oral suspension 600 mg/day \nfor prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (Studies 316 and 1899). The safety profile in these \npatients < 18 years of age appears similar to the safety profile observed in adults. Based on \npharmacokinetic data in 10 of these paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic profile appears to be \nsimilar to patients \u2265 18 years of age. In a study (Study 03579) of 136 neutropenic paediatric patients \n11 months \u2013 17 years treated with posaconazole oral suspension at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day divided \nTID, approximately 50% met the pre-specified target (Day 7 Cav between 500 ng/mL-2,500 ng/mL) \n(see section 5.2).\n\nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.\n\nElectrocardiogram evaluation\nMultiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during \nadministration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from \n173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the \nmean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption \nPosaconazole is absorbed with a median tmax of 3 hours (fed patients). The pharmacokinetics of \nposaconazole are linear following single and multiple dose administration of up to 800 mg when taken \nwith a high fat meal. No further increases in exposure were observed when doses above 800 mg daily \nwere administered to patients and healthy volunteers. In the fasting state, AUC increased less than in \nproportion to dose above 200 mg. In healthy volunteers under fasting conditions, dividing the total \ndaily dose (800 mg) into 200 mg four times daily compared to 400 mg twice daily, was shown to \nincrease posaconazole exposure by 2.6-fold.\n\nEffect of food on oral absorption in healthy volunteers\nThe absorption of posaconazole was significantly increased when posaconazole 400 mg (once daily) \nwas administered during and immediately after the consumption of a high fat meal (~ 50 grams fat) \ncompared to administration before a meal, with Cmax and AUC increasing by approximately 330 % \nand 360 %, respectively. The AUC of posaconazole is: 4 times greater when administered with a high-\nfat meal (~ 50 grams fat) and about 2.6 times greater when administered during a non-fat meal or \nnutritional supplement (14 grams fat) relative to the fasted state (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nDistribution\nPosaconazole is slowly absorbed and slowly eliminated with a large apparent volume of distribution \n(1,774 litres) and is highly protein bound (> 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.\n\nBiotransformation\nPosaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to \nbe altered by inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are \nglucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) \nmetabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % \nof the administered radiolabelled dose.\n\nElimination\nPosaconazole is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life (t\u00bd) of 35 hours (range 20 to 66 hours). After \nadministration of 14C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of \nthe radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled \ndose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the radiolabelled dose excreted \nin urine (< 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state is attained following \n7 to 10 days of multiple-dose administration.\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nChildren (< 18 years)\nFollowing administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole as a divided dose for treatment of \ninvasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients 8 - 17 years of age \n(776 ng/mL) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18 - 64 years of age (817 ng/mL). \nSimilarly, in the prophylaxis studies, the mean steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) \nwas comparable among ten adolescents (13-17 years of age) to Cav achieved in adults (\u2265 18 years of \nage). In a study of 136 neutropenic paediatric patients 11 months \u2013 17 years treated with posaconazole \noral suspension at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day divided TID, approximately 50% met the pre-specified \ntarget (Day 7 Cav between 500 ng/mL-2,500 ng/mL). In general, exposures tended to be higher in the \nolder patients (7 to <18 years) than in younger patients (2 to <7 years). \n\nGender\nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are comparable in men and women.\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 65 years)\nAn increase in Cmax (26 %) and AUC (29 %) was observed in elderly subjects (24 subjects \uf0b3 65 years \nof age) relative to younger subjects (24 subjects 18 - 45 years of age). However, in clinical efficacy \ntrials, the safety profile of posaconazole between the young and elderly patients was similar.\n\nRace\nThere was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black \nsubjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety profile of posaconazole between the \nBlack and Caucasian subjects was similar.\n\nWeight\nPharmacokinetic modelling with an oral tablet formulation suggests that patients weighing greater \nthan 120 kg may have lower posaconazole exposure. It is, therefore, suggested to closely monitor for \nbreakthrough fungal infections in patients weighing more than 120 kg. Patients with a low body \nweight (< 60 kg) are more likely to experience higher plasma concentrations of posaconazole and \nshould be closely monitored for adverse events.\n\nRenal impairment\nFollowing single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild \nand moderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr \u2265 20 mL/min/1.73 m\n\n2) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; \ntherefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr\n< 20 mL/min/1.73 m2), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [> 96 % CV (coefficient of \nvariance)] compared to other renal groups [< 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not \nsignificantly renally eliminated, an effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nposaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed \nby haemodialysis.\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfter a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per \ngroup), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that \nthere is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60 % increase in total \nAUC. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in \nrespective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic \nimpairment but caution is advised due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAs observed with other azole antifungal agents, effects related to inhibition of steroid hormone \nsynthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects \n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nwere observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained \nat therapeutic doses in humans. \n\nNeuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for \uf0b3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than \nthose obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one \nyear. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed \non the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved \ntherapeutically.\n\nPulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the \n2-year study in rats. These findings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for functional changes \nin humans.\n\nNo effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety \npharmacology study in monkeys at systemic exposures 4.6-fold greater than the concentrations \nobtained at therapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac \ndecompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 1.4-fold \ngreater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to \n29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 1.4-fold and 4.6-fold greater, \nrespectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses.\n\nReproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower \nthan those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and \nmalformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal \nviability. In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at \ntherapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were \nconsidered to be due to a treatment-related effect on steroidogenesis.\n\nPosaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal \nspecial hazards for humans.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nNoxafil 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 100 mg of posaconazole.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nGastro-resistant tablet (tablet)\nYellow-coated, capsule-shaped tablet of 17.5 mm length debossed with \u201c100\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nNoxafil gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections \nin adults (see section 5.1):\n- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or \n\nitraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;\n- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are \n\nintolerant of amphotericin B;\n- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole \n\nor in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole;\n- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole \n\nor fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products.\n\nRefractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days \nof prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy.\n\nNoxafil gastro-resistant tablets are also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the \nfollowing patients:\n- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) \n\nor myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are \nat high risk of developing invasive fungal infections; \n\n- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose \nimmunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing \ninvasive fungal infections.\n\nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of Noxafil oral suspension for use in \noropharyngeal candidiasis.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nNon-Interchangeability between Noxafil Tablets and Noxafil Oral Suspension\n\nThe tablet and oral suspension are not to be used interchangeably due to the differences between these \ntwo formulations in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration \nachieved. Therefore, follow the specific dosage recommendations for each formulation.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in \nthe supportive care in the high risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.\n\nPosology\nNoxafil is also available as 40 mg/mL oral suspension and 300 mg concentrate for solution for \ninfusion. Noxafil tablets are the preferred formulation to optimize plasma concentrations and \ngenerally provide higher plasma drug exposures than Noxafil oral suspension.\n\nRecommended dose is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Recommended dose according to indication\nIndication Dose and duration of therapy\n\n(See section 5.2)\nRefractory invasive fungal \ninfections (IFI)/patients with IFI \nintolerant to 1st line therapy\n\nLoading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day on the \nfirst day, then 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) once a day thereafter. \nEach dose may be taken without regard to food intake. Duration of \ntherapy should be based on the severity of the underlying disease, \nrecovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response. \n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal \ninfections\n\nLoading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day on the \nfirst day, then 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) once a day thereafter. \nEach dose may be taken without regard to food intake. Duration of \ntherapy is based on recovery from neutropenia or \nimmunosuppression. For patients with acute myelogenous \nleukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, prophylaxis with Noxafil \nshould start several days before the anticipated onset of \nneutropenia and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises \nabove 500 cells per mm3.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment \nAn effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose \nadjustment is recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment \nLimited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic \nliver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure \ncompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is \nnecessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for \nhigher plasma exposure.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Noxafil in children aged below 18 years have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made.\n\nNo data are available for the tablet formulation.\n\nMethod of administration\nFor oral use\n\nNoxafil gastro-resistant tablets may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets should \nbe swallowed whole with water and should not be crushed, chewed, or broken.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, \nhalofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity\nThere is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal \nagents. Caution should be used when prescribing Noxafil to patients with hypersensitivity to other \nazoles.\n\nHepatic toxicity\nHepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin \nand/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver \nfunction tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these \ntests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal \noutcomes have been reported. \nPosaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical \nexperience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nMonitoring of hepatic function\nLiver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. \nPatients who develop abnormal liver function tests during Noxafil therapy must be routinely \nmonitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include \nlaboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). \nDiscontinuation of Noxafil should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with \ndevelopment of liver disease.\n\nQTc prolongation\nSome azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Noxafil must not be \nadministered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the \nQTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Noxafil should be administered with caution to patients with \npro-arrhythmic conditions such as:\n\uf0b7 Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation\n\uf0b7 Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure\n\uf0b7 Sinus bradycardia\n\uf0b7 Existing symptomatic arrhythmias\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those \n\nmentioned in section 4.3).\nElectrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should \nbe monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nDrug Interactions\nPosaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during \ntreatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).\n\nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines\nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of \nposaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, \nalprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).\n\nVincristine Toxicity\nConcomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been \nassociated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral \nneuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve \nazole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).\n\nRifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, primidone), and efavirenz.\nPosaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use \nwith posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nPlasma exposure\nPosaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets are generally \nhigher than those obtained with posaconazole oral suspension. Posaconazole plasma concentrations \nfollowing administration of posaconazole tablets may increase over time in some patients (see \nsection 5.2). Safety data at higher exposure levels achieved with posaconazole tablets are at present \nlimited.\n\nGastrointestinal dysfunction\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as \nsevere diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for \nbreakthrough fungal infections.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on posaconazole\nPosaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for \np-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux in vitro. Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, \netc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, \nrespectively.\n\nRifabutin\nRifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area \nunder the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be \navoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the effect of \nposaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels. \n\nEfavirenz\nEfavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to \nthe patient outweighs the risk. \n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nFosamprenavir\nCombining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma \nconcentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal \ninfections is recommended.  Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x \n10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the \n1st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21 % and 23 %, \nrespectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with \nritonavir is unknown.\n\nPhenytoin\nPhenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk.\n\nH2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors\nNo clinically relevant effects were observed when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with \nantacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. No dosage adjustment of posaconazole \ntablets is required when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H2-receptor \nantagonists and proton pump inhibitors.\n\nEffects of posaconazole on other medicinal products\nPosaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the \neffects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during co-\nadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of \nthe CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be \nassociated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate \nand/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the \ninteraction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole \noccurs compared to patients administered the same dose. The effect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 \nsubstrates in patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is \nexpected to be variable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The \neffect of co-administration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be \nvariable within a patient.\n\nTerfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates)\nCo-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or \nquinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nErgot alkaloids\nPosaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and \ndihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot \nalkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and \natorvastatin)\nPosaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be \ndiscontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with \nrhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).\n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nVinca alkaloids\nMost of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant \nadministration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with \nserious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of \nvinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, \nreserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.\n\nRifabutin\nPosaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. Concomitant \nuse of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the \nrisk (see also above regarding the effect of rifabutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these \nmedicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions \nrelated to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.\n\nSirolimus\nRepeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-fold and 8.9-fold (range \n3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The effect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients \nis unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Co-\nadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever \npossible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the \ndose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that \nthere should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. \nSirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at \ndiscontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly. It should be \nnoted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-\nadministration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the \nusual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore, trough concentrations that fall \nin the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid \nto clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies. \n\nCiclosporin\nIn heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once \ndaily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin \nlevels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of \nleukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with \nposaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. \nto about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be \nmonitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, \nand the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.\n\nTacrolimus\nPosaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % \nand 358 %, respectively. Clinically significant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or \nposaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating posaconazole \ntreatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to \nabout one third of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored \ncarefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of \ntacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.\n\nHIV Protease inhibitors\nAs HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase \nplasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral \nsuspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects \nCmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), \n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nrespectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with \natazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of \natazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The \naddition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated \nwith increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity \nrelated to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during co-\nadministration with posaconazole.\n\nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4\nIn a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) \nincreased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in \nhealthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily \nfor 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average \nof 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice \ndaily for 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to \n7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg \nsingle oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg \nor 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to \n8-10 hours during co-administration.\nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered \nwhen posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by \nCYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).\n\nCalcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, \nnisoldipine)\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is \nrecommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel \nblockers may be required.\n\nDigoxin\nAdministration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, \nposaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored \nwhen initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.\n\nSulfonylureas\nGlucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered \nwith posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere is insufficient information on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole \nmust not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential \nrisk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nPosaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of \nposaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with posaconazole.\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nFertility\nPosaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (3.4 times the 300-mg \ntablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg \n(2.6 times the 300-mg tablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients). There is no \nclinical experience assessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSince certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with\nposaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be \nused.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSafety data mainly derive from studies with the oral suspension.\n\nThe tablet formulation was investigated in AML and MDS patients and those after HSCT with or at \nrisk for Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) only. Maximum duration of exposure to the tablet \nformulation was shorter than with the oral suspension. Plasma exposure resulting from the tablet \nformulation was higher than observed with the oral suspension. A higher incidence of adverse \nreactions cannot be ruled out.\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nPosaconazole tablets \nThe safety of posaconazole tablets has been assessed in 230 patients enrolled in the pivotal clinical \nstudy. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of posaconazole \ntablets when given as antifungal prophylaxis. Patients were immunocompromised with underlying \nconditions including haematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, GVHD, and post \nHSCT. Posaconazole therapy was given for a median duration of 28 days. Twenty patients received \n200 mg daily dose and 210 patients received 300 mg daily dose (following twice daily dosing on Day \n1 in each cohort).\n\nPosaconazole tablet and oral suspension safety\nThe safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in > 2,400 patients and healthy \nvolunteers enrolled in clinical trials and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently \nreported serious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and \nincreased bilirubin.\nThe safety of posaconazole tablet has been assessed in 336 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in \nclinical trials. The safety profile of tablets was similar to that of the oral suspension.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nTable 2.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no experience with overdose of posaconazole tablets.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day \nexperienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. \nAccidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice \na day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.\n\nPosaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of \noverdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC04.\n\nMechanism of action\nPosaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential \nstep in ergosterol biosynthesis.\n\nMicrobiology\nPosaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the following microorganisms: Aspergillus\nspecies (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ustus), Candida species \n(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, \nC. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis), Coccidioides immitis, Fonsecaea \npedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus. The microbiological data \nsuggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus; however the clinical \ndata are currently too limited to assess the efficacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.\n\nResistance\nClinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle \nmechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.\n\nEpidemiological Cut-off (ECOFF) Values for Aspergillus spp.\nThe ECOFF values for posaconazole, which distinguish the wild type population from isolates with \nacquired resistance, have been determined by EUCAST methodology.\n\nEUCAST ECOFF values:\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus flavus: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus fumigatus: 0.25 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus nidulans: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus niger: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus terreus: 0.25 mg/L\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for Aspergillus spp. ECOFF values do \nnot equate to clinical breakpoints.\n\nBreakpoints\nEUCAST MIC breakpoints for posaconazole [susceptible (S); resistant (R)]:\n\uf0b7 Candida albicans: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Candida tropicalis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Candida parapsilosis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Candida species.\n\nCombination with other antifungal agents\nThe use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole \nor the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will \nprovide an added benefit.\n\nClinical experience\n\nSummary of posaconazole tablet bridging study\nStudy 5615 was a non-comparative multi-center study performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic \nproperties, safety, and tolerability of posaconazole tablet.  Study 5615 was conducted in a similar \npatient population to that previously studied in the pivotal posaconazole oral suspension clinical \nprogram. The pharmacokinetics and safety data from Study 5615 were bridged to the existing data \n(including efficacy data) with the oral suspension. \n\nThe subject population included: 1) patients with AML or MDS who had recently received \nchemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia, or 2) patients \nwho had undergone a HSCT and were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prevention or \ntreatment of GVHD. Two different dosing groups were evaluated: 200 mg twice daily on Day 1, \nfollowed by 200 mg once daily thereafter (Part IA) and 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by \n300 mg once daily thereafter (Part 1B and Part 2).\n\nSerial PK samples were collected on Day 1 and at steady-state on Day 8 for all Part 1 subjects and a \nsubset of Part 2 subjects. Moreover, sparse PK samples were collected at several days during steady \nstate before the next dose (Cmin) for a larger subject population. Based on average Cmin concentrations, \na predicted average concentration (Cav) could be calculated for 186 subjects dosed with 300 mg. PK \nanalysis in patients of Cav found that 81 % of the subjects treated with the 300 mg once daily dose \nattained steady state predicted Cav between 500-2,500 ng/mL. One subject (<1 %) had a predicted \nCav below 500 ng/mL and 19 % of the subjects had a predicted Cav above 2,500 ng/mL. Subjects \nachieved a mean predicted Cav at steady state of 1,970 ng/mL.\n\nIn Table 3 a comparison is shown of exposure (Cav) after administration of posaconazole tablet and \nposaconazole oral suspension at therapeutic doses in patients depicted as quartile analysis. Exposures \nafter tablet administration are generally higher than, but overlapping with, exposures after \nadministration of posaconazole oral suspension.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nTable 3.

Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an \nexternal control group derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control \ngroup included 86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the \nsame sites as the patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were \nconsidered to be refractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external \ncontrol group (79 %).\nAs shown in Table 4, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment \nwas seen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, \nthis was not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external \ncontrol group should be viewed with caution.\n\nTable 4.

Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis \ndue to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species.\n\nCoccidioidomycosis\n11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of \nsigns and symptoms present at baseline) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days.\n\nProphylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899)\nTwo randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high risk for \ndeveloping invasive fungal infections.\n\nStudy 316 was a randomised, double-blind trial of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times \na day) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomisation as determined by an independent, \nblinded external expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nduring the on-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The \nmajority (377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive \n(195/600, [32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole \nand 77 days for fluconazole.\n\nStudy 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three \ntimes a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg \ntwice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute \nmyelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel \nduring the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nat 100 days post-randomisation. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most \ncommon underlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for \nposaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole.\n\nIn both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 5 \nand 6 for results from both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients \nreceiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients.\n\nTable 5.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the \nprobability of survival up to day 100 after randomisation, was significantly higher for posaconazole \nrecipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death \n(P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209).\n\nIn Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFI-\nrelated deaths was significantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU \ngroup (12/299; P= 0.0413).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no paediatric experience for posaconazole tablets.\n\nSixteen patients 8-17 years of age were treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in a \nstudy for invasive fungal infections. Based on the available data in 16 of these paediatric patients, the \nsafety profile appears to be similar to patients \u2265 18 years of age.\n\nAdditionally, twelve patients 13-17 years of age received posaconazole oral suspension 600 mg/day \nfor prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (Studies 316 and 1899). The safety profile in these \npatients < 18 years of age appears similar to the safety profile observed in adults. Based on \npharmacokinetic data in 10 of these paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic profile appears to be \nsimilar to patients \u2265 18 years of age.\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.\n\nElectrocardiogram evaluation\nMultiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during \nadministration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from \n173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the \nmean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships\nA correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical \noutcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is \nparticularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected \nwith Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens).\n\nAbsorption\nPosaconazole tablets are absorbed with a median Tmax of 4 to 5 hours and exhibits dose proportional \npharmacokinetics after single and multiple dosing up to 300 mg. \n\nFollowing a single dose administration of 300 mg posaconazole tablets after a high fat meal to healthy \nvolunteers, the AUC0-72 hours and Cmax were higher compared to administration under fasted condition \n(51 % and 16 % for AUC0-72 hours and Cmax respectively).\n\nPosaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets may increase \nover time in some patients. The reason for this time-dependency is not completely understood.\n\nDistribution\nPosaconazole, after administration of the tablet, has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 394 L \n(42 %), ranging between 294-583 L among the studies in healthy volunteers.\n\nPosaconazole is highly protein bound (> 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.\n\nBiotransformation\nPosaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to \nbe altered by inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are \nglucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) \nmetabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % \nof the administered radiolabelled dose.\n\nElimination\nPosaconazole after administration of the tablets, is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life (t\u00bd) of \n29 hours (range 26 to 31 hours) and a mean apparent clearance ranging from 7.5 to 11 L/hr. After \nadministration of 14C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of \nthe radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled \ndose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the radiolabelled dose excreted \nin urine (< 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state plasma concentrations \nare attained by Day 6 at the 300 mg dose (once daily after twice daily loading dose at Day 1).\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nChildren (< 18 years)\nThere is no paediatric experience with posaconazole tablets.\nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole oral suspension have been evaluated in paediatric patients. \nFollowing administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole oral suspension as a divided dose for \ntreatment of invasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients 8 -\n17 years of age (776 ng/mL) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18 - 64 years of age \n\n \n\n\n\n36\n\n(817 ng/mL). No pharmacokinetic data are available from paediatric patients less than 8 years of age. \nSimilarly, in the prophylaxis studies, the mean steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) \nwas comparable among ten adolescents (13-17 years of age) to Cav achieved in adults (\u2265 18 years of \nage).\n\nGender\nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets are comparable in men and women.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets are comparable in young and elderly subjects. No \noverall differences in safety were observed between the geriatric patients and younger patients; \ntherefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for geriatric patients.\n\nRace\nThere is insufficient data among different races with posaconazole tablets.\n\nThere was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black \nsubjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety profile of posaconazole between the \nBlack and Caucasian subjects was similar.\n\nWeight\nPharmacokinetic modelling with an oral tablet formulation suggests that patients weighing greater \nthan 120 kg may have lower posaconazole exposure. It is, therefore, suggested to closely monitor for \nbreakthrough fungal infections in patients weighing more than 120 kg.\n\nPatients, in particular those receiving posaconazole after HSCT, who have a low body weight \n(< 60 kg) are more likely to experience higher plasma concentrations of posaconazole and should be \nclosely monitored for adverse events.\n\nRenal impairment\nFollowing single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild \nand moderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr \u2265 20 mL/min/1.73 m\n\n2) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; \ntherefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr\n< 20 mL/min/1.73 m2), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [> 96 % CV (coefficient of \nvariance)] compared to other renal groups [< 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not \nsignificantly renally eliminated, an effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nposaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed \nby haemodialysis.\n\nSimilar recommendations apply to posaconazole tablets; however, a specific study has not been \nconducted with the posaconazole tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfter a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per \ngroup), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that \nthere is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60 % increase in total \nAUC. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in \nrespective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic \nimpairment but caution is advised due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.\n\nSimilar recommendations apply to posaconazole tablets; however, a specific study has not been \nconducted with the posaconazole tablets.\n\n \n\n\n\n37\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAs observed with other azole antifungal agents, effects related to inhibition of steroid hormone \nsynthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects \nwere observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained \nat therapeutic doses in humans. \n\nNeuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for \uf0b3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than \nthose obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one \nyear. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed \non the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved \ntherapeutically.\n\nPulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the \n2-year study in rats. These findings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for functional changes \nin humans.\n\nNo effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety \npharmacology study in monkeys at maximal plasma concentrations 8.5-fold greater than the \nconcentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of \ncardiac decompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure \n2.1-fold greater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up \nto 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 2.1-fold and 8.5-fold greater, \nrespectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses.\n\nReproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower \nthan those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and \nmalformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal \nviability. In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at \ntherapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were \nconsidered to be due to a treatment-related effect on steroidogenesis.\n\nPosaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal \nspecial hazards for humans.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion.\nClear, colourless to yellow liquid. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion is indicated for use in the treatment of the following \nfungal infections in adults (see section 5.1):\n- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or \n\nitraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;\n- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are \n\nintolerant of amphotericin B;\n- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole \n\nor in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole;\n- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole \n\nor fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products.\n\nRefractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days \nof prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy.\n\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal \ninfections in the following patients:\n\n- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) \nor myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are \nat high risk of developing invasive fungal infections; \n\n- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose \nimmunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease (GVHD) and who are at high risk of \ndeveloping invasive fungal infections.\n\nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of Noxafil oral suspension for use in \noropharyngeal candidiasis.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in \nthe supportive care in the high risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.\n\nPosology\nNoxafil is also available for oral administration (Noxafil 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets and \n40 mg/mL oral suspension). A switch to oral administration is recommended as soon as the patients\u2019 \ncondition allows (see section 4.4).\n\nRecommended dose is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Recommended dose according to indication\nIndication Dose and duration of therapy\n\n(See section 5.2)\nRefractory invasive fungal \ninfections (IFI)/patients with IFI \nintolerant to 1st line therapy\n\nLoading dose of 300 mg Noxafil twice a day on the first day, then \n300 mg once a day thereafter. Duration of therapy should be based \non the severity of the underlying disease, recovery from \nimmunosuppression, and clinical response. \n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal \ninfections\n\nLoading dose of 300 mg Noxafil twice a day on the first day, then \n300 mg once a day thereafter. Duration of therapy is based on \nrecovery from neutropenia or immunosuppression. For patients \nwith AML or MDS, prophylaxis with Noxafil should start several \ndays before the anticipated onset of neutropenia and continue for \n7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 500 cells per mm3.\n\nNoxafil should be administered via a central venous line, including a central venous catheter or \nperipherally inserted central catheter (PICC) by slow intravenous infusion over approximately \n90 minutes. Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion should not be given by bolus administration. \nIf a central venous catheter is not available, a single infusion may be administered through a \nperipheral venous catheter. When administered through a peripheral venous catheter, the infusion \nshould be administered over approximately 30 minutes (see section 4.8 and 6.6).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), \naccumulation of the intravenous vehicle, Betadex Sulfobutyl Ether Sodium (SBECD), is expected to \noccur. Oral formulations of Noxafil should be used in these patients unless an assessment of the \nbenefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion. Serum \ncreatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nLimited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic \nliver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure \ncompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is \nnecessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for \nhigher plasma exposure.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion in children aged below \n18 years have not been established.\nNo data are available.\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion should not be used in children aged below 18 years \nbecause of pre-clinical safety concerns (see section 5.3).\n\nMethod of administration\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion requires dilution (see section 6.6) prior to administration.  \nNoxafil should be administered via a central venous line, including a central venous catheter or \nperipherally inserted central catheter (PICC) by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately \n90 minutes (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8).\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion should not be given by bolus administration.\n\nIf a central venous catheter is not available, a single infusion may be administered through a \nperipheral venous catheter. When administered through a peripheral venous catheter, the infusion \nshould be administered over approximately 30 minutes to reduce the likelihood of infusion site \nreactions (see section 4.8).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, \nhalofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity\nThere is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal \nagents. Caution should be used when prescribing Noxafil to patients with hypersensitivity to other \nazoles.\n\nHepatic toxicity\nHepatic reactions (e.g. elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and/or clinical \nhepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver function tests were \ngenerally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these tests normalised \nwithout interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal outcomes have been \nreported. \n\nPosaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical \nexperience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nMonitoring of patients with severe renal impairment\nDue to the variability in exposure, patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely \nfor breakthrough fungal infections (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nMonitoring of hepatic function\nLiver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. \nPatients who develop abnormal liver function tests during Noxafil therapy must be routinely \nmonitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include \nlaboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). \n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\nDiscontinuation of Noxafil should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with \ndevelopment of liver disease.\n\nQTc prolongation\nSome azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Noxafil must not be \nadministered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the \nQTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Noxafil should be administered with caution to patients with \npro-arrhythmic conditions such as:\n\uf0b7 Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation\n\uf0b7 Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure\n\uf0b7 Sinus bradycardia\n\uf0b7 Existing symptomatic arrhythmias\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those \n\nmentioned in section 4.3).\nElectrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should \nbe monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.\nIn patients, mean maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) after posaconazole concentrate for solution \nfor infusion are 4-fold increased compared to administration of oral suspension. An increased effect \non the QTc interval cannot be ruled out. Particular caution is advised in such cases where \nposaconazole is administered peripherally, as the recommended infusion time of 30 minutes may \nfurther increase Cmax.\n\nDrug Interactions\nPosaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during \ntreatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).\n\nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines\nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of \nposaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, \nalprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).\n\nVincristine toxicity\nConcomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been \nassociated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral \nneuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve \nazole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).\n\nRifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, primidone), and efavirenz\nPosaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use \nwith posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nPlasma exposure\nPlasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole intravenous concentrate for solution \nfor infusion are generally higher than those obtained with posaconazole oral suspension. \nPosaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole may increase over time \nin some patients (see section 5.2). Safety data at higher exposure levels achieved with posaconazole \nconcentrate for solution for infusion are at present limited.\n\nThromboembolic events\nThromboembolic events have been identified as a potential risk for posaconazole intravenous \nconcentrate for solution for infusion but were not observed in the clinical studies. Thrombophlebitis \n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\nwas observed in clinical trials. Caution is warranted on any sign or symptom of thromboembolic \nevents (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).\n\nSodium content\nEach vial of Noxafil contains 462 mg (20 mmol) of sodium. This should be taken into consideration \nfor patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe following information was derived from data with posaconazole oral suspension or early tablet \nformulation. All drug interactions with posaconazole oral suspension, except for those that affect the \nabsorption of posaconazole (via gastric pH and motility) are considered relevant to posaconazole \nconcentrate for solution for infusion as well.\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on posaconazole\nPosaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for \np-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux in vitro. Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, \netc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, \nrespectively.\n\nRifabutin\nRifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area\nunder the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be \navoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the effect of \nposaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels. \n\nEfavirenz\nEfavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to \nthe patient outweighs the risk. \n\nFosamprenavir\nCombining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma \nconcentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal \ninfections is recommended. Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x \n10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the \n1st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21 % and 23 %, \nrespectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with \nritonavir is unknown.\n\nPhenytoin\nPhenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk.\n\nEffects of posaconazole on other medicinal products\nPosaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the \neffects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during co-\nadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of \nthe CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be \n\n \n\n\n\n44\n\nassociated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate \nand/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. \n\nTerfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates)\nCo-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or \nquinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nErgot alkaloids\nPosaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and \ndihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot \nalkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and \natorvastatin)\nPosaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be \ndiscontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with \nrhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).\n\nVinca alkaloids\nMost of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant \nadministration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with \nserious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of \nvinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, \nreserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.\n\nRifabutin\nAfter oral administration, posaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to \nthe patient outweighs the risk (see also above regarding the effect of rifabutin on plasma levels of \nposaconazole). If these medicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood \ncounts and adverse reactions related to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.\n\nSirolimus\nRepeat dose administration of oral posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-fold and 8.9-fold (range \n3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The effect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients \nis unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Co-\nadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever \npossible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the \ndose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that \nthere should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. \nSirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at \ndiscontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly. It should be \nnoted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-\nadministration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the\nusual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore trough concentrations that fall \nin the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid \nto clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies. \n\nCiclosporin\nIn heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once \ndaily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin \n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\nlevels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of \nleukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with \nposaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. \nto about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be \nmonitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, \nand the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.\n\nTacrolimus\nPosaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % \nand 358 %, respectively. Clinically significant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or \nposaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating posaconazole \ntreatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to \nabout one third of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored \ncarefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of \ntacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.\n\nHIV Protease inhibitors\nAs HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase \nplasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral \nsuspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects \nCmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), \nrespectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with \natazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of \natazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The \naddition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated \nwith increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity \nrelated to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during co-\nadministration with posaconazole.\n\nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4\nIn a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) \nincreased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in \nhealthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily \nfor 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average \nof 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice \ndaily for 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to \n7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg \nsingle oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg \nor 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to 8-\n10 hours during co-administration.\nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered \nwhen posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by \nCYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).\n\nCalcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, \nnisoldipine)\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is \nrecommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel \nblockers may be required.\n\nDigoxin\nAdministration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, \nposaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored \nwhen initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nSulfonylureas\nGlucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered \nwith posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere is insufficient information on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole \nmust not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential \nrisk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nPosaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of \nposaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with posaconazole.\n\nFertility\nPosaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (2.8 times the exposure \nachieved from a 300 mg intravenous dose in human) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg (3.4 times\nthe exposure from a 300 mg intravenous dose in patients). There is no clinical experience assessing \nthe impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSince certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with \nposaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be \nused.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSafety data mainly derive from studies with the oral suspension.\n\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion was investigated in AML and MDS patients and those \nafter HSCT with or at risk for GVHD only. Maximum duration of exposure to the concentrate for \nsolution for infusion was shorter than with the oral suspension. Plasma exposure resulting from the \nsolution for infusion was higher than observed with the oral suspension. A higher incidence of \nadverse reactions cannot be ruled out.\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nPosaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion safety\nIn initial studies of healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of posaconazole infused over \n30 minutes via a peripheral venous catheter was associated with a 12 % incidence of infusion site \nreactions (4 % incidence of thrombophlebitis). Multiple doses of posaconazole administered via a \nperipheral venous catheter were associated with thrombophlebitis (60 % incidence). Therefore, in \nsubsequent studies posaconazole was administered via central venous catheter. If a central venous \ncatheter was not readily available, patients could receive a single infusion over 30 minutes via a \nperipheral venous catheter. Peripheral infusion time longer than 30 minutes, leads to a higher \nincidence of infusion site reactions and thrombophlebitis.\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nThe safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion has been assessed in 268 patients in \nclinical trials. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of \nposaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion when given as antifungal prophylaxis \n(Study 5520). Eleven patients received a single dose of 200 mg posaconazole concentrate for solution \nfor infusion, 21 patients received 200 mg daily dose for a median of 14 days, and 237 patients \nreceived 300 mg daily dose for a median of 9 days. No safety data are available for administration \n> 28 days. Safety data in the elderly are limited.\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction (>25 %) with an onset during the posaconazole \nintravenous phase of dosing with 300 mg once daily was diarrhoea (32 %).\n\nThe most common adverse reaction (>1 %) leading to discontinuation of posaconazole concentrate for \nsolution for infusion 300 mg once daily was AML (1 %). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\nTable 2.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no experience with overdose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion.\n\nDuring clinical trials, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day \nexperienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. \nAccidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice \na day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.\n\nPosaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of \noverdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02A \nC04.\n\nMechanism of action\nPosaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential \nstep in ergosterol biosynthesis.\n\nMicrobiology\nPosaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the following microorganisms: Aspergillus\nspecies (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ustus), Candida species \n(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, \nC. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis), Coccidioides immitis, Fonsecaea \npedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus. The microbiological data \nsuggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus; however the clinical \ndata are currently too limited to assess the efficacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.\n\nResistance\nClinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle \nmechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n50\n\nEpidemiological Cut-off (ECOFF) values for Aspergillus spp.\nThe ECOFF values for posaconazole, which distinguish the wild type population from isolates with \nacquired resistance, have been determined by EUCAST methodology.\n\nEUCAST ECOFF values:\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus flavus: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus fumigatus: 0.25 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus nidulans: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus niger: 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus terreus: 0.25 mg/L\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for Aspergillus spp. ECOFF values do \nnot equate to clinical breakpoints.\n\nBreakpoints\nEUCAST MIC breakpoints for posaconazole [susceptible (S); resistant (R)]:\n\uf0b7 Candida albicans: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Candida tropicalis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Candida parapsilosis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Candida species.\n\nCombination with other antifungal agents\nThe use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole \nor the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will \nprovide an added benefit.\n\nClinical experience\n\nSummary of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion bridging study\nStudy 5520 was a non-comparative multi-center study performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic \nproperties, safety, and tolerability of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion. \n\nStudy 5520 enrolled a total of 279 subjects, including 268 receiving at least one dose of posaconazole \nconcentrate for solution for infusion. Cohort 0 was designed to evaluate the tolerability of a single \ndose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion when administered via a central line. \nThe subject population for Cohorts 1 and 2 included subjects with AML or MDS who had recently \nreceived chemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia. \nTwo different dosing groups were evaluated in Cohorts 1 and 2: 200 mg twice daily on Day 1, \nfollowed by 200 mg once daily thereafter (Cohort 1) and 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by \n300 mg once daily thereafter (Cohort 2).\n\nThe subject population in Cohort 3 included: 1) patients with AML or MDS who had recently \nreceived chemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia, or \n2) patients who had undergone a HSCT and were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for \nprevention or treatment of GVHD. These types of patients had been previously studied in a pivotal \ncontrolled trial of posaconazole oral suspension. Based on the pharmacokinetics and safety results of \nCohorts 1 and 2, all subjects in Cohort 3 received 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 300 mg \nonce daily thereafter.\n\nThe total subject population had a mean age of 51 years (range = 18-82 years), 95 % were White, the \nmajor ethnicity was not Hispanic or Latino (92 %), and 55 % were male. The study treated 155 \n(65 %) subjects with AML or MDS, and 82 (35 %) subjects with HSCT, as the primary diseases at \nstudy entry.\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nSerial pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 1 and at steady-state on Day 14 for all Cohort \n1 and 2 subjects and on Day 10 for a subset of Cohort 3 subjects. This serial pharmacokinetic analysis \ndemonstrated that 94 % of the subjects treated with the 300 mg once daily dose attained steady state \nCav between 500-2500 ng/mL [Cav was the average concentration of posaconazole at steady state, \ncalculated as AUC/dosing interval (24 hours).]. This exposure was selected based on \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodymanic considerations with posaconazole oral suspension. Subjects who \nreceived 300 mg once daily achieved a mean Cav at steady state of 1500 ng/mL.\n\nSummary of posaconazole oral suspension studies\n\nInvasive aspergillosis\nOral posaconazole suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of \ninvasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal \nformulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a non-\ncomparative salvage therapy trial. Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an external control \ngroup derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control group included \n86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the same sites as \nthe patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were considered to be \nrefractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external control group \n(79 %).\n\nAs shown in Table 3, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment \nwas seen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, \nthis was not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external \ncontrol group should be viewed with caution.\n\nTable 3.

Among \neighteen patients who were intolerant or had infections refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, \nseven patients were classed as responders.\n\nChromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma\n9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis \ndue to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species.\n\nCoccidioidomycosis\n11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of \nsigns and symptoms present at baseline) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days.\n\n                                                     \n3 Includes other less common species or species unknown\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nProphylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899)\nTwo randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high risk for \ndeveloping invasive fungal infections.\n\nStudy 316 was a randomised, double-blind trial of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times \na day) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomisation as determined by an independent, \nblinded external expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nduring the on-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The \nmajority (377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive \n(195/600, [32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole \nand 77 days for fluconazole.\n\nStudy 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three \ntimes a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg \ntwice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute \nmyelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the\nincidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel \nduring the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nat 100 days post-randomisation. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most \ncommon underlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for \nposaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole.\n\nIn both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 4\nand 5 for results from both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients \nreceiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients.\n\nTable 4.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the \nprobability of survival up to day 100 after randomisation, was significantly higher for posaconazole \nrecipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death \n(P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209).\n\nIn Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFI-\nrelated deaths was significantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU \ngroup (12/299; P= 0.0413).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no paediatric experience for posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion.\n\nSixteen patients 8-17 years of age were treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in a \nstudy for invasive fungal infections. Based on the available data in 16 of these paediatric patients, the \nsafety profile appears to be similar to patients \u2265 18 years of age.\n\nAdditionally, twelve patients 13-17 years of age received posaconazole oral suspension 600 mg/day \nfor prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (Studies 316 and 1899). The safety profile in these \npatients < 18 years of age appears similar to the safety profile observed in adults. Based on \npharmacokinetic data in 10 of these paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic profile appears to be \nsimilar to patients \u2265 18 years of age.\n\nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.\n\nElectrocardiogram evaluation\nMultiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during \nadministration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from \n173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the \nmean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships\nA correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical \noutcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is \n\n \n\n\n\n54\n\nparticularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected \nwith Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens).\n\nDistribution\nFollowing administration of 300 mg posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion over \n90 minutes, mean peak plasma concentration at the end of infusion was 3280 ng/mL (74 % CV). \nPosaconazole exhibits dose proportional pharmacokinetics after single and multiple dosing in the \ntherapeutic dose range (200-300 mg). Posaconazole has a distribution volume of 261 L, indicating \nextravascular distribution.\n\nPosaconazole is highly protein bound (> 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.\n\nBiotransformation\nPosaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites. Of the circulating metabolites, the \nmajority are glucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 \nmediated) metabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for \napproximately 17 % of the administered radiolabelled dose of posaconazole oral suspension.\n\nElimination\nPosaconazole, after administration of 300 mg of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion, is \nslowly eliminated with a mean half-life (t\u00bd) of 27 hours and a mean clearance of 7.3 L/hr. After \nadministration of 14C-posaconazole as oral suspension, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in \nthe faeces (77 % of the radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % \nof the radiolabelled dose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the \nradiolabelled dose excreted in urine (< 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-\nstate plasma concentrations are attained by Day 6 at the 300 mg dose (once daily after twice daily \nloading dose at Day 1).\n\nPosaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole concentrate for \nsolution for infusion single dose increased in a greater than dose proportional manner over the range \nof 50-200 mg; by comparison, dose-dependent increases were observed over a range of 200-300 mg.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nChildren (< 18 years)\nThere is no paediatric experience with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\nGender\nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole concentration for solution for infusion are comparable in men \nand women.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion are comparable in young \nand elderly subjects. No overall differences in safety were observed between the geriatric patients and \nyounger patients; therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for geriatric patients.\n\nRace\nThere is insufficient data among different races with posaconazole concentrate for solution for \ninfusion.\n\nThere was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black \nsubjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety profile of posaconazole between the \nBlack and Caucasian subjects was similar.\n\n \n\n\n\n55\n\nWeight\nPharmacokinetic modelling with an oral tablet formulation suggests that patients weighing greater \nthan 120 kg may have lower posaconazole exposure. It is, therefore, suggested to closely monitor for \nbreakthrough fungal infections in patients weighing more than 120 kg. Patients with a low body \nweight (< 60 kg) are more likely to experience higher plasma concentrations of posaconazole and \nshould be closely monitored for adverse events.\n\nRenal impairment \nFollowing single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild \nand moderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr \u2265 20 mL/min/1.73 m\n\n2) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; \ntherefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr\n< 20 mL/min/1.73 m2), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [> 96 % CV (coefficient of \nvariance)] compared to other renal groups [< 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not \nsignificantly renally eliminated, an effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nposaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed \nby haemodialysis. Due to the variability in exposure, patients with severe renal impairment should be \nmonitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections (see section 4.2).\n\nSimilar recommendations apply to posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion; however, a \nspecific study has not been conducted with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion.\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfter a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per \ngroup), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that \nthere is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60 % increase in total \nAUC. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in \nrespective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic \nimpairment but caution is advised due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.\n\nSimilar recommendations apply to posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion; however, a \nspecific study has not been conducted with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAs observed with other azole antifungal agents, effects related to inhibition of steroid hormone \nsynthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects \nwere observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained \nat therapeutic doses in humans. \n\nNeuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for \uf0b3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than \nthose obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one \nyear. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed \non the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved \ntherapeutically.\n\nPulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the \n2-year study in rats. These findings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for functional changes \nin humans.\n\nNo effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety \npharmacology study in monkeys at maximal plasma concentrations 8.9-fold greater than the \nconcentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans with 300 mg intravenous infusion \nadministration. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac decompensation in a repeat dose \nsafety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 2.2-fold greater than that achieved \n\n \n\n\n\n56\n\ntherapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats \nand monkeys at systemic exposures 2.2-fold and 8.9-fold greater, respectively, than those achieved \nwith the human therapeutic doses.\n\nA non-dose related incidence of thrombus/emboli in the lung was seen in the 1 month repeated dose \nstudy in the monkey. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.\n\nReproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower \nthan those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and \nmalformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal \nviability. In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at \ntherapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were \nconsidered to be due to a treatment-related effect on steroidogenesis.\n\nPosaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal \nspecial hazards for humans.\n\nIn a nonclinical study using intravenous administration of posaconazole in very young dogs (dosed \nfrom 2-8 weeks of age) an increase in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement was observed in \ntreated animals as compared with concurrent control animals. No difference in the incidence of brain \nventricle enlargement between control and treated animals was observed following the subsequent \n5-month treatment-free period. There were no neurologic, behavioural or developmental abnormalities \nin the dogs with this finding, and a similar brain finding was not seen with oral posaconazole \nadministration to juvenile dogs (4 days to 9 months of age). The clinical significance of this finding is \nunknown; therefore, the use of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion to patients under \n18 years of age is not recommended (see section 4.2).\n\n6.

What Noxafil is and what it is used for\n\nNoxafil contains a medicine called posaconazole. This belongs to a group of medicines called \n\u201cantifungals\u201d. Noxafil is used to prevent and treat many different fungal infections.\n\nNoxafil works by killing or stopping the growth of some types of fungi that can cause infections. \n\nNoxafil can be used in adults to treat the following types of fungal infections when other antifungal \nmedicines have not worked or you have had to stop taking them:\n\uf0b7 infections caused by fungi of the Aspergillus family that have not improved during treatment \n\nwith the anti-fungal medicines amphotericin B or itraconazole or when these medicines have \nhad to be stopped;\n\n\uf0b7 infections caused by fungi of the Fusarium family that have not improved during treatment with \namphotericin B or when amphotericin B has had to be stopped;\n\n\uf0b7 infections caused by fungi that cause the conditions known as \u201cchromoblastomycosis\u201d and \n\u201cmycetoma\u201d that have not improved during treatment with itraconazole or when itraconazole \nhas had to be stopped;\n\n\uf0b7 infections caused by a fungus called Coccidioides. that have not improved during treatment \nwith one or more of amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have \nhad to be stopped.\n\nNoxafil can also be used to prevent fungal infections in adults who are at high risk of getting a fungal \ninfection, such as:\n\uf0b7 patients who have a weak immune system due to having chemotherapy for \u201cacute myelogenous \n\nleukemia\u201d (AML) or \u201cmyelodysplastic syndromes\u201d (MDS) \n\uf0b7 patients having \u201chigh-dose immunosuppressive therapy\u201d after \u201chematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplant\u201d (HSCT).\n\n \n\n\n\n94\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Noxafil\n\nDo not use Noxafil\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to posaconazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\uf0b7 if you are taking: terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine, quinidine, any \n\nmedicines that contain \u201cergot alkaloids\u201d such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine, or a \u201cstatin\u201d \nsuch as simvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin.\n\nDo not use Noxafil if any of the above apply to you.

is intended for healthcare professionals only:\n\nAdministration instructions for Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n\uf0b7 Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of Noxafil to room temperature.\n\uf0b7 Aseptically transfer 16.7 mL of posaconazole to an intravenous bag (or bottle) containing a \n\ncompatible admixture diluent (see below for list of diluents) using the volume ranging from \n150 mL to 283 mL depending on the final concentration to be achieved (not less than 1 mg/mL \nand not greater than 2 mg/mL).\n\n\uf0b7 Administer via a central venous line, including a central venous catheter or peripherally \ninserted central catheter (PICC) by slow intravenous infusion over approximately 90 minutes.\nNoxafil concentrate for solution for infusion should not be given by bolus administration.\n\n\uf0b7 If a central venous catheter is not available, a single infusion may be administered through a \nperipheral venous catheter with a volume to achieve a dilution of approximately 2 mg/mL. \nWhen administered through a peripheral venous catheter, the infusion should be administered \nover approximately 30 minutes.\nNote: In clinical trials, multiple peripheral infusions given through the same vein resulted \nin infusion site reactions (see section 4.8).\n\n\uf0b7 Noxafil is for single use.\n\nThe following medicinal products can be infused at the same time through the same intravenous line \n(or cannula) as Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion:\n\nAmikacin sulfate\nCaspofungin\nCiprofloxacin\nDaptomycin\nDobutamine hydrochloride\nFamotidine\nFilgrastim\nGentamicin sulfate\nHydromorphone hydrochloride\n\n \n\n\n\n102\n\nLevofloxacin\nLorazepam\nMeropenem\nMicafungin\nMorphine sulphate\nNorepinephrine bitartrate\nPotassium chloride\nVancomycin hydrochloride\n\nAny products not listed in the table above should not be coadministered with Noxafil through the \nsame intravenous line (or cannula).\n\nThe infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. The \nsolution of Noxafil ranges from colourless to pale yellow. Variations of colour within this range do \nnot affect the quality of the product.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\nNoxafil must not be diluted with:\nLactated Ringer\u2019s solution\n5 % dextrose with Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution\n4.2 % sodium bicarbonate\n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned \nbelow:\n\n5 % dextrose in water\n0.9 % sodium chloride\n0.45 % sodium chloride\n5 % dextrose and 0.45 % sodium chloride\n5 % dextrose and 0.9 % sodium chloride\n5 % dextrose and 20 mEq KCl\n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tD.

\"antifungals\". it is used to prevent and treat many different fungal infections. this medicine works by killing or stopping the growth of some types of fungi that can cause infections. noxafil can be used in adults to treat the following types of fungal infections when other antifungal medicines have not worked or you have had to stop taking them: infections caused by fungi of the aspergillus family that have not improved during treatment with the anti-fungal medicines amphotericin b or itraconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped; infections caused by fungi of the fusarium family that have not improved during treatment with amphotericin b or when amphotericin b has had to be stopped; infections caused by fungi that cause the conditions known as \"chromoblastomycosis\" and \"mycetoma\" that have not improved during treatment with itraconazole or when itraconazole has had to be stopped; infections caused by a fungus called coccidioides that have not improved during treatment with one or more of amphotericin b, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped. infections in the mouth or throat area (known as \"thrush\") caused by fungi called candida, which were not previously treated. this medicine can also be used to prevent fungal infections in adults who are at high risk of getting a fungal infection, such as: patients who have a weak immune system due to having chemotherapy for \"acute myelogenous leukemia\" (aml) or \"myelodysplastic syndromes\" (mds) patients having \"high-dose immunosuppressive therapy\" after \"hematopoietic stem cell transplant\" (hsct).", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "noxafil", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 2, "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 7,
