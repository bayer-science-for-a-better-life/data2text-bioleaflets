PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection (injection). \nThe vaccine is a turbid white suspension. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by \nStreptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age. See sections 4.4 \nand 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes. \n \nThe use of Synflorix should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the impact on pneumococcal diseases in different age groups as well as the variability of \nthe epidemiology in different geographical areas.  \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe immunisation schedules for Synflorix should be based on official recommendations.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nInfants from 6 weeks to 6 months of age \n \nThree-dose primary series \nThe recommended immunisation series to ensure optimal protection consists of four doses, each of  \n0.5 ml. The primary infant series consists of three doses with the first dose usually given at 2 months \nof age and with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as \n6 weeks of age. A booster (fourth) dose is recommended at least 6 months after the last primary dose \nand may be given from the age of 9 months onwards (preferably between 12 and 15 months of age) \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nTwo-dose primary series \nAlternatively, when Synflorix is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a series \nconsisting of three doses, each of 0.5 ml may be given. The first dose may be given as early as 6 \nweeks of age with a second dose administered 2 months later. A booster (third) dose is recommended \nat least 6 months after the last primary dose and may be given from the age of 9 months onwards \n(preferably between 12 and 15 months of age) (see section 5.1). \n \nPreterm newborn infants (born between 27–36 weeks gestation) \n \nIn preterm infants born after at least 27 weeks of gestational age, the recommended immunisation \nseries consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The primary infant series consists of three doses with the \nfirst dose given at 2 months of age and with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. A booster \n(fourth) dose is recommended at least 6 months after the last primary dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nUnvaccinated infants and children ≥ 7 months of age \n \n–  infants aged 7–11 months: The vaccination schedule consists of two primary doses of 0.5 ml with \n\nan interval of at least 1 month between doses. A booster (third) dose is recommended in the second \nyear of life with an interval of at least 2 months after the last primary dose. \n\n \n–  children aged 12 months –5 years: The vaccination schedule consists of two doses of 0.5 ml with an \n\ninterval of at least 2 months between doses.  \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Synflorix complete the full vaccination \ncourse with Synflorix. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIn individuals who have underlying conditions predisposing them to invasive pneumococcal disease \n(such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, sickle cell disease (SCD) or splenic \ndysfunction), Synflorix may be given according to the above mentioned schedules except that a 3-dose \nschedule should be given as primary vaccination in infants starting vaccination from 6 weeks to 6 \nmonths of age (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Synflorix in children over 5 years of age have not been established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe vaccine should be given by intramuscular injection. The preferred sites are anterolateral aspect of \nthe thigh in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in young children. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to any of \nthe carrier proteins.  \n \nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Synflorix should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not \nresult in the deferral of vaccination. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPrior to immunisation \n  \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48–72 h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit \nof vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. \n \nSynflorix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. No data are \navailable on subcutaneous administration of Synflorix. \n \nIn children as of 2 years of age, syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any \nvaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that procedures are in \nplace to avoid injury from faints. \n \nAs for other vaccines administered intramuscularly, Synflorix should be given with caution to \nindividuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder since bleeding may occur following an \nintramuscular administration to these subjects.  \n \nInformation on protection conferred by the vaccine \n \nOfficial recommendations for the immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b should also be followed. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence that Synflorix provides protection against pneumococcal serotypes not \ncontained in the vaccine except the cross-reactive serotype 19A (see section 5.1) or against non-\ntypeable Haemophilus influenzae. Synflorix does not provide protection against other micro-\norganisms. \n \nAs with any vaccine, Synflorix may not protect all vaccinated individuals against invasive \npneumococcal disease, pneumonia or otitis media caused by the serotypes in the vaccine and the \ncross-reactive serotype 19A. In addition, as otitis media and pneumonia are caused by many micro-\norganisms other than the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes represented by the vaccine, the overall \nprotection against these diseases is expected to be limited and substantially lower than protection \nagainst invasive disease caused by the serotypes in the vaccine and serotype 19A (see section 5.1). \n  \nIn clinical trials, Synflorix elicited an immune response to all ten serotypes included in the vaccine, \nbut the magnitude of the responses varied between serotypes. The functional immune response to \nserotypes 1 and 5 was lower in magnitude than the response against all other vaccine serotypes. It is \nnot known whether this lower functional immune response against serotypes 1 and 5 will result in \n\n\n\n5 \n\nlower protective efficacy against invasive disease, pneumonia or otitis media caused by these \nserotypes (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren should receive the dose regimen of Synflorix that is appropriate to their age at the time of \ncommencing the vaccination series (see section 4.2).   \n \nImmunosuppressive therapy and immunodeficiency \n \nChildren with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, HIV infection, prenatal exposure to anti-retroviral therapy and/or to HIV, or \nother causes, may have reduced antibody response to vaccination. \n \nSafety and immunogenicity data are available for HIV infected infants (asymptomatic or with mild \nsymptoms according to WHO classification), HIV negative infants born from HIV positive mothers, \nchildren with sickle cell disease and children with splenic dysfunction (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \nSafety and immunogenicity data for Synflorix are not available for individuals in other specific \nimmunocompromised groups and vaccination should be considered on an individual basis (see section \n4.2). \n \nThe use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccines in children ≥ 2 years of age with conditions (such as sickle cell disease, \nasplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness, or those who have other immunocompromising conditions) \nplacing them at higher risk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Whenever \nrecommended, children at risk who are ≥ 24 months of age and already primed with Synflorix should \nreceive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The interval between the pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (Synflorix) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be \nless than 8 weeks. There are no data available to indicate whether the administration of pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine to Synflorix primed children may result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses \nof pneumococcal polysaccharide or to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nProphylactic use of antipyretics \n \nProphylactic administration of antipyretics before or immediately after vaccine administration can \nreduce the incidence and intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Clinical data generated with \nparacetamol and ibuprofen suggest that the prophylactic use of paracetamol might reduce the fever \nrate, while prophylactic use of ibuprofen showed a limited effect in reducing fever rate. The clinical \ndata suggest that paracetamol might reduce the immune response to Synflorix. However, the clinical \nrelevance of this observation is not known. \n \nThe use of prophylactic antipyretic medicinal products is recommended: \n- for all children receiving Synflorix simultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis \n\nbecause of higher rate of febrile reactions (see section 4.8). \n- for children with seizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures. \nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines. \n   \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nUse with other vaccines  \n \nSynflorix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines \n[including DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPw-HBV/Hib]: diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine \n(DTPa), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b \nvaccine (Hib), diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTPw), measles-mumps-rubella \nvaccine (MMR), varicella vaccine (V), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (CRM197 and \nTT conjugates), meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (TT conjugate), \noral polio vaccine (OPV) and oral rotavirus vaccine. Different injectable vaccines should always be \ngiven at different injection sites. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nClinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the co-administered \nvaccines were unaffected, with the exception of the inactivated poliovirus type 2 response, for which \ninconsistent results were observed across studies (seroprotection ranging from 78% to 100%). In \naddition when the meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y vaccine (TT conjugate) was co-\nadministered with a booster dose of Synflorix during the second year of life in children primed with 3 \ndoses of Synflorix, lower antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) and opsonophagocytic assay \ngeometric mean titre (OPA GMT) were observed for one pneumococcal serotype (18 C). There was no \nimpact of co-administration on the other nine pneumococcal serotypes. Enhancement of antibody \nresponse to Hib-TT conjugate, diphtheria and tetanus antigens was observed. The clinical relevance of \nthe above observations is unknown. \n \nUse with systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products \n \nAs with other vaccines, it may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment an \nadequate response may not be elicited.  \n \nUse with prophylactic administration of antipyretics \n \nClinical data suggest that prophylactic administration of paracetamol, used to reduce the rate of \npossible post-vaccination febrile reactions, might reduce the immune response to Synflorix. However, \nthe clinical relevance of this observation is not known. See section 4.4. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nSynflorix is not intended for use in adults. Human data on the use during pregnancy or breast-feeding \nand animal reproduction studies are not available. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSafety assessment of Synflorix was based on clinical trials involving the administration of 63,905 \ndoses of Synflorix to 22,429 healthy children and 137 preterm infants as primary vaccination. \nFurthermore, 19,466 children and 116 preterm infants received a booster dose of Synflorix in the \nsecond year of life. \nSafety was also assessed in 435 previously unvaccinated children from 2 to 5 years old of which 285 \nsubjects received 2 doses of Synflorix. \nIn all trials, Synflorix was administered concurrently with the recommended childhood vaccines. \n \nIn infants, the most common adverse reactions observed after primary vaccination were redness at \nthe injection site and irritability which occurred after approximately 41% and 55% of all doses \nrespectively. Following booster vaccination, the most common adverse reactions were pain at the \ninjection site and irritability, which occurred at approximately 51% and 53% respectively. The \nmajority of these reactions were of mild to moderate severity and were not long lasting. \n \nNo increase in the incidence or severity of the adverse reactions was seen with subsequent doses of \nthe primary vaccination series. \n \nLocal reactogenicity of primary vaccination course was similar in infants < 12 months of age and in \nchildren > 12 months of age except for injection site pain for which the incidence increased with \nincreasing age: pain was reported by more than 39% of the infants < 12 months of age and by more \nthan 58% of the children > 12 months of age. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nFollowing booster vaccination, children > 12 months of age are more likely to experience injection site \nreactions compared to the rates observed in infants during the primary series with Synflorix. \n \nFollowing catch-up vaccination in children 12 to 23 months of age, urticaria was reported more \nfrequently (uncommon) compared to the rates observed in infants during primary and booster \nvaccination. \n \nReactogenicity was higher in children receiving whole cell pertussis vaccines concomitantly. In a \nclinical study children received either Synflorix (N=603) or 7-valent Prevenar (N=203) concomitantly \nwith a DTPw containing vaccine. After the primary vaccination course, fever ≥38 °C and >39 °C was \nreported respectively in 86.1% and 14.7% of children receiving Synflorix and in 82.9% and 11.6% of \nchildren vaccinated with 7-valent Prevenar. \n \nIn comparative clinical studies, the incidence of local and general adverse events reported within 4 \ndays after each vaccination dose was within the same range as after vaccination with 7-valent \nPrevenar. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions (for all age groups)have been categorised by frequency. \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common: (≥1/10) \nCommon: (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare:   (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping the adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nClinical trials \nImmune system disorders Rare Allergic reactions (such as eczema, allergic \n\ndermatitis, atopic dermatitis) \nVery rare Angioedema \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Appetite lost \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n \n\nVery common Irritability \nUncommon Crying abnormal \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Drowsiness \nRare Convulsions (including febrile convulsions) \n\nVascular disorders Very rare Kawasaki disease \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Apnoea in very premature infants (≤ 28 weeks \nof gestation) (see section 4.4) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Diarrhoea, vomiting \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Rash \nRare Urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\nVery common Fever ≥ 38 °C rectally (age < 2 years), pain, \nredness, swelling at the injection site. \n\nCommon Fever > 39 °C rectally (age < 2 years), injection \nsite reactions like injection site induration  \n\nUncommon Injection site reactions like injection site \nhaematoma, haemorrhage and nodule \n\nAdverse reactions additionally reported after booster vaccination of primary series and/or catch-up \n\n\n\n8 \n\nvaccination: \nNervous system disorders Uncommon Headache (age 2 to 5 years) \nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea (age 2 to 5 years) \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Fever ≥ 38 °C rectally (age 2 to 5 years) \nUncommon Fever > 40 °C rectally (age < 2 years), fever > \n\n39 °C rectally (age 2 to 5 years), injection site \nreactions like diffuse swelling of the injected \nlimb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint, \npruritus.  \n\nPost-marketing experience \nImmune system disorders Very rare Anaphylaxis \nNervous system disorders Rare Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode \n \nSpecial populations \n \nSafety of Synflorix was assessed in 83 HIV positive (HIV+/+) infants (asymptomatic or with mild \nsymptoms according to WHO classification), 101 HIV negative infants born from HIV positive \nmothers (HIV+/-) and 50 infants with sickle cell disease (SCD), receiving primary vaccination. Of \nthese, 76, 96 and 49 infants, respectively, received a booster dose. Safety of Synflorix was also \nassessed in 50 children with SCD starting vaccination at 7–11 months of age, all of them receiving \nthe booster vaccination, and in 50 children with SCD starting vaccination at 12–23 months of age. \nResults suggest comparable reactogenicity and safety profile of Synflorix between these high risk \ngroups and healthy children. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AL52 \n \nEpidemiological data \n \nThe 10 pneumococcal serotypes included in this vaccine represent the major disease-causing serotypes \nin Europe covering approximately 56% to 90% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children <5 \nyears of age. In this age group, serotypes 1, 5 and 7F account for 3.3% to 24.1% of IPD depending on \nthe country and time period studied. \n \nPneumonia of different aetiologies is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally. In \nprospective studies, Streptococcus pneumoniae was estimated to be responsible for 30-50% of \npneumonia cases. \n \nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease with different aetiologies. Bacteria can be \nresponsible for 60-70% of clinical episodes of AOM. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Non-Typeable \nHaemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are the most common causes of bacterial AOM worldwide. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nEfficacy and effectiveness in clinical trials \n \nIn a large-scale phase III/IV, double-blind, cluster-randomized, controlled, clinical trial in Finland \n(FinIP), children were randomised into 4 groups according to the two infant vaccination schedules \n[2-dose (3, 5 months of age) or 3-dose (3, 4, 5 months of age) primary schedule followed by a booster \ndose as of 11 months of age] to receive either Synflorix (2/3rd of clusters) or hepatitis vaccines as \ncontrol (1/3rd of clusters). In the catch-up cohorts, children between 7–11 months of age at first \nvaccine dose received Synflorix or hepatitis B control vaccine according to a 2-dose primary schedule \nfollowed by a booster dose and children between 12–18 months of age at first vaccine dose received \n2 doses of either Synflorix or hepatitis A control vaccine. Average follow-up, from first vaccination, \nwas 24 to 28 months for invasive disease and hospital-diagnosed pneumonia. In a nested study, infants \nwere followed up till approximately 21 months of age to assess impact on nasopharyngeal carriage and \nphysician-diagnosed AOM reported by parents. \n \nIn a large-scale phase III, randomized, double-blind clinical trial (Clinical Otitis Media and \nPneumonia Study - COMPAS) conducted in Argentina, Panama and Colombia, healthy infants aged \n6 to 16 weeks received either Synflorix or hepatitis B control vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months of age \nfollowed respectively by either Synflorix or hepatitis A control vaccine at 15 to 18 months of age. \n \nInvasive pneumococcal disease (which includes sepsis, meningitis, bacteraemic pneumonia and \nbacteraemia) \n \nEffectiveness/efficacy in infant cohort below 7 months of age at enrolment \n \nVaccine effectiveness or efficacy (VE) was demonstrated in preventing culture-confirmed IPD due to \nvaccine pneumococcal serotypes when Synflorix was given to infants in either 2+1 or 3+1 schedules \nin FinIP or 3+1 schedule in COMPAS (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of vaccine serotype IPD cases and vaccine effectiveness (FinIP) or efficacy \n(COMPAS) in infants below 7 months of age at enrolment receiving at least one vaccine dose \n(Infant total vaccinated cohort) \n\nType of \nIPD \n\nFinIP COMPAS \n\nNo. of IPD cases VE (95% CI) No. of IPD cases \nVE \n\n(95% CI) \nSynflorix \n\n3+1 \nschedule \n\nSynflorix \n2+1 \n\nschedule \n\nControl(2) \n 3+1 \n\nschedule \n2+1 \n\nschedule \n\nSynflorix \n3+1 \n\nschedule  \nControl 3+1 \n\nschedule N \n10,273 \n\nN \n10,054 \n\nN \n10,200 \n\nN \n11,798 \n\nN \n11,799 \n\nVaccine \nserotype \n\nIPD(1) \n0 1 12 100%\n\n(3) \n(82.8; 100) \n\n91.8%(4) \n(58.3; 99.6) 0 18 \n\n100%(5) \n(77.3; 100) \n\nSerotype \n6B IPD 0 0 5 \n\n100% \n(54.9; 100) \n\n100% \n(54.5; 100) 0 2 - \n\nSerotype \n14 IPD 0 0 4 \n\n100% \n(39.6; 100) \n\n100% \n(43.3; 100) 0 9 \n\n100% \n(49.5; 100) \n\nIPD Invasive Pneumococcal Disease \nVE Vaccine effectiveness (FinIP) or efficacy (COMPAS) \nN number of subjects per group \nCI Confidence Interval \n(1) In FinIP apart from serotypes 6B and 14, culture-confirmed vaccine serotype IPD cases \n\nincluded 7F (1 case in the Synflorix 2+1 clusters), 18C, 19F and 23F (1 case of each in the \ncontrol clusters). In COMPAS, serotypes 5 (2 cases), 18C (4 cases) and 23F (1 case) were \ndetected in control group in addition to serotypes 6B and 14. \n\n(2) the 2 groups of control clusters of infants were pooled \n(3) p-value<0.0001 \n(4) p-value=0.0009 \n\n\n\n10 \n\n(5) in the ATP cohort VE was 100% (95% CI: 74.3; 100; 0 versus 16 cases) \n \nIn FinIP the overall observed VE against culture-confirmed IPD was 100% (95% CI: 85.6; 100; 0 \nversus 14 cases) for the 3+1 schedule, 85.8% (95% CI: 49.1; 97.8; 2 versus 14 cases) for the 2+1 \nschedule and 93.0% (95% CI: 74.9; 98.9; 2 versus 14 cases) regardless of the primary vaccination \nschedule. In COMPAS it was 66.7% (95% CI: 21.8; 85.9; 7 versus 21 cases). \n \nEffectiveness following catch-up immunisation \n \nAmong the 15,447 children in the catch-up vaccinated cohorts, there were no culture-confirmed IPD \ncases in the Synflorix groups while 5 vaccine serotype IPD cases were observed in the control groups \n(serotypes 4, 6B, 7F, 14 and 19F). \n \nPneumonia \n \nEfficacy against pneumonia was assessed in COMPAS. The mean duration follow-up from 2 weeks \npost-dose 3 in the ATP cohort was 23 months (range from 0 to 34 months) for the interim analysis \n(IA) and 30 months (range from 0 to 44 months) for the end-of-study analysis. At the end of this IA or \nend-of-study ATP follow-up period, the mean age was 29 months (range from 4 to 41 months) and 36 \nmonths (range from 4 to 50 months), respectively. The proportion of subjects who received the booster \ndose in the ATP cohort was 92.3% in both analyses. \n \nEfficacy of Synflorix against first episodes of likely bacterial Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) \noccurring from 2 weeks after the administration of the 3rd dose was demonstrated in the ATP cohort \n(P value ≤ 0.002) in the interim analysis (event-driven; primary objective).  \nLikely bacterial CAP (B–CAP) is defined as radiologically confirmed CAP cases with either alveolar \nconsolidation/pleural effusion on the chest X-ray, or with non-alveolar infiltrates but with C reactive \nprotein (CRP) ≥ 40 mg/l. \n \nThe vaccine efficacy against B–CAP observed at the interim analysis is presented below (table 2). \n \nTable 2: Numbers and percentages of subjects with first episodes of B–CAP occurring from \n2 weeks after the administration of the 3rd dose of Synflorix or control vaccine and vaccine \nefficacy (ATP cohort) \n\nSynflorix \nN=10,295 \n\nControl vaccine \nN=10,201 Vaccine efficacy \n\nn % (n/N) n % (n/N) \n\n240 2.3% 304 3.0% 22.0% \n(95% CI: 7.7; 34.2) \n\nN number of subjects per group \nn/% number/percentage of subjects reporting a first episode of B–CAP anytime from 2 weeks after \n\nthe administration of the 3rd dose \nCI Confidence Interval \n \nIn the interim analysis (ATP cohort), the vaccine efficacy against first episodes of CAP with alveolar \nconsolidation or pleural effusion (C–CAP, WHO definition) was 25.7% (95% CI: 8.4; 39.6) and \nagainst first episodes of clinically suspected CAP referred for X-ray was 6.7% (95% CI: 0.7; 12.3). \n \nAt the end-of-study analysis (ATP cohort), the vaccine efficacy (first episodes) against B–CAP was \n18.2% (95% CI: 4.1; 30.3), against C–CAP 22.4% (95% CI: 5.7; 36.1) and against clinically suspected \nCAP referred for X-ray 7.3% (95% CI: 1.6; 12.6). Efficacy was 100% (95% CI: 41.9; 100) against \nbacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia or empyema due to vaccine serotypes. The protection against \nB–CAP before booster dose and at the time or after booster dose was 13.6% (95% CI: -11.3; 33.0) and \n21.7% (95% CI: 3.4; 36.5) respectively. For C–CAP it was 15.1% (95% CI: -15.5; 37.6) and 26.3% \n(95% CI: 4.4; 43.2) respectively. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe reduction in B–CAP and C–CAP was greatest in children < 36 months of age (vaccine efficacy of \n20.6% (95% CI: 6.5; 32.6) and 24.2% (95% CI: 7.4; 38.0) respectively). Vaccine efficacy results in \nchildren > 36 months of age suggest a waning of protection. The persistence of protection against  \nB–CAP and C–CAP beyond the age of 36 months is currently not established. \n \nThe results of the COMPAS study, which was performed in Latin America, should be interpreted with \ncaution due to possible differences in epidemiology of pneumonia in different geographical locations. \n \nIn the FinIP study, vaccine effectiveness in reducing hospital-diagnosed pneumonia cases (identified \nbased on the ICD 10 codes for pneumonia) was 26.7% (95% CI: 4.9; 43.5) in the 3+1 infant schedule \nand 29.3% (95% CI: 7.5; 46.3) in the 2+1 infant schedule. For catch-up vaccination, vaccine \neffectiveness was 33.2% (95% CI: 3.0; 53.4) in the 7–11 month cohort and 22.4% (95% CI: -8.7; 44.8) \nin the 12–18 month cohort. \n \nAcute Otitis Media (AOM) \n \nTwo efficacy studies, COMPAS and POET (Pneumococcal Otitis Media Efficacy Trial), were \nconducted with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing protein D: Synflorix and an \ninvestigational 11-valent conjugate vaccine (which in addition contained serotype 3), respectively. \n \nIn COMPAS, 7,214 subjects [Total Vaccinated cohort (TVC)] were included in the AOM efficacy \nanalysis of which 5,989 subjects were in the ATP cohort (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Vaccine efficacy against AOM(1) in COMPAS \n\nType or cause of AOM \nVaccine efficacy  \n\n(95% CI) \nATP(2) \n\nClinical AOM 16.1% (-1.1; 30.4)(3) \n\nAny pneumococcal serotype 56.1% (13.4; 77.8) \n\n10 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes 67.1% (17.0; 86.9) \n\nNon-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) 15.0%\n(4) \n\n(-83.8; 60.7) \nCI Confidence Interval \n(1) First episode \n(2) Follow up period for a maximum of 40 months from 2 weeks after third primary dose \n(3) Not statistically significant by pre-defined criteria (One sided p=0.032). However, in TVC \n\ncohort, vaccine efficacy against first clinical AOM episode was 19% (95% CI: 4.4; 31.4). \n(4) Not statistically significant. \n \nIn another large randomised double-blind trial (POET) conducted in the Czech Republic and in \nSlovakia, 4,907 infants (ATP cohort) received either the 11-valent investigational vaccine (11Pn-PD) \ncontaining the 10 serotypes of Synflorix (along with serotype 3 for which efficacy was not \ndemonstrated) or a control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine) according to a 3, 4, 5 and 12-15 months \nvaccination schedule. \n \nEfficacy of the 11 Pn-PD vaccine against the first occurrence of vaccine serotype AOM episode was \n52.6% (95% CI: 35.0; 65.5). Serotype specific efficacy against the first AOM episode was \ndemonstrated for serotypes 6B (86.5%, 95% CI: 54.9; 96.0), 14 (94.8%, 95% CI: 61.0; 99.3), 19F \n(43.3%, 95% CI: 6.3; 65.4) and 23F (70.8%, 95% CI: 20.8; 89.2). For other vaccine serotypes, the \nnumber of AOM cases was too limited to allow any efficacy conclusion to be drawn. Efficacy against \nany AOM episode due to any pneumococcal serotype was 51.5% (95% CI: 36.8; 62.9). The vaccine \nefficacy against the first episode of NTHi AOM was 31.1% (95% CI: -3.7; 54.2, not significant). \nEfficacy against any NTHi AOM episode was 35.3% (95% CI: 1.8; 57.4). The estimated vaccine \n\n\n\n12 \n\nefficacy against any clinical episodes of otitis media regardless of aetiology was 33.6% (95% CI: 20.8; \n44.3). \n \nBased on immunological bridging of the functional vaccine response (OPA) of Synflorix with the \n11-valent formulation used within POET, it is expected that Synflorix provides similar protective \nefficacy against pneumococcal AOM.  \n \nNo increase in the incidence of AOM due to other bacterial pathogens or non-vaccine/non-vaccine \nrelated serotypes was observed in either COMPAS (based on the few cases reported) or POET trial. \n \nEffectiveness against physician-diagnosed AOM reported by parents was studied in the nested study \nwithin the FinIP trial. Vaccine effectiveness was 6.1% (95% CI: -2.7; 14.1) for the 3+1 schedule and \n7.4% (95% CI -2.8; 16.6) for 2+1 schedule for this AOM endpoint in the infant vaccinated cohort. \n \nImpact on nasopharyngeal carriage (NPC) \n \nThe effect of Synflorix on nasopharyngeal carriage was studied in 2 double-blind randomised studies \nusing an inactive control: in the nested study of FinIP in Finland (5,023 subjects) and in COMPAS \n(1,700 subjects). \n \nIn both COMPAS and the nested Finnish study, Synflorix reduced vaccine type carriage with an \napparent increase in non-vaccine (excluding vaccine-related) serotypes observed after booster. The \nresults were not statistically significant across all analyses in COMPAS. However, taken together \nthere was a trend for decrease in overall pneumococcal carriage. \n \nIn both studies there were significant decrease of individual serotypes 6B and 19F. In the nested \nFinnish study, a significant reduction was also observed for individual serotypes 14, 23F and, in the  \n3 dose primary schedule, for the cross-reactive serotype 19A.   \n \nIn a clinical study NPC was assessed in HIV positive infants (N = 83) and HIV negative infants born \nfrom HIV positive mothers (N = 101) and compared to HIV negative infants born from HIV negative \nmothers (N = 100). The HIV exposure or infection did not appear to alter the effect of Synflorix on \npneumococcal carriage up to 24–27 months of age, i.e. up to 15 months following booster vaccination. \n \nEffectiveness in post-marketing surveillance \n \nIn Brazil, Synflorix was introduced into the national immunisation programme (NIP) using a 3+1 \nschedule in infants (2, 4, 6 months of age and a booster dose at 12 months) with a catch-up campaign \nin children up to 2 years of age. Based on almost 3 years of surveillance following Synflorix \nintroduction, a matched case-control study reported a significant decrease in culture or PCR confirmed \nIPD due to any vaccine serotype, and IPD due to individual serotypes 6B, 14 and 19A. \n \nTable 4: Summary of effectiveness of Synflorix for IPD in Brazil \n\nTypes of IPD(1) Adjusted Effectiveness(2) \n% (95% CI) \n\nAny vaccine serotype IPD(3) \n \n\n- Invasive pneumonia or bacteraemia \n \n\n- Meningitis \n\n83.8% (65.9; 92.3) \n \n\n81.3% (46.9; 93.4) \n \n\n87.7% (61.4; 96.1) \n\n\n\n13 \n\nIPD due to individual serotypes(4) \n \n\n- 6B \n \n\n- 14 \n \n\n- 19A \n\n \n \n\n82.8% (23.8; 96.1) \n \n\n87.7% (60.8; 96.1) \n \n\n82.2% (10.7; 96.4) \n\n(1) Culture or PCR confirmed IPD \n(2) The adjusted effectiveness represents the percent reduction in IPD in the Synflorix vaccinated \ngroup compared to the unvaccinated group, controlling for confounding factors. \n(3) Culture or PCR confirmed cases for serotypes 4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F contributed to \nthe analysis. \n(4) Individual serotypes for which statistical significance was reached in the effectiveness analysis \ncontrolling for confounding factors (no adjustment for multiplicity performed). \n \nIn Finland, Synflorix was introduced into NIP with a 2+1 schedule in infants (3, 5 months of age and a \nbooster dose at 12 months) without catch-up campaign. Before and after NIP comparison suggests a \nsignificant decrease in the incidence of any culture confirmed IPD, any vaccine serotype IPD and IPD \ndue to serotype 19A. \n \nTable 5: Rates of IPD and the corresponding rate reductions in Finland \n\nIPD Incidence per 100,000 person years \n \n\nRelative rate reduction(1)  \n% (95% CI) \n\nBefore NIP After NIP \nAny culture confirmed 62.9 12.9 80% (72; 85) \n\nAny vaccine serotype(2) 49.1 4.2 92% (86; 95) \n\nSerotype 19A 5.5 2.1 62% (20; 85) \n(1) The relative rate reduction indicates how much the incidence of IPD in children of ≤5 years of age \nwas reduced in the Synflorix cohort (followed for 3 years after NIP introduction) versus age and \nseason matched non-vaccinated historical cohorts (each followed for 3 year periods before \nintroduction of Synflorix into NIP). \n(2) Culture confirmed cases for serotypes 1, 4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F contributed to the  \nanalysis. \n \nIn Quebec, Canada, Synflorix was introduced into the infant immunisation programme (2 primary \ndoses to infants less than 6 months of age and a booster dose at 12 months) following 4.5 years of use \nof 7-valent Prevenar. Based on 1.5 years of surveillance following Synflorix introduction, with over \n90% coverage in the vaccine-eligible age group, a decrease in vaccine serotype IPD incidence (largely \ndue to changes in serotype 7F disease) was observed with no concomitant increase in non-vaccine \nserotype IPD incidence. Overall, the incidence of IPD was 35/100,000 person-years in those cohorts \nexposed to Synflorix, and 64/100,000 person-years in those exposed to 7-valent Prevenar, representing \na statistically significant difference (p = 0.03). No direct cause-and-effect can be inferred from \nobservational studies of this type. \n \nImmunogenicity data \n \nImmunologic non-inferiority to 7-valent Prevenar \n \nThe assessment of potential efficacy against IPD pre-licensure was based on a comparison of immune \nresponses to the seven serotypes shared between Synflorix and another pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccine for which protective efficacy was evaluated previously (i.e. 7-valent Prevenar), as \nrecommended by the WHO. Immune responses to the extra three serotypes in Synflorix were also \nmeasured. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn a head-to-head comparative trial with 7-valent Prevenar, non-inferiority of the immune response to \nSynflorix measured by ELISA was demonstrated for all serotypes, except for 6B and 23F (upper limit \nof the 96.5% CI around the difference between groups >10%) (Table 6). For serotypes 6B and 23F, \nrespectively, 65.9% and 81.4% of infants vaccinated at 2, 3 and 4 months reached the antibody \nthreshold (i.e. 0.20 µg/ml) one month after the third dose of Synflorix versus 79.0% and 94.1% \nrespectively, after three doses of 7-valent Prevenar. The clinical relevance of these differences is \nunclear, as Synflorix was observed to be effective against IPD caused by serotype 6B in a double-\nblind, cluster-randomized clinical study (see Table 1). \n \nThe percentage of vaccinees reaching the threshold for the three additional serotypes in Synflorix (1, 5 \nand 7F) was respectively 97.3%, 99.0% and 99.5% and was at least as good as the aggregate 7-valent \nPrevenar response against the 7 common serotypes (95.8%).  \n \nTable 6: Comparative analysis between 7-valent Prevenar and Synflorix in percentage of \nsubjects with antibody concentrations > 0.20 µg/ml one month post-dose 3 \n\nAntibody Synflorix \n \n\n7-valent Prevenar \n \n\nDifference in % ≥ 0.20µg/ml (7-\nvalent Prevenar minus Synflorix) \n\nN % N % % 96.5% CI \nAnti-4 1106 97.1 373 100 2.89 1.71 4.16 \nAnti-6B 1100 65.9 372 79.0 13.12 7.53 18.28 \nAnti-9V 1103 98.1 374 99.5 1.37 -0.28 2.56 \nAnti-14 1100 99.5 374 99.5 -0.08 -1.66 0.71 \nAnti-18C 1102 96.0 374 98.9 2.92 0.88 4.57 \nAnti-19F 1104 95.4 375 99.2 3.83 1.87 5.50 \nAnti-23F 1102 81.4 374 94.1 12.72 8.89 16.13 \n\n \nPost-primary antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) elicited by Synflorix against the seven \nserotypes in common were lower than those elicited by 7-valent Prevenar.

After the booster dose \nthe GMCs elicited by Synflorix were lower for most serotypes in common with 7-valent Prevenar. \n \nIn the same study, Synflorix was shown to elicit functional antibodies to all vaccine serotypes. For \neach of the seven serotypes in common, 87.7% to 100% of Synflorix vaccinees and 92.1% to 100% of \n7-valent Prevenar vaccinees reached an OPA titre ≥ 8 one month after the third dose. The difference \nbetween both vaccines in terms of percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥ 8 was <5% for all \nserotypes in common, including 6B and 23F. Post-primary and post-booster OPA antibody geometric \nmean titres (GMTs) elicited by Synflorix were lower than those elicited by 7-valent Prevenar for the \nseven shared serotypes, except for serotype 19F. \n \nFor serotypes 1, 5 and 7F, the percentages of Synflorix vaccinees reaching an OPA titre ≥ 8 were \nrespectively 65.7%, 90.9% and 99.6% after the primary vaccination course and 91.0%, 96.3% and \n100% after the booster dose. The OPA response for serotypes 1 and 5 was lower in magnitude than the \nresponse for each of the other serotypes. The implications of these findings for protective efficacy are \nnot known. The response to serotype 7F was in the same range as for the seven serotypes in common \nbetween the two vaccines. \n \nIt has also been demonstrated that Synflorix induces an immune response to the cross-reactive \nserotype 19A with 48.8% (95% CI: 42.9; 54.7) of vaccinees reaching an OPA titre ≥ 8 one month after \na booster dose. \n \nThe administration of a fourth dose (booster dose) in the second year of life elicited an anamnestic \nantibody response as measured by ELISA and OPA for the vaccine serotypes and the cross-reactive \nserotype 19A demonstrating the induction of immune memory after the three-dose primary course. \n \nAdditional immunogenicity data \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nInfants from 6 weeks to 6 months of age: \n \n3-dose primary schedule \n \nIn clinical studies the immunogenicity of Synflorix was evaluated after a 3-dose primary vaccination \nseries (6941 subjects) according to different schedules (including 6-10-14 weeks, 2-3-4, 3-4-5 or 2-4-6 \nmonths of age) and after a fourth (booster) dose (5645 subjects) given at least 6 months after the last \nprimary dose and from the age of 9 months onwards. In general, comparable vaccine responses were \nobserved for the different schedules, although somewhat higher immune responses were noted for the \n2-4-6 month schedule. \n \n2-dose primary schedule \n \nIn clinical studies the immunogenicity of Synflorix was evaluated after a 2-dose primary vaccination \nseries (470 subjects) according to different schedules (including 6–14 weeks, 2–4 or 3–5 months of \nage) and after a third (booster) dose (470 subjects) given at least 6 months after the last primary dose \nand from the age of 9 months onwards.  \n \nA clinical study evaluated the immunogenicity of Synflorix in 2-dose or 3-dose primed subjects in \nfour European countries. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups in the \npercentages of subjects with antibody concentration ≥ 0.20 µg/ml (ELISA), the percentages of subjects \nfor serotypes 6B and 23F were lower than for the other vaccine serotypes (Table 7 and Table 8). The \npercentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥ 8 in 2-dose primed subjects compared to 3-dose primed \nsubjects were lower for serotypes 6B, 18C and 23F (74.4%, 82.8%, 86.3% respectively for the 2-dose \nschedule and 88.9%, 96.2%, 97.7% respectively for the 3-dose schedule). Overall, the persistence of \nthe immune response until the booster at 11 months of age was lower in the 2-dose primed subjects. In \nboth schedules, a booster response indicative of immunological priming was observed for each \nvaccine serotype (Table 7 and Table 8). After the booster dose a lower percentage of subjects with \nOPA titres ≥ 8 was observed in the 2-dose schedule for serotypes 5 (87.2% versus 97.5% for the 3-\ndose primed subjects) and 6B (81.1% versus 90.3%), all other responses were comparable. \n \nTable 7: Percentage of 2-dose primed subjects with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20 µg/ml one \nmonth post-primary and one month post-booster \n\nAntibody \n≥ 0.20 µg/ml (ELISA) \n\nPost-primary Post-booster \n% 95% CI % 95% CI \n\nAnti-1 97.4 93.4 99.3 99.4 96.5 100 \nAnti-4 98.0 94.4 99.6 100 97.6 100 \nAnti-5 96.1 91.6 98.5 100 97.6 100 \n\nAnti-6B 55.7 47.3 63.8 88.5 82.4 93.0 \nAnti-7F 96.7 92.5 98.9 100 97.7 100 \nAnti-9V 93.4 88.2 96.8 99.4 96.5 100 \nAnti-14 96.1 91.6 98.5 99.4 96.5 100 \n\nAnti-18C 96.1 91.6 98.5 100 97.7 100 \nAnti-19F 92.8 87.4 96.3 96.2 91.8 98.6 \nAnti-23F 69.3 61.3 76.5 96.1 91.7 98.6 \n\n \nTable 8: Percentage of 3-dose primed subjects with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20 µg/ml one \nmonth post-primary and one month post-booster \n\nAntibody \n≥ 0.20 µg/ml (ELISA) \n\nPost-primary Post-booster \n% 95% CI % 95% CI \n\nAnti-1 98.7 95.3 99.8 100 97.5 100 \nAnti-4 99.3 96.4 100 100 97.5 100 \nAnti-5 100 97.6 100 100 97.5 100 \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAnti-6B 63.1 54.8 70.8 96.6 92.2 98.9 \nAnti-7F 99.3 96.4 100 100 97.5 100 \nAnti-9V 99.3 96.4 100 100 97.5 100 \nAnti-14 100 97.6 100 98.6 95.2 99.8 \n\nAnti-18C 99.3 96.4 100 99.3 96.3 100 \nAnti-19F 96.1 91.6 98.5 98.0 94.2 99.6 \nAnti-23F 77.6 70.2 84.0 95.9 91.3 98.5 \n\n \nFor the cross-reactive serotype 19A, similar ELISA antibody GMCs were observed post-primary and \npost-booster for the 2-dose schedule [0.14 µg/ml (95% CI: 0.12; 0.17) and 0.73 µg/ml (95% CI: 0.58; \n0.92)] and the 3-dose schedule [0.19 µg/ml (95% CI: 0.16; 0.24) and 0.87 µg/ml (95% CI: 0.69; \n1.11)]. The percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥ 8 and GMTs observed post-primary and post-\nbooster were lower in the 2-dose schedule than that in the 3-dose schedule. In both schedules, a \nbooster response indicative of immunological priming was observed. \n \nThe clinical consequences of the lower post-primary and post-booster immune responses observed \nafter the 2-dose primary schedule are not known.  \n \nA clinical study conducted in South Africa assessed the immunogenicity of Synflorix after 3-dose (6-\n10-14 weeks of age) or 2-dose (6-14 weeks of age) priming followed by a booster dose at 9-10 months \nof age. After primary vaccination, for the vaccine serotypes the percentages of subjects reaching \nantibody threshold and with OPA titres ≥ 8 were similar after 2-dose compared to 3-dose except lower \nOPA percentage for serotype 14. The antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were lower after 2-dose for \nmost vaccine serotypes. \n \nFor the cross-reactive serotype 19A, similar percentages of subjects reaching antibody threshold and \nOPA titres ≥ 8 and similar antibody GMC and OPA GMT were observed post-primary in both groups. \nOverall, the pre-booster persistence of immune responses was lower in the 2-dose compared to the  \n3-dose priming group for most vaccine serotypes and was similar for serotype 19A. \n \nBooster dose at 9–10 months of age \n \nIn the study conducted in South Africa, the booster dose given at 9-10 months of age induced marked \nincreases in antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs for each vaccine serotype and serotype 19A in both 2-\ndose and 3-dose priming groups indicative of immunological priming. \n \nBooster dose at 9–12 versus 15–18 months of age \n \nA clinical study conducted in India assessing a booster dose given at 9-12 or 15-18 months of age in \n66 and 71 children, respectively, following primary vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, did not \nsuggest differences between groups in terms of antibody GMCs. Higher OPA GMTs in the group \nboosted at 15-18 months of age were observed for most of the vaccine serotypes and serotype 19A. \nHowever, the clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nImmune memory \n \nIn the follow-up of the European study evaluating the 2-dose and 3-dose primary vaccination \nschedules, the persistence of antibodies at 36–46 months of age was demonstrated in subjects that had \nreceived a 2-dose primary series followed by a booster dose with at least 83.7% of subjects remaining \nseropositive for vaccine serotypes and the cross-reactive serotype 19A. In subjects that had received a \n3-dose primary series followed by a booster dose, at least 96.5% of the subjects remained seropositive \nfor vaccine serotypes and 86.4% for serotype 19A. After a single dose of Synflorix, administered \nduring the 4th year of life, as a challenge dose, the fold increase in ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA \nGMTs, pre to post vaccination, was similar in 2-dose primed subjects to that in 3-dose primed \nsubjects. These results are indicative of immunological memory in primed subjects for all vaccine \nserotypes and the cross-reactive serotype 19A. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nUnvaccinated infants and children ≥ 7 months of age: \n \nThe immune responses elicited by Synflorix in previously unvaccinated older children were evaluated \nin three clinical studies. \n \nThe first clinical study evaluated the immune responses for vaccine serotypes and the cross-reactive \nserotype 19A in children aged 7–11 months, 12–23 months and 2 to 5 years: \n \n\n• Children aged 7–11 months received 2 primary doses followed by a booster dose in the \nsecond year of life. The immune responses after the booster dose in this age group were \ngenerally similar to those observed after the booster dose in infants who had been primed \nwith 3 doses below 6 months of age. \n\n• In children aged 12–23 months, the immune responses elicited after two doses were \ncomparable to the responses elicited after three doses in infants below 6 months of age, \nexcept for vaccine serotypes 18C and 19F as well as serotype 19A for which responses \nwere higher in the 12–23 months children. \n\n• In children aged 2 to 5 years that received 1 dose, the ELISA antibody GMCs were similar \nfor 6 vaccine serotypes as well as serotype 19A than those achieved following a 3-dose \nvaccination schedule in infants below 6 months of age while they were lower for \n4 vaccine serotypes (serotypes 1, 5, 14 and 23F). The OPA GMTs were similar or higher \nfollowing a single dose than a 3-dose primary course in infants below 6 months of age, \nexcept for serotype 5. \n\n  \nIn the second clinical study, a single dose administered four months after two catch-up doses at 12–20 \nmonths of age elicited a marked increase of ELISA GMCs and OPA GMTs (when comparing the \nresponses pre and post the last dose), indicating that two catch-up doses provide adequate priming. \n \nThe third clinical study showed that the administration of 2 doses with a 2 month interval starting at \n36–46 months of age resulted in higher ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs than those observed \none month after a 3-dose primary vaccination for each vaccine serotype and the cross-reactive \nserotype 19A. The proportion of subjects with an ELISA antibody concentration ≥ 0.20 µg/ml or an \nOPA titre ≥ 8 for each vaccine serotype was comparable or higher in the catch-up group than in the 3-\ndose primed infants. \n \nLong-term persistence of antibodies has not been investigated after administration of a primary series \nin infants plus booster or after a 2-dose priming in older children. \n \nIn a clinical study, it has been demonstrated that Synflorix can be safely administered as a booster \ndose in the second year of life to children who had received 3 primary doses of 7-valent Prevenar. This \nstudy has shown that the immune responses against the 7 common serotypes were comparable to those \nelicited by a booster dose of 7-valent Prevenar. However, children who received 7-valent Prevenar for \nthe primary series would not be primed against the additional serotypes contained in Synflorix (1, 5, \n7F). Therefore the degree and duration of protection against invasive pneumococcal disease and otitis \nmedia due to these three serotypes in children of this age group following a single dose of Synflorix \ncannot be predicted. \n \nImmunogenicity data in preterm infants \n \nImmunogenicity of Synflorix in very preterm (gestation period of 27-30 weeks) (N=42), preterm \n(gestation period of 31-36 weeks) (N=82) and full term (gestation period > 36 weeks) (N=132) infants \nwas evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 4, 6 months of age. \nImmunogenicity following a fourth dose (booster dose) at 15 to 18 months of age was evaluated in \n44 very preterm, 69 preterm and 127 full term infants. \n \nOne month after primary vaccination (i.e. after the third dose), for each vaccine serotype at least \n92.7% of subjects achieved ELISA antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20 µg/ml and at least 81.7% achieved \nOPA titres ≥ 8 except serotype 1 (at least 58.8% with OPA titres ≥ 8). Similar antibody GMCs and \n\n\n\n18 \n\nOPA GMTs were observed for all infants except lower antibody GMCs for serotypes 4, 5, 9V and the \ncross-reactive serotype 19A in very preterms and serotype 9V in preterms and lower OPA GMT for \nserotype 5 in very preterms. The clinical relevance of these differences is not known. \n \nOne month after the booster dose increases of ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were seen for \neach vaccine serotype and the cross-reactive serotype 19A, indicative of immunological memory. \nSimilar antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were observed for all infants except a lower OPA GMT for \nserotype 5 in very preterm infants. Overall, for each vaccine serotype at least 97.6% of subjects \nachieved ELISA antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20 µg/ml and at least 91.9% achieved OPA titres ≥ 8. \n \nImmunogenicity in special population \n \nHIV positive (HIV+/+) infants and HIV negative infants born from HIV positive mothers (HIV+/-) \n \nIn a clinical study conducted in South Africa the immunogenicity of Synflorix administered as a \n3-dose primary vaccination course (at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age) followed by a booster dose (at 9 to \n10 months of age) was assessed in 70 HIV positive (HIV+/+) infants, 91 HIV negative infants born \nfrom HIV positive mothers (HIV+/-) and 93 HIV negative infants born from HIV negative mothers  \n(HIV-/-). Only HIV+/+ infants with WHO classification stage 1 (asymptomatic) or 2 (mild symptoms) \nwere to be enrolled. \n \nFor most vaccine serotypes, group comparisons did not suggest any differences in post-primary \nimmune responses between the HIV+/+ and HIV-/- groups, or the HIV+/- and HIV-/- groups, except \nfor a trend towards a lower percentage of subjects reaching OPA titres ≥ 8 and lower OPA GMTs in \nthe HIV+/+ group. The clinical relevance of this lower post-primary OPA response is not known. For \nthe cross-reactive serotype 19A, the results did not suggest any differences in ELISA antibody GMCs \nand OPA GMTs between groups. \n \nThe booster dose of Synflorix in HIV+/+ and HIV+/- infants induced robust increases in ELISA \nantibody GMCs and OPA GMTs for each vaccine serotype and serotype 19A indicative of \nimmunological priming. For most vaccine serotypes and serotype 19A, group comparisons did not \nsuggest any differences post-booster dose in ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs between the \nHIV+/+ and HIV-/- groups, or the HIV+/- and HIV-/- groups. \n \nThe results for protein D suggested comparable post-primary and post-booster immune responses \nbetween groups. \n \nIn each group, persistence of the immune responses was observed at 24–27 months of age, i.e. up to 15 \nmonths following booster vaccination. \n \nChildren with sickle cell disease \n \nA clinical study conducted in Burkina Faso assessed the immunogenicity of Synflorix administered to \n146 children with SCD (haemoglobin SS disease, haemoglobin SC disease or with β-thalassemia) \ncompared to 143 age-matched children without SCD. Among children with SCD, 48 children  \n<6 months of age received primary vaccination at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age, followed by a booster \ndose at 9–10 months of age, 50 children aged 7–11 months and 48 aged 12–23 months started  \ncatch-up vaccination according to their age. The immune response to Synflorix for each of the vaccine \nserotypes and serotype 19A, as well as for protein D, did not appear to be influenced by SCD. \n \nChildren with splenic dysfunction \n \nImmunogenicity and safety of Synflorix were assessed in a limited number of primed or unprimed \nsubjects with congenital or acquired asplenia, splenic dysfunction or complement deficiencies:  \n6 subjects 2–5 years of age and 40 subjects 6–17 years of age (Synflorix is indicated up to 5 years of \nage). Synflorix was shown to be immunogenic and no new safety concerns were observed in this \nstudy. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nImmunogenicity of Synflorix containing the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE) \n \nImmunogenicity of Synflorix containing the preservative 2-PE (presented in a 4-dose container) was \nassessed in healthy infants vaccinated at 6, 10 and 18 weeks of age and compared to those receiving \nSynflorix without added preservative (160 enrolled subjects per group). \n \nImmune responses were compared using non-inferiority criteria in terms of antibody GMC ratio \n(GMC from group of subjects receiving Synflorix without 2-PE over GMC from group of subjects \nreceiving Synflorix with 2-PE) for each of the 10 vaccine serotypes and for the cross-reactive serotype \n19A. \n \nNon-inferiority was demonstrated as the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the antibody GMC ratios \nwas below 2 for each of the 10 vaccine serotypes and for serotype 19A. In addition, OPA GMTs were \nin same ranges for both groups. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nStudies with an 11-valent vaccine formulation representative for Synflorix revealed no special hazard \nfor humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n  \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nSynflorix suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nPneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This vaccine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others.  \n• If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Synflorix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Synflorix \n3. How Synflorix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Synflorix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Synflorix is and what it is used for \n \nSynflorix is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Your doctor or nurse will inject your child with this \nvaccine. \n \nIt is used to help protect your child from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age against: \na bacteria called ‘Streptococcus pneumoniae’. This bacteria can cause serious illnesses including \nmeningitis, sepsis and bacteraemia (bacteria in blood stream) as well as ear infection or pneumonia. \n \nHow Synflorix works \n \nSynflorix helps your body to make its own antibodies. The antibodies form a part of the immune \nsystem that will protect your child against these diseases. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Synflorix \n \nSynflorix should not be given if: \n \n• your child is allergic to the active substance, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine \n\n(listed in section 6). \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, being short of breath and swelling of \nthe face or tongue. \n\n• your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). If this applies to your \nchild then the vaccination will be postponed until your child is feeling better. A minor infection \nsuch as a cold should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nSynflorix should not be given if any of the above applies to your child. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before your child is given Synflorix. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before this vaccine is given if: \n• your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nIn children as of 2 years of age, fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, \ntherefore tell the doctor or nurse if your child fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Synflorix may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated.  \n \nSynflorix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria for which the vaccine has been \ndeveloped.  \n \nChildren with a weakened immune system (such as due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \ninfection or immunosuppressive therapy) may not get the full benefit from Synflorix. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before having Synflorix. \n \nChildren above 5 years old \n \nFor children above 5 years old safety and efficacy of the vaccine have not been established, therefore \nvaccination of these children is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Synflorix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, or if they have recently received any other vaccine. Synflorix may not work as well if your \nchild is taking medicines that affect the immune system to fight infection. \n \nSynflorix can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B, \nmeasles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral rotavirus vaccines as well as meningococcal serogroup C and \nserogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugate vaccines. A different place for the injection will be used for \neach vaccine. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before \nor immediately after Synflorix is given, especially in children being vaccinated with Synflorix and \nvaccines containing whole cell pertussis at the same time. It is also recommended to administer a \nmedicine that lowers fever in children with convulsion disorders or with prior history of febrile \nconvulsions. \nHowever if your child has received paracetamol before or immediately after Synflorix is given, the \nobtained levels of antibodies may be slightly reduced. It is not known whether the reduction in \nantibody levels has an impact on the protection against pneumococcal disease. \n \nSynflorix contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n3. How Synflorix is given \n \nHow the vaccine is given \n \nSynflorix is always injected into a muscle. This is usually in the thigh or upper arm. \n \nHow much is given \n \nUsually, your child (from 6 weeks to 6 months of age) will receive a course of 4 injections according \nto official recommendations or an alternative schedule may be used by the health care professional. It \nis important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse to complete the courses of injections. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n• Each injection will be given at least one month apart except for the last injection (booster), \nwhich will be given at least 6 months after the third injection. \n\n• The first injection may be given from the age of 6 weeks onwards. The last injection (booster) \nmay be given from the age of 9 months onwards. \n\n• You will be told when your child should come back for the next injections. \n \nPreterm infants (born after 27 weeks and less than 37 weeks of pregnancy): \nYour child (from 2 months to 6 months of age) will receive 3 injections with an interval of at least one \nmonth between each dose. At least six months after the last injection, your child will receive an \nadditional injection (booster). \n \nInfants aged 7 to 11 months will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least one month \napart. A third injection (booster) will be given in the second year of life with at least two months apart. \n \nChildren aged 12 months to 5 years will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least two \nmonths apart. \n \nSpecial populations: \nChildren from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age considered to be at a higher risk of pneumococcal \ninfection (such as those with HIV infection, sickle cell disease or impaired or abnormal functioning of \nthe spleen) may receive Synflorix. Please speak to your doctor for information on the number and \ntiming of injections for your child. \n \nIf your child misses an injection \n \nIf your child misses an injection, it is important that you make another appointment. This is so that you \nand your doctor can talk about what steps need to be taken to protect your child. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine: \n \nSevere allergic reactions may very rarely occur (with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine). These \ncan be recognised by: \n- raised and itchy rash (hives) \n- swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n- collapse \nThese reactions will usually occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery. However, if your child gets any \nof these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. \n \nVery common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• pain, redness and swelling where the injection is given \n• high temperature of 38 °C or higher (fever) \n• feeling sleepy \n• feeling irritable \n• loss of appetite \n \nCommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• hardness where the injection is given \n \nUncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine) \n• itching, blood clot, bleeding or a small lump where the injection is given \n\n\n\n46 \n\n• nausea, diarrhoea or feeling sick (vomiting) \n• unusual crying \n• temporarily stopping breathing (apnoea) if your child is born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks \n\nof pregnancy) \n• headache \n• skin rash \n• diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint \n• hives \n \nRare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• fits without temperature or due to high temperature (fever) \n• allergic reactions such as skin allergies \n• collapse (sudden onset of muscle floppiness), periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness, \n\nand paleness or bluish skin discoloration \n \nVery rare ( these may occur with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• Kawasaki disease (major signs of the illness are for instance: fever, skin rash, swollen lymph \n\nglands, inflammation and rash of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat) \n \nBooster doses of Synflorix may increase the risk of side effects. \nFor children > 12 months of age, the risk of pain at the injection site may increase with increasing age. \n \nIn babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between \nbreaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Synflorix \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \n• Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Synflorix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Synflorix is and what it is used for \n \nSynflorix is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Your doctor or nurse will inject your child with this \nvaccine. \n \nIt is used to help protect your child from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age against: \na bacteria called ‘Streptococcus pneumoniae’. This bacteria can cause serious illnesses including \nmeningitis, sepsis and bacteraemia (bacteria in blood stream) as well as ear infection or pneumonia. \n \nHow Synflorix works \n \nSynflorix helps your body to make its own antibodies. The antibodies form a part of the immune \nsystem that will protect your child against these diseases. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Synflorix \n \nSynflorix should not be given if: \n \n• your child is allergic to the active substance, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine \n\n(listed in section 6). \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, being short of breath and swelling of \nthe face or tongue. \n\n• your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). If this applies to your \nchild then the vaccination will be postponed until your child is feeling better. A minor infection \nsuch as a cold should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nSynflorix should not be given if any of the above applies to your child. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before your child is given Synflorix. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before this vaccine is given if: \n• your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nIn children as of 2 years of age, fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, \ntherefore tell the doctor or nurse if your child fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Synflorix may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated.  \n \nSynflorix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria for which the vaccine has been \ndeveloped.  \n \nChildren with a weakened immune system (such as due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \ninfection or immunosuppressive therapy) may not get the full benefit from Synflorix. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before having Synflorix. \n \nChildren above 5 years old \n \nFor children above 5 years old safety and efficacy of the vaccine have not been established, therefore \nvaccination of these children is not recommended. \n  \nOther medicines and Synflorix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, or if they have recently received any other vaccine. Synflorix may not work as well if your \nchild is taking medicines that affect the immune system to fight infection. \n \nSynflorix can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B, \nmeasles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral rotavirus vaccines as well as meningococcal serogroup C and \nserogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugate vaccines. A different place for the injection will be used for \neach vaccine. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before \nor immediately after Synflorix is given, especially in children being vaccinated with Synflorix and \nvaccines containing whole cell pertussis at the same time. It is also recommended to administer a \nmedicine that lowers fever in children with convulsion disorders or with prior history of febrile \nconvulsions. \nHowever if your child has received paracetamol before or immediately after Synflorix is given, the \nobtained levels of antibodies may be slightly reduced. It is not known whether the reduction in \nantibody levels has an impact on the protection against pneumococcal disease. \n \nSynflorix contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How Synflorix is given \n \nHow the vaccine is given \n \nSynflorix is always injected into a muscle. This is usually in the thigh or upper arm. \n \nHow much is given \n \nUsually, your child (from 6 weeks to 6 months of age) will receive a course of 4 injections according \nto official recommendations or an alternative schedule may be used by the health care professional. It \nis important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse to complete the courses of injections. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n• Each injection will be given at least one month apart except for the last injection (booster), \n\nwhich will be given at least 6 months after the third injection. \n• The first injection may be given from the age of 6 weeks onwards. The last injection (booster) \n\nmay be given from the age of 9 months onwards. \n• You will be told when your child should come back for the next injections. \n \nPreterm infants (born after 27 weeks and less than 37 weeks of pregnancy): \nYour child (from 2 months to 6 months of age) will receive 3 injections with an interval of at least one \nmonth between each dose. At least six months after the last injection, your child will receive an \nadditional injection (booster). \n \nInfants aged 7 to 11 months will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least one month \napart. A third injection (booster) will be given in the second year of life with at least two months apart. \n \nChildren aged 12 months to 5 years will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least two \nmonths apart. \n \nSpecial populations: \nChildren from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age considered to be at a higher risk of pneumococcal \ninfection (such as those with HIV infection, sickle cell disease or impaired or abnormal functioning of \nthe spleen) may receive Synflorix. Please speak to your doctor for information on the number and \ntiming of injections for your child. \n \nIf your child misses an injection \n \nIf your child misses an injection, it is important that you make another appointment. This is so that you \nand your doctor can talk about what steps need to be taken to protect your child. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine: \n \nSevere allergic reactions may very rarely occur (with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine). These \ncan be recognised by: \n- raised and itchy rash (hives) \n- swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n- collapse \nThese reactions will usually occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery. However, if your child gets any \nof these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. \n \nVery common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• pain, redness and swelling where the injection is given \n• high temperature of 38° C or higher (fever) \n• feeling sleepy \n• feeling irritable \n• loss of appetite \n \nCommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• hardness where the injection is given \n \nUncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine) \n\n\n\n53 \n\n• itching, blood clot, bleeding or a small lump where the injection is given \n• nausea, diarrhoea or feeling sick (vomiting) \n• unusual crying \n• temporarily stopping breathing (apnoea) if your child is born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks \n\nof pregnancy) \n• headache \n• skin rash \n• diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint \n• hives \n \nRare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• fits without temperature or due to high temperature (fever) \n• allergic reactions such as skin allergies \n• collapse (sudden onset of muscle floppiness), periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness, \n\nand paleness or bluish skin discoloration \n \nVery rare ( these may occur with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• Kawasaki disease (major signs of the illness are for instance: fever, skin rash, swollen lymph \n\nglands, inflammation and rash of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat) \n \nBooster doses of Synflorix may increase the risk of side effects. \nFor children > 12 months of age, the risk of pain at the injection site may increase with increasing age. \n \nIn babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between \nbreaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Synflorix \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \n• Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date \n\nrefers to the last day of that month. \n• Store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C).  \n• Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n• Do not freeze. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before your child is given Synflorix. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before this vaccine is given if: \n• your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily. \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \nIn children as of 2 years of age, fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, \ntherefore tell the doctor or nurse if your child fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Synflorix may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated.  \n \nSynflorix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria for which the vaccine has been \ndeveloped.  \n \nChildren with a weakened immune system (such as due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \ninfection or immunosuppressive therapy) may not get the full benefit from Synflorix. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before having Synflorix. \n \nChildren above 5 years old \n \nFor children above 5 years old safety and efficacy of the vaccine have not been established, therefore \nvaccination of these children is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Synflorix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, or if they have recently received any other vaccine. Synflorix may not work as well if your \nchild is taking medicines that affect the immune system to fight infection. \n \nSynflorix can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B, \nmeasles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral rotavirus vaccines as well as meningococcal serogroup C and \nserogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugate vaccines. A different place for the injection will be used for \neach vaccine. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before \nor immediately after Synflorix is given, especially in children being vaccinated with Synflorix and \nvaccines containing whole cell pertussis at the same time. It is also recommended to administer a \nmedicine that lowers fever in children with convulsion disorders or with prior history of febrile \nconvulsions. \nHowever if your child has received paracetamol before or immediately after Synflorix is given, the \nobtained levels of antibodies may be slightly reduced. It is not known whether the reduction in \nantibody levels has an impact on the protection against pneumococcal disease. \n \nSynflorix contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How Synflorix is given \n \nHow the vaccine is given \n \nSynflorix is always injected into a muscle. This is usually in the thigh or upper arm. \n \nHow much is given \n \nUsually, your child (from 6 weeks to 6 months of age) will receive a course of 4 injections according \nto official recommendations or an alternative schedule may be used by the health care professional. It \nis important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse to complete the courses of injections. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n• Each injection will be given at least one month apart except for the last injection (booster), \n\nwhich will be given at least 6 months after the third injection. \n• The first injection may be given from the age of 6 weeks onwards. The last injection (booster) \n\nmay be given from the age of 9 months onwards. \n• You will be told when your child should come back for the next injections. \n \nPreterm infants (born after 27 weeks and less than 37 weeks of pregnancy): \nYour child (from 2 months to 6 months of age) will receive 3 injections with an interval of at least one \nmonth between each dose. At least six months after the last injection, your child will receive an \nadditional injection (booster). \n \nInfants aged 7 to 11 months will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least one month \napart. A third injection (booster) will be given in the second year of life with at least two months apart. \n \nChildren aged 12 months to 5 years will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least two \nmonths apart. \n \nSpecial populations: \nChildren from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age considered to be at a higher risk of pneumococcal \ninfection (such as those with HIV infection, sickle cell disease or impaired or abnormal functioning of \nthe spleen) may receive Synflorix. Please speak to your doctor for information on the number and \ntiming of injections for your child. \n \nIf your child misses an injection \n \nIf your child misses an injection, it is important that you make another appointment. This is so that you \nand your doctor can talk about what steps need to be taken to protect your child. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine: \n \nSevere allergic reactions may very rarely occur (with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine). These \ncan be recognised by: \n- raised and itchy rash (hives) \n- swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n- collapse \nThese reactions will usually occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery. However, if your child gets any \nof these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. \n \nVery common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• pain, redness and swelling where the injection is given \n• high temperature of 38° C or higher (fever) \n• feeling sleepy \n• feeling irritable \n• loss of appetite \n \nCommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• hardness where the injection is given \n \nUncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine) \n\n\n\n60 \n\n• itching, blood clot, bleeding or a small lump where the injection is given \n• nausea, diarrhoea or feeling sick (vomiting) \n• unusual crying \n• temporarily stopping breathing (apnoea) if your child is born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks \n\nof pregnancy) \n• headache \n• skin rash \n• diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint \n• hives \n \nRare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• fits without temperature or due to high temperature (fever) \n• allergic reactions such as skin allergies \n• collapse (sudden onset of muscle floppiness), periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness, \n\nand paleness or bluish skin discoloration \n \nVery rare ( these may occur with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• Kawasaki disease (major signs of the illness are for instance: fever, skin rash, swollen lymph \n\nglands, inflammation and rash of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat) \n \nBooster doses of Synflorix may increase the risk of side effects. \nFor children > 12 months of age, the risk of pain at the injection site may increase with increasing age. \n \nIn babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between \nbreaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Synflorix \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \n• Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date \n\nrefers to the last day of that month. \n• Store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C).  \n• Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n• Do not freeze. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Synflorix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Synflorix is and what it is used for \n \nSynflorix is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Your doctor or nurse will inject your child with this \nvaccine. \n \nIt is used to help protect your child from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age against: \na bacteria called ‘Streptococcus pneumoniae’. This bacteria can cause serious illnesses including \nmeningitis, sepsis and bacteraemia (bacteria in blood stream) as well as ear infection or pneumonia. \n\n \nHow Synflorix works \n \nSynflorix helps your body to make its own antibodies. The antibodies form a part of the immune \nsystem that will protect your child against these diseases. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Synflorix \n \nSynflorix should not be given if: \n \n• your child is allergic to the active substance, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine \n\n(listed in section 6). \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, being short of breath and swelling of \nthe face or tongue. \n\n• your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). If this applies to your \nchild then the vaccination will be postponed until your child is feeling better. A minor infection \nsuch as a cold should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nSynflorix should not be given if any of the above applies to your child. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before your child is given Synflorix. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before this vaccine is given if: \n• your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nIn children as of 2 years of age, fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, \ntherefore tell the doctor or nurse if your child fainted with a previous injection. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Synflorix may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated.  \n \nSynflorix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria for which the vaccine has been \ndeveloped.  \n \nChildren with a weakened immune system (such as due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \ninfection or immunosuppressive therapy) may not get the full benefit from Synflorix. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before having Synflorix. \n \nChildren above 5 years old \n \nFor children above 5 years old safety and efficacy of the vaccine have not been established, therefore \nvaccination of these children is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Synflorix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, or if they have recently received any other vaccine. Synflorix may not work as well if your \nchild is taking medicines that affect the immune system to fight infection. \n \nSynflorix can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B, \nmeasles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral rotavirus vaccines as well as meningococcal serogroup C and \nserogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugate vaccines. A different place for the injection will be used for \neach vaccine. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before \nor immediately after Synflorix is given, especially in children being vaccinated with Synflorix and \nvaccines containing whole cell pertussis at the same time. It is also recommended to administer a \nmedicine that lowers fever in children with convulsion disorders or with prior history of febrile \nconvulsions. \nHowever if your child has received paracetamol before or immediately after Synflorix is given, the \nobtained levels of antibodies may be slightly reduced. It is not known whether the reduction in \nantibody levels has an impact on the protection against pneumococcal disease. \n \nSynflorix contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How Synflorix is given \n \nHow the vaccine is given \n \nSynflorix is always injected into a muscle. This is usually in the thigh or upper arm. \n \nHow much is given \n \nUsually, your child (from 6 weeks to 6 months of age) will receive a course of 4 injections according \nto official recommendations or an alternative schedule may be used by the health care professional. It \nis important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse to complete the courses of injections. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n• Each injection will be given at least one month apart except for the last injection (booster), \n\nwhich will be given at least 6 months after the third injection. \n• The first injection may be given from the age of 6 weeks onwards. The last injection (booster) \n\nmay be given from the age of 9 months onwards. \n• You will be told when your child should come back for the next injections. \n \nPreterm infants (born after 27 weeks and less than 37 weeks of pregnancy): \nYour child (from 2 months to 6 months of age) will receive 3 injections with an interval of at least one \nmonth between each dose. At least six months after the last injection, your child will receive an \nadditional injection (booster). \n \nInfants aged 7 to 11 months will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least one month \napart. A third injection (booster) will be given in the second year of life with at least two months apart. \n \nChildren aged 12 months to 5 years will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least two \nmonths apart. \n \nSpecial populations: \nChildren from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age considered to be at a higher risk of pneumococcal \ninfection (such as those with HIV infection, sickle cell disease or impaired or abnormal functioning of \nthe spleen) may receive Synflorix. Please speak to your doctor for information on the number and \ntiming of injections for your child. \n \nIf your child misses an injection \n \nIf your child misses an injection, it is important that you make another appointment.

Do not administer intravascularly. \n \nIf Synflorix is co-administered with other vaccines, different injection sites should be used. \n \nSynflorix should not be mixed with other vaccines. If a vaccine dose is withdrawn into a syringe for \ninjection, the needle used for withdrawal must be replaced by a needle suitable for intramuscular \ninjection. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
