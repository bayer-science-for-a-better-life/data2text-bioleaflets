NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDesloratadine Actavis 5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 5 mg desloratadine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nBlue coloured, round, with diameter of 6 mm, biconvex, film-coated tablets with the marking \u2018LT\u2019 \nengraved on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDesloratadine Actavis is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for the relief of \nsymptoms associated with: \n- allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1) \n- urticaria (see section 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and over)  \nThe recommended dose of Desloratadine Actavis is one tablet once a day. \n \nIntermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than \n4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient\u2019s disease history and the \ntreatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. \nIn persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than \n4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents \n12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Desloratadine Actavis 5 mg film-coated tablets in children below the age of \n12 years have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \nOral use. \nThe dose can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn the case of severe renal insufficiency, desloratadine should be used with caution (see section 5.2). \n \nDesloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of \nseizures, and mainly young children, being more susceptible to develop new seizures under \ndesloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in patients \nwho experience a seizure while on treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which \nerythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nIn a clinical pharmacology trial, desloratadine tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not \npotentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol \nintolerance and intoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is \nrecommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of desloratadine during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDesloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of \ndesloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from desloratadine therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data available on male and female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDesloratadine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical \ntrials. Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as \nthere is individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are \nadvised not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, \nuntil they have established their own response to the medicinal product. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at \nthe recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with desloratadine were reported in 3% of \npatients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse reactions reported in \nexcess of placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \nIn a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse \nevent was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of patients \nreceiving placebo. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other \nundesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with desloratadine \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nNot known Increased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very rare \nNot known \n\nHallucinations \nAbnormal behaviour, aggression \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nCommon \nVery rare \n\nHeadache \nDizziness, somnolence, insomnia, \npsychomotor hyperactivity, seizures \n\nCardiac disorders Very rare \nNot known \n\nTachycardia, palpitations \nQT prolongation \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon \nVery rare \n\nDry mouth \nAbdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ndyspepsia, diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very rare \n \n\nNot known \n\nElevations of liver enzymes, increased \nbilirubin, hepatitis \nJaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nNot known Photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery rare Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon \nVery rare \n\n \n \n\nNot known \n\nFatigue \nHypersensitivity reactions (such as \nanaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnoea, \npruritus, rash, and urticaria) \nAsthenia \n\nInvestigations Not known Weight increased \n \nPaediatric population \nOther undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric patients with an \nunknown frequency included QT prolongation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, abnormal behaviour, and \naggression. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n5 \n\n \nTreatment \nIn the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. \nSymptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. \n \nDesloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal \ndialysis. \n \nSymptoms \nBased on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered \n(nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines \u2013 H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06A X27 \n \nMechanism of action \nDesloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor \nantagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine \nH1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system. \n \nDesloratadine has demonstrated anti-allergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting \nthe release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast \ncells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on \nendothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for \n14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical \npharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the \nclinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen. \n \nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose \nketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials. \n \nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to \nplacebo. Desloratadine given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance \nin clinical trials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard \nmeasures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to \nflying. \n \nIn clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced \nimpairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the \npsychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or \nwith alcohol. \n \nIn patients with allergic rhinitis, desloratadine was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, \nnasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate. \nDesloratadine effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of desloratadine tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent \npatients 12 through 17 years of age. \n \nIn addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can \nalternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to \nthe duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less \nthan 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of \nsymptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks. \n \nDesloratadine was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total \nscore of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in the \ndomains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. \n \nChronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the \nunderlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be \nmore easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, \ndesloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, \nin addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines. \n \nIn two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadine \nwas effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first \ndosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with other \nantihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as non-\nresponsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50% was \nobserved in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19% of patients treated with \nplacebo. Treatment with desloratadine also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime \nfunction, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nDesloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of administration. \nDesloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; the \nterminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine was \nconsistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and a once daily dosing frequency. The \nbioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg. \n \nIn a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general \nseasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of \ndesloratadine. This percentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine \nconcentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of \napproximately 89 hours. The safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general \npopulation. \n \nDistribution \nDesloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to \n20 mg) for 14 days. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, \nsome interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not \ninhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit \nCYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. \n \nElimination \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high \ncaloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect \non the disposition of desloratadine. \n \nRenally impaired patients \nThe pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was \ncompared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the \nsingle-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects \nwith mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose \nstudy, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to \ndesloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in \nsubjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and \n3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDesloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in \nthe toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Desloratadine Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Desloratadine Actavis is \nDesloratadine Actavis contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. \n \nHow Desloratadine Actavis works \nDesloratadine Actavis is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your \nallergic reaction and its symptoms. \n \nWhen Desloratadine Actavis should be used \nDesloratadine Actavis relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal \npassages caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and \nadolescents 12 years of age and older. These symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy \npalate, and itchy, red or watery eyes. \n \nDesloratadine Actavis is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with urticaria (a skin condition \ncaused by an allergy). These symptoms include itching and hives. \n \nRelief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and \nsleep. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Desloratadine Actavis \n \nDo not take Desloratadine Actavis: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to desloratadine, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) or to loratadine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Desloratadine Actavis: \n\u2022 if you have poor kidney function. \n\u2022 if you have medical or familial history of seizures. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nUse in children and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children less than 12 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Desloratadine Actavis \nThere are no known interactions of Desloratadine Actavis with other medicines. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDesloratadine Actavis with food, drink and alcohol \nDesloratadine Actavis may be taken with or without a meal. \nUse caution when taking Desloratadine Actavis with alcohol. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nTaking Desloratadine Actavis is not recommended if you are pregnant or nursing a baby. \nFertility \nThere is no data available on male/female fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAt the recommended dose, this medicine is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use \nmachines. Although most people do not experience drowsiness, it is recommended not to engage in \nactivities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating machinery until you have \nestablished your own response to the medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Desloratadine Actavis \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nAdults and adolescents 12 years of age and over \nThe recommended dose is one tablet once a day with water, with or without food. \n \nThis medicine is for oral use. \nSwallow the tablet whole. \n \nRegarding the duration of treatment, your doctor will determine the type of allergic rhinitis you are \nsuffering from and will determine for how long you should take Desloratadine Actavis. \nIf your allergic rhinitis is intermittent (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less \nthan 4 weeks), your doctor will recommend you a treatment schedule that will depend on the \nevaluation of the history of your disease. \nIf your allergic rhinitis is persistent (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more \nthan 4 weeks), your doctor may recommend you a longer term treatment. \n \nFor urticaria, the duration of treatment may be variable from patient to patient and therefore you \nshould follow the instructions of your doctor. \n \nIf you take more Desloratadine Actavis than you should \nTake Desloratadine Actavis only as it is prescribed for you. No serious problems are expected with \naccidental overdose. However, if you take more Desloratadine Actavis than you were told to, tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Desloratadine Actavis \nIf you forget to take your dose on time, take it as soon as possible and then go back to your regular \ndosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIf you stop taking Desloratadine Actavis \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nDuring the marketing of desloratadine, cases of severe allergic reactions (difficulty in breathing, \nwheezing, itching, hives and swelling) have been reported very rarely. If you notice any of these \nserious side effects, stop taking the medicine and seek urgent medical advice straight away. \n \nIn clinical studies in adults, side effects were about the same as with a dummy tablet.
