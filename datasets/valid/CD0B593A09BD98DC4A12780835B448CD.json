PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for suspension for injection \n \nPrior to reconstitution, the vaccine is a white, homogenous, freeze-dried powder with possible \nretraction at the base (ring-shaped cake possible). \n \nThe solvent is a clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nDengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 \nand 4 in individuals 9 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe use of Dengvaxia should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n \nPosology \n \nChildren and adults 9 to 45 years of age \n \nThe vaccination schedule consists of 3 injections of one reconstituted dose (0.5 mL) to be \nadministered at 6-month intervals. \n \nOther paediatric population \n \nDengvaxia should not be used in children less than 9 years of age (see sections 4.8).  \nIn vaccinees 2 to 8 years of age with no previous dengue infection, long-term safety follow-up data \nshowed an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalisation including clinically severe \ndengue. Available data are not sufficient to confirm the safety and efficacy in individuals previously \ninfected by any dengue virus and younger than 9 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPrevious dengue infection has to be assessed before vaccination by laboratory confirmed history of \ndengue or through an appropriately validated serological test (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous (SC) injection preferably in the upper arm in the \nregion of deltoid. \n \nDo not administer by intravascular injection. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Dengvaxia before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or after \n\nprior administration of Dengvaxia or a vaccine containing the same components. \n \n\u2022 Individuals with congenital or acquired cell-mediated immune deficiency, including \n\nimmunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids \n(e.g. 20mg or 2mg/kg of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. \n\n \n\u2022 Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection when \n\naccompanied by evidence of impaired immune function. \n \n\u2022 Pregnant women (see section 4.6). \n \n\u2022 Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nProtection \n \nA protective immune response with Dengvaxia may not be elicited in all vaccinees. It is recommended \nto continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. \n \nSpecial patient groups \n \nIndividuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus or for whom this information is \nunknown \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nIndividuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus or for whom this information is \nunknown should not be vaccinated because an increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue and \nclinically severe dengue (predominantly grade 1 or 2 Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever) has been observed \nin these individuals during the long-term follow up of clinical trials (see Section 4.8). \n \nIn the absence of documented prior dengue virus infection, previous infection has to be confirmed by \nserotesting before vaccination. To avoid vaccination of false positives, only test methods with \nadequate performance in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity based on the local disease \nepidemiology should be used.  \n \nTravellers \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support vaccination of individuals living in \nnon-endemic areas and travelling to endemic areas, therefore vaccination of these individuals is not \nrecommended.  \n \nOutbreaks \n \nDengvaxia should not be used in the context of dengue outbreak in non-endemic regions. \n \nOthers \n \nAdministration of Dengvaxia must be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe \nfebrile or acute disease. \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the individual's medical history (in particular, previous \nvaccinations and possible adverse reactions which occurred after vaccination). \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an \nanaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \ninjection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling and to manage \nsyncopal reactions. \n \nThe tip caps of the prefilled syringes contain a natural rubber latex derivative, which may cause \nallergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during at least one month after \neach dose (see section 4.6). \n \nDengvaxia must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances. \n \nDengvaxia contains phenylalanine, sodium and sorbitol \n \nDengvaxia contains 41 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be \nharmful for people with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds \nup because the body cannot remove it properly. \n \nDengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \nDengvaxia contains 9.38 milligrams of sorbitol in each 0.5 ml dose. \n \nTraceability \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nFor patients receiving treatment with immunoglobulins or blood products containing \nimmunoglobulins, such as blood or plasma, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 weeks, and \npreferably for 3 months, following the end of treatment before administering Dengvaxia, in order to \navoid neutralization of the attenuated viruses contained in the vaccine. \n \nDengvaxia should not be administered to subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as \nchemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to vaccination (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nAs there are no data on co-administration of Dengvaxia vaccine with other vaccines for the population \nfrom 9 years and above, the concomitant use of Dengvaxia with other vaccines is not recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Dengvaxia in pregnant women. These data are not \nsufficient to conclude on the absence of potential effects of Dengvaxia on pregnancy, embryo-foetal \ndevelopment, parturition and post-natal development. \n \nDengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine, therefore Dengvaxia is contraindicated during pregnancy (see \nsection 4.3). \n  \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during at least one month after \neach dose. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to lactation. \nThere is very limited experience on dengue virus excretion via breast milk. \nAlso, considering that Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine and that there is very limited experience \nfrom post marketing data with Dengvaxia in lactating women, the vaccine is contraindicated during \nlactation (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies have been performed on fertility. \nAnimal studies did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nDengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na.  Summary of the safety profile \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nIn subjects 9 to 45 years of age, the most frequently reported reactions whatever the dengue serostatus \nprior to vaccination, were headache (54%), injection site pain (49%), malaise (44%), myalgia (43%), \nasthenia (34%), and fever (16%). \n \nAdverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination except fever which appears within 14 \ndays after the injection. The adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity and of short \nduration (0 to 3 days). \n \nSystemic adverse reactions tended to be less frequent after the second and third injections of \nDengvaxia as compared to the first injection. \n \nAllergic including anaphylactic reactions have been reported very rarely. \n \nOverall, the same adverse reactions but at lower frequencies were observed in dengue seropositive \nsubjects. \nb.  Tabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories:  \nVery common: \u2265 1/10 \nCommon: \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon: \u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100 \nRare: \u2265 1/10 000 to < 1/1000 \nVery rare: (<1/10 000) \n \nAdverse reactions collected within 28 days after any injection during clinical studies from 9 to 45 \nyears of age, on a reactogenicity subset of 1306 adults and 3067 children, and adverse reactions \nobserved during commercial use are presented in Table 1 for children 9 to 17 years old and in Table 2 \nfor adults 18 to 45 years old.  \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions from Clinical Studies and reported during commercial use in \nchildren (9 to 17 years old) \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nSystem Organ Class  Frequency  Adverse Events  \nInfections and infestations  Rare Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nImmune system disorders Very rare Allergic including anaphylactic reactions* \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Headache \nRare  Dizziness \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nRare  Oropharyngeal pain \nCough \nRhinorrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Rare  Nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Urticaria \nRare  Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nRare  Neck pain \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Injection site pain \nMalaise \nAsthenia \nFever \n\nCommon Injection site reactions (erythema, swelling) \nUncommon Injection site reactions (hematoma, pruritus) \n\nInjection site induration \n* Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions from Clinical Studies and reported during commercial use in adults \n(18 to 45 years old) \n \n\nSystem Organ Class  Frequency  Adverse Events  \nInfections and infestations  Uncommon Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nNasopharyngitis \nBlood and lymphatic \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Lymphadenopathy \n\nImmune system disorders Very rare Allergic including anaphylactic reactions* \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Headache \nUncommon Dizziness \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Oropharyngeal pain \nCough \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea \nDry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Rash \nRash generalised \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nUncommon Neck pain \n\nArthralgia \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Injection site pain \nMalaise \nAsthenia \n\nCommon Fever \nInjection site reactions (erythema, hematoma, \nswelling, pruritus) \n\nUncommon Injection site induration \nInjection site warmth \nChills \nFatigue \n\n* Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. \n \nc.  Hospitalised and/or clinically severe dengue fever in long-term safety follow-up data \n \nIn an exploratory analysis of the long-term follow up from the first injection in three efficacy studies, \nan increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue including clinically severe dengue (predominantly \nDengue Haemorrhagic Fever grade 1 or 2 [WHO 1997]) has been observed in vaccinees with no \nprevious dengue infection. Over a period of 6 years, in subjects with no previous dengue infection, the \nrisk of severe dengue is increased by 2.41 fold (95% CI: 0.50; 11.75) in subjects 9 to 16 years of age \nvaccinated with Dengvaxia as compared to non-vaccinated subjects in the same age group. In subjects \n9 years of age or older, it was estimated that during a 6 year follow-up about 5 additional hospitalized \ndengue cases or 3 additional severe dengue cases per 1000 vaccinees with no previous dengue \ninfection could occur following vaccination. Estimates from the long-term analysis suggest the onset \nof increased risk was mainly during the 3rd year following the first injection.  \nThis increased risk was not observed in individuals who have been previously infected by dengue \nvirus, where it was estimated that 16 hospitalized dengue cases or 4 severe dengue cases could be \nprevented per 1000 vaccinees with previous dengue infection during 6 years of follow up from the first \ninjection. \n \nThe estimations described above for a 6 year period are derived from data obtained in the pivotal \nclinical trials in countries with a particular dengue seroprevalence and epidemiological context. These \nfigures may not be extrapolated to other regions with different seroprevalence and epidemiological \nsituations. \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n \nd.  Paediatric population \n \nPaediatric data in subjects 9 to 17 years of age \n \nIn paediatric population, fever has been observed with a higher frequency (very common) than in \nadults (common). \n \nUrticaria (uncommon) was only reported in subjects 9 to 17 years of age (none in adults). \n \nPaediatric data in subjects below 9 years of age, i.e., outside the age indication \n \nThe reactogenicity subset in subjects below 9 years of age includes 2960 subjects as follows: 1287 \nsubjects below 2 years of age, 905 subjects between 2 and 5 years of age and 768 subjects between 6 \nand 8 years of age. \n \nIn subjects 2 to 8 years of age, as compared to subjects above 9 years of age, injection site erythema \nand swelling were more frequently reported (frequency: very common), and additional adverse events \nwere reported (frequency: uncommon): injection site haemorrhage, decreased appetite and vomiting. \n \nIn subjects 2 to 8 years of age, with no previous dengue infection, long-term safety follow-up data \nshowed an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalisation including clinically severe \ndengue in vaccinated subjects as compared to non-vaccinated subjects. \n \nIn subjects below 2 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions following any \ninjection of Dengvaxia were fever, irritability, appetite lost, abnormal crying and injection site \ntenderness. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX/ Not Yet assigned \n \n1. Mechanism of action \n \nDengvaxia contains live attenuated viruses. Following administration, the viruses replicate locally and \nelicit neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses against the four dengue virus \nserotypes (see detailed data below, subsection 3). \n \n2. Clinical efficacy \n \nThe clinical efficacy of Dengvaxia was assessed in 3 studies: one supportive Phase IIb efficacy study \n(CYD23) in Thailand, and 2 pivotal large-scale Phase III efficacy studies, CYD14 in Asia (Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and CYD15 in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, \nHonduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 10 \n\n \nThe Control Group in dengue studies was defined as subjects who received at least one injection of \nplacebo or comparator vaccine. \n \nIn the Phase IIb study, a total of 4002 subjects aged 4 to 11 years were randomised to receive \nDengvaxia or a control, regardless of previous dengue infection. Efficacy in subjects 9 to 11 years of \nage was assessed in 1554 subjects (1032 in vaccine group and 522 in Control Group). \n \nIn the two pivotal Phase III studies (CYD14 and CYD15), a total of approximately 31000 subjects \naged 2 to 16 years were randomised to receive either Dengvaxia or placebo, regardless of previous \ndengue infection. Efficacy in subjects 9 years of age and older was assessed in 17 230 subjects who \nreceived Dengvaxia (3316 subjects in CYD14 and 13914 in CYD15) and 8596 subjects who received \nplacebo (1656 in CYD14 and 6940 in CYD15). \n \nAt the start of the CYD14 and CYD15 trials, dengue seroprevalence for the overall population at the \ntrial sites ranged from 52.8%-81.1% in CYD14 (Asia-Pacific) and 55.7%-92.7% in CYD15 (Latin \nAmerica). \n \nThe efficacy was assessed during an Active Phase of 25 months, in which surveillance was designed \nto maximize the detection of all symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases regardless \nof the severity. The active detection of symptomatic dengue cases started on the day of the first \ninjection and lasted until each subject had been followed for at least 13 months after the third \ninjection. This phase includes therefore the primary endpoint observation period from 28 days after the \nthird injection up to the end of the Active Phase. \n \nFor the primary endpoint, the incidence of symptomatic VCD cases occurring during the 12-month \nperiod from 28 days after the third injection was compared to the Control Group. \n \nExploratory vaccine efficacy analyses according to dengue serostatus measured by plaque reduction \nneutralization test (PRNT50) at baseline (before the first injection) were performed in the \nimmunogenicity subset of 2000 subjects each in CYD14 and CYD15 and 300 subjects in CYD23. Of \nthe 2930 subjects 9 to 16 years old in this subset (approximately 80%) who were dengue seropositive \nat baseline, 1974 subjects received the vaccine (901 subjects in CYD14 and 1073 in CYD15) and 956 \nsubjects received placebo (444 in CYD14 and 512 in CYD15) (see also subsection 3). \n \n \n2.1 Clinical efficacy data for subjects 9 to 16 years of age in endemic areas, any serostatus at \nbaseline \n \nThe Vaccine Efficacy (VE) results according to the primary endpoint (symptomatic VCD cases \noccurring during the 12-month period starting from 28 days after the third injection) in subjects 9 to 16 \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nyears of age (any serostatus at baseline) are shown in Table 3 for studies CYD14, CYD15 and \nCYD23. \n \nTable 3: VE against symptomatic VCD cases over the 12-month period starting from 28 days \nafter the third injection due to any of the 4 serotypes in subjects 9 to 16 years (any serostatus at \nbaseline). \n \n\n \n\nCYD14 CYD15 CYD23 Pooled CYD14+CYD15 \n\nPooled* \nCYD14+CYD15+ \n\nCYD23 \n\n Vaccine group \nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nCases / \nperson-\nyears \n\n34 / \n3199 \n\n55 / \n1585 \n\n185 / \n12458 \n\n236 / \n6157 \n\n6 / \n1033 \n\n10 / \n514 \n\n219 / \n15657 \n\n291 / \n7742 \n\n225 / \n16690 \n\n301 / \n8256 \n\nVE % \n(95%CI) \n\n69.4  \n(52.2; 80.6) \n\n61.3  \n(52.8; 68.2) \n\n70.1 \n(9.3; 91.1) \n\n62.8  \n(55.7; 68.8) \n\n63.0 \n(56.1; 68.9) \n\nN: number of subjects per study \nCases: number of subjects with at least one symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue episode in the considered period. \nPerson-years: sum of time-at-risk (in years) for the subjects during the study period. \nCI: confidence interval. \n*Pooled results of CYD14, 15 and 23 need to be interpreted cautiously because of differences in the Dengue confirmatory \ntest and acute febrile illness definition between CYD14/15 and CYD23. \n \nIn subjects 9 to 16 years of age, the efficacy of Dengvaxia against symptomatic virologically-\nconfirmed dengue (VCD) cases due to any of the 4 serotypes was demonstrated in all three studies, \nCYD14, CYD15 and CYD23 (see Table 3). \n \nThe Vaccine Efficacy (VE) against symptomatic VCD, severe and hospitalised VCD during the 25-\nmonth period after the first injection, which were secondary objectives, in subjects 9 to 16 years of age \nare shown in Table 4 for any serostatus at baseline for studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23.

Four hospitalized VCD cases in CYD14 and two hospitalized VCD cases in \nCYD15 were reported in the control group versus none in the vaccine group. These data are \ninconclusive due to the low number of cases in the immunogenicity subset. However, the extrapolated \nvaccine efficacy (1- Hazard Ratio), obtained from an exploratory analysis (pooled CYD14 + CYD15 + \nCYD23) over 25-month period after the first injection, is estimated at 89.2% (95% CI: 78.5; 94.6) for \nhospitalized VCD and 95.3% (95% CI: 68.9; 99.3) for severe VCD. \n \n2.3 Clinical efficacy data for subjects 17 to 45 years of age in endemic areas \n \nNo clinical efficacy study has been done in subjects from 17 to 45 years from endemic areas. The \nclinical efficacy of the vaccine is based on bridging of immunogenicity data (see below section 3.2). \n \n2.4 Other paediatric data from efficacy studies in subjects 2 through 8 years of age, i.e., outside the \nage indication \n \nEfficacy in subjects 2 to 8 years of age was assessed in 2443 subjects (1634 in vaccine group and 809 \nin control group) in phase IIb study and in 5300 subjects (3532 subjects in vaccine group and 1768 in \ncontrol group) in the pivotal Phase III study (CYD14). Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic VCD \ncases over the 12-month  period starting from 28 days after the third injection due to any of the 4 \nserotypes was 40.5% (95% CI: 22.7; 54.2) (pooled CYD14+CYD23). Vaccine Efficacy against \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nsymptomatic, severe and hospitalized VCD during the 25-month period after the first injection due to \nany serotype (pooled CYD14+CYD23), was respectively 42.2% (95% CI: 30.6; 51.8), 45.1% (95% \nCI: 29.3; 76.7),  47.6% (95% CI: 23.7; 64.0).  \n \n2.5 Long-term protection \n \nDuring a period of 6 years after the first injection, in subjects 9 years of age and above with previous \ndengue infection, the extrapolated vaccine efficacy (1-Hazard Ratio)*100 (obtained from an \nexploratory analysis) is estimated at 80 (95% CI: 69; 87) for hospitalized VCD and 84 (95% CI: 61; \n94) for severe VCD. \n \n3. Immunogenicity \n \nDuring clinical development, immunogenicity data were collected in a total of approximately \n5700 subjects 9 months to 60 years of age that received at least one injection of the vaccine. \n \nAmong these 5700 subjects, a total of 3104 subjects 9 to 45 years of age from endemic areas received \nat least one injection of Dengvaxia. Most of the subjects were 9 to 17 years of age (n= 2810). \n \nDuring clinical development, neutralizing antibody titres for each serotype were measured with the \nplaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and presented as geometric mean titres (GMTs). \nAn association between levels of post-injection 3 geometric mean titres (GMTs) and the probability of \nthe disease has been demonstrated in efficacy studies. \nHigher titres post-injection 3 are associated with a lower risk of dengue disease and higher vaccine \nefficacy, although an immunological correlate of protection has not been established. \n \nIn the following Tables the dengue serostatus at baseline (before the first injection), was defined as:  \n\u2022 Dengue seropositivity if the PRNT50 titre \u2265 10 [1/dil] (the lower limit of quantification, \n\nLLOQ), against at least one serotype. \n\u2022 Dengue seronegativity if the PRNT50 titre < the lower limit of quantification against any of the \n\n4 serotypes. \n \n3.1 Immunogenicity data for subjects 9 to 17 years of age in endemic areas \n \nThe post dose 3 GMTs in subjects 9 to 16 years of age in CYD14 and CYD15 are shown in the Table \n6. \n \nTable 6: Immunogenicity for dengue seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years of age in CYD14 and \nCYD15 from endemic areas  \n \n  Serotype 1 Serotype 2 Serotype 3 Serotype 4 \n\nStudy N \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost-\ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nCYD14 485 \n167 \n\n(138; 202) \n\n437 \n\n(373; 511) \n\n319 \n\n(274; 373) \n\n793 \n\n(704; 892) \n\n160 \n\n(135; 190) \n\n443 \n\n(387; 507) \n\n83.8 \n\n(72.0; 97.6) \n\n272 \n\n(245; 302) \n\nCYD15 1048 \n278 \n\n(247; 313) \n\n703 \n\n(634; 781) \n\n306 \n\n(277; 338) \n\n860 \n\n(796; 930) \n\n261 \n\n(235; 289) \n\n762 \n\n(699; 830) \n\n73.3 \n\n(66.6; 80.7) \n\n306 \n\n(286; 328) \nN: number of subjects with available antibody titre for the relevant endpoint \nDengue seropositive subjects are subjects with titres above or equal to LLOQ against at least one dengue serotype at baseline \nCI: Confidence Interval \nCYD14: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam. \nCYD15: Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico. \n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \n3.2 Immunogenicity data for subjects 18 to 45 years of age in endemic areas \n \nThe immunogenicity of the final formulation of the CYD dengue vaccine in adults aged 18 to 45 years \nin endemic areas was assessed in 3 studies conducted all in Asia-Pacific (CYD22 in Vietnam, CYD28 \nin Singapore and CYD47 in India). \nThe GMTs post-dose 3 in subjects 18 to 45 years of age are shown in the Table 7 \n \nTable 7: Immunogenicity for dengue seropositive subjects 18 to 45 years of age from endemic \nareas  \n \n\n  Serotype 1 Serotype 2 Serotype 3 Serotype 4 \n\nStudy N \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT  \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT  \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost-\ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost-\ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nCYD22 19 \n408 \n\n(205; 810) \n\n785 \n\n(379; 1626) \n\n437 \n\n(240; 797) \n\n937 \n\n(586; 1499) \n\n192 \n\n(117; 313) \n\n482 \n\n(357; 651) \n\n86.5 \n\n(41.2; 182) \n\n387 \n\n(253; 591) \n\nCYD28 66 \n59.8 \n\n(36.8;97.4) \n\n235 \n\n(135; 409) \n\n67.1 \n\n(40.9; 110) \n\n236 \n\n(144; 387) \n\n48.4 \n\n(32.9;71.0) \n\n239 \n\n(166; 342) \n\n22.1 \n\n(14.7;33.4) \n\n211 \n\n(155; 287) \n\nCYD47 109 \n324 \n\n(236; 445) \n\n688 \n\n(524; 901) \n\n363 \n\n(269; 490) \n\n644 \n\n(509; 814) \n\n394 \n\n(299; 519) \n\n961 \n\n(763;1211) \n\n80.7 \n\n(613; 106) \n\n413 \n\n(331; 516) \nN: number of subjects with available antibody titre for the relevant endpoint \nDengue seropositive subjects are subjects with titres above or equal to LLOQ against at least one dengue serotype at baseline \nCI: Confidence Interval \nCYD28: Low endemic country \nCYD22: Vietnam; CYD28: Singapore; CYD47: India; \n \nThe bridging of efficacy is based on above available data and overall results. Immunogenicity data \navailable from studies in adults aged 18 to 45 years in endemic regions show that post-injection 3 \nGMTs against each serotype are generally higher in adults than in children and adolescents in CYD14 \nand CYD15. Therefore, protection is expected in adults in endemics areas although the actual \nmagnitude of efficacy relative to that observed in children and adolescents is unknown. \n \n3.3 Long-term persistence of antibodies \n \nA decrease in the GMTs against all 4 serotypes was observed one year after the third injection. Then, \nGMTs stabilize over the next 2 to 4 years and remain superior to pre-vaccination GMTs. The GMTs \nlevels depend on age and dengue serostatus at baseline. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been performed on Dengvaxia. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical safety data revealed no special risks for humans based on a repeated-dose toxicity \nincluding assessment of local tolerance, and a developmental and reproductive toxicology program. \nThere was no shedding of Dengvaxia RNA in a distribution and shedding study, hence no risk of \ndissemination to the environment or transmission from vaccinees. A neurovirulence study shows that \nCYD dengue vaccine is not neurotoxic. \n \n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for suspension for injection \n \nPrior to reconstitution, the vaccine is a white, homogenous, freeze-dried powder with possible \nretraction at the base (ring-shaped cake possible). \n \nThe solvent is a limpid, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nDengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 \nand 4 in individuals 9 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe use of Dengvaxia should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n \nPosology \n \nChildren and adults 9 to 45 years of age \n \nThe vaccination schedule consists of 3 injections of one reconstituted dose (0.5 mL) to be \nadministered at 6-month intervals. \n \nOther paediatric population \n \nDengvaxia should not be used in children less than 9 years of age (see sections 4.8).  \nIn vaccinees 2 to 8 years of age with no previous dengue infection, long-term safety follow-up data \nshowed an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalisation including clinically severe \ndengue. Available data are not sufficient to confirm the safety and efficacy in individuals previously \ninfected by any dengue virus and younger than 9 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPrevious dengue infection has to be assessed before vaccination by laboratory confirmed history of \ndengue or through an appropriately validated serological test (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous (SC) injection preferably in the upper arm in the \nregion of deltoid. \n \nDo not administer by intravascular injection.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Dengvaxia before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or after \n\nprior administration of Dengvaxia or a vaccine containing the same components. \n \n\u2022 Individuals with congenital or acquired cell-mediated immune deficiency, including \n\nimmunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids \n(e.g. 20mg or 2mg/kg of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. \n\n \n\u2022 Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection when \n\naccompanied by evidence of impaired immune function. \n \n\u2022 Pregnant women (see section 4.6). \n \n\u2022 Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nProtection \n \nA protective immune response with Dengvaxia may not be elicited in all vaccinees. It is recommended \nto continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. \n \nSpecial patient groups \n \nIndividuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus or for whom this information is \nunknown \n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nIndividuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus or for whom this information is \nunknown should not be vaccinated because an increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue and \nclinically severe dengue (predominantly grade 1 or 2 Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever) has been observed \nin these individuals during the long-term follow up of clinical trials (see Section 4.8). \n \nIn the absence of documented prior dengue virus infection, previous infection has to be confirmed by \nserotesting before vaccination. To avoid vaccination of false positives, only test methods with \nadequate performance in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity based on the local disease \nepidemiology should be used.  \n \nTravellers \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support vaccination of individuals living in \nnon-endemic areas and travelling to endemic areas, therefore vaccination of these individuals is not \nrecommended.  \n \nOutbreaks \n \nDengvaxia should not be used in the context of dengue outbreak in non-endemic regions. \n \nOthers \n \nAdministration of Dengvaxia must be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe \nfebrile or acute disease. \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the individual's medical history (in particular, previous \nvaccinations and possible adverse reactions which occurred after vaccination). \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an \nanaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \ninjection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling and to manage \nsyncopal reactions. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during at least one month after \neach dose (see section 4.6). \n \nDengvaxia must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances. \n \nDengvaxia contains phenylalanine, sodium and sorbitol \n \nDengvaxia contains 8 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be \nharmful for people with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds \nup because the body cannot remove it properly. \n \nDengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \nDengvaxia contains 1.76 milligrams of sorbitol in each 0.5 ml dose. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \nFor patients receiving treatment with immunoglobulins or blood products containing \nimmunoglobulins, such as blood or plasma, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 weeks, and \npreferably for 3 months, following the end of treatment before administering Dengvaxia, in order to \navoid neutralization of the attenuated viruses contained in the vaccine. \n \nDengvaxia should not be administered to subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as \nchemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to vaccination (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nAs there are no data on co-administration of Dengvaxia vaccine with other vaccines for the population \nfrom 9 years and above, the concomitant use of Dengvaxia with other vaccines is not recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Dengvaxia in pregnant women. These data are not \nsufficient to conclude on the absence of potential effects of Dengvaxia on pregnancy, embryo-foetal \ndevelopment, parturition and post-natal development. \n \nDengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine, therefore Dengvaxia is contraindicated during pregnancy (see \nsection 4.3).  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during at least one month after \neach dose. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to lactation. \nThere is very limited experience on dengue virus excretion via breast milk. \nAlso, considering that Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine and that there is very limited experience \nfrom post marketing data with Dengvaxia in lactating women, the vaccine is contraindicated during \nlactation (see section 4.3). \n\n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies have been performed on fertility. \nAnimal studies did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nDengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na.  Summary of the safety profile \n \nIn subjects 9 to 45 years of age, the most frequently reported reactions whatever the dengue serostatus \nprior to vaccination, were headache (54%), injection site pain (49%), malaise (44%), myalgia (43%), \nasthenia (34%), and fever (16%). \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nAdverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination except fever which appears within 14 \ndays after the injection. The adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity and of short \nduration (0 to 3 days). \n \nSystemic adverse reactions tended to be less frequent after the second and third injections of \nDengvaxia as compared to the first injection. \n \nAllergic including anaphylactic reactions have been reported very rarely. \n \nOverall, the same adverse reactions but at lower frequencies were observed in dengue seropositive \nsubjects. \nb.  Tabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories:  \nVery common: \u2265 1/10 \nCommon: \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon: \u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100 \nRare: \u2265 1/10 000 to < 1/1000 \nVery rare: (<1/10 000) \n \nAdverse reactions collected within 28 days after any injection during clinical studies from 9 to 45 \nyears of age, on a reactogenicity subset of 1306 adults and 3067 children, and adverse reactions \nobserved during commercial use are presented in Table 1 for children 9 to 17 years old and in Table 2 \nfor adults 18 to 45 years old.  \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions from Clinical Studies and reported during commercial use in \nchildren (9 to 17 years old) \n \n\nSystem Organ Class  Frequency  Adverse Events  \nInfections and infestations  Rare Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nImmune system disorders Very rare Allergic including anaphylactic reactions* \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Headache \nRare  Dizziness \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nRare  Oropharyngeal pain \nCough \nRhinorrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Rare  Nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Urticaria \nRare  Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nRare  Neck pain \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Injection site pain \nMalaise \nAsthenia \nFever \n\nCommon Injection site reactions (erythema, swelling) \nUncommon Injection site reactions (hematoma, pruritus) \n\nInjection site induration \n* Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions from Clinical Studies and reported during commercial use in adults \n(18 to 45 years old) \n \n\nSystem Organ Class  Frequency  Adverse Events  \nInfections and infestations  Uncommon Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nNasopharyngitis \nBlood and lymphatic tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Lymphadenopathy \n\nImmune system disorders Very rare Allergic including anaphylactic reactions* \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Headache \nUncommon Dizziness \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Oropharyngeal pain \nCough \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea \nDry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Rash \nRash generalised \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nUncommon Neck pain \n\nArthralgia \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Injection site pain \nMalaise \nAsthenia \n\nCommon Fever \nInjection site reactions (erythema, hematoma, \nswelling, pruritus) \n\nUncommon Injection site induration \nInjection site warmth \nChills \nFatigue \n\n* Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. \n \nc.  Hospitalised and/or clinically severe dengue fever in long-term safety follow-up data \n \nIn an exploratory analysis of the long-term follow up from the first injection in three efficacy studies, \nan increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue including clinically severe dengue (predominantly \nDengue Haemorrhagic Fever grade 1 or 2 [WHO 1997]) has been observed in vaccinees with no \nprevious dengue infection. Over a period of 6 years, in subjects with no previous dengue infection, the \nrisk of severe dengue is increased by 2.41 fold (95% CI: 0.50; 11.75) in subjects 9 to 16 years of age \nvaccinated with Dengvaxia as compared to non-vaccinated subjects in the same age group. In subjects \n9 years of age or older, it was estimated that during a 6 year follow-up about 5 additional hospitalized \ndengue cases or 3 additional severe dengue cases per 1000 vaccinees with no previous dengue \ninfection could occur following vaccination. Estimates from the long-term analysis suggest the onset \nof increased risk was mainly during the 3rd year following the first injection.  \nThis increased risk was not observed in individuals who have been previously infected by dengue \nvirus, where it was estimated that 16 hospitalized dengue cases or 4 severe dengue cases could be \nprevented per 1000 vaccinees with previous dengue infection during 6 years of follow up from the first \ninjection. \n  \nThe estimations described above for a 6 year period are derived from data obtained in the pivotal \nclinical trials in countries with a particular dengue seroprevalence and epidemiological context. These \nfigures may not be extrapolated to other regions with different seroprevalence and epidemiological \nsituations. \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n \nd.  Paediatric population \n \nPaediatric data in subjects 9 to 17 years of age \n \nIn paediatric population, fever has been observed with a higher frequency (very common) than in \nadults (common). \n \nUrticaria (uncommon) was only reported in subjects 9 to 17 years of age (none in adults). \n \nPaediatric data in subjects below 9 years of age, i.e., outside the age indication \n \nThe reactogenicity subset in subjects below 9 years of age includes 2960 subjects as follows: 1287 \nsubjects below 2 years of age, 905 subjects between 2 and 5 years of age and 768 subjects between 6 \nand 8 years of age. \n \nIn subjects 2 to 8 years of age, as compared to subjects above 9 years of age, injection site erythema \nand swelling were more frequently reported (frequency: very common), and additional adverse events \nwere reported (frequency: uncommon): injection site haemorrhage, decreased appetite and vomiting. \n \nIn subjects 2 to 8 years of age, with no previous dengue infection, long-term safety follow-up data \nshowed an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalisation including clinically severe \ndengue in vaccinated subjects as compared to non-vaccinated subjects. \n \nIn subjects below 2 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions following any \ninjection of Dengvaxia were fever, irritability, appetite lost, abnormal crying and injection site \ntenderness. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX/ Not Yet assigned \n \n1. Mechanism of action \n \nDengvaxia contains live attenuated viruses. Following administration, the viruses replicate locally and \nelicit neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses against the four dengue virus \nserotypes (see detailed data below, subsection 3). \n \n2. Clinical efficacy \n \nThe clinical efficacy of Dengvaxia was assessed in 3 studies: one supportive Phase IIb efficacy study \n(CYD23) in Thailand, and 2 pivotal large-scale Phase III efficacy studies, CYD14 in Asia (Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and CYD15 in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, \nHonduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 25 \n\n \nThe Control Group in dengue studies was defined as subjects who received at least one injection of \nplacebo or comparator vaccine. \n \nIn the Phase IIb study, a total of 4002 subjects aged 4 to 11 years were randomised to receive \nDengvaxia or a control, regardless of previous dengue infection. Efficacy in subjects 9 to 11 years of \nage was assessed in 1554 subjects (1032 in vaccine group and 522 in Control Group). \n \nIn the two pivotal Phase III studies (CYD14 and CYD15), a total of approximately 31000 subjects \naged 2 to 16 years were randomised to receive either Dengvaxia or placebo, regardless of previous \ndengue infection. Efficacy in subjects 9 years of age and older was assessed in 17 230 subjects who \nreceived Dengvaxia (3316 subjects in CYD14 and 13914 in CYD15) and 8596 subjects who received \nplacebo (1656 in CYD14 and 6940 in CYD15). \n \nAt the start of the CYD14 and CYD15 trials, dengue seroprevalence for the overall population at the \ntrial sites ranged from 52.8%-81.1% in CYD14 (Asia-Pacific) and 55.7%-92.7% in CYD15 (Latin \nAmerica). \n \nThe efficacy was assessed during an Active Phase of 25 months, in which surveillance was designed \nto maximize the detection of all symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases regardless \nof the severity. The active detection of symptomatic dengue cases started on the day of the first \ninjection and lasted until each subject had been followed for at least 13 months after the third \ninjection. This phase includes therefore the primary endpoint observation period from 28 days after the \nthird injection up to the end of the Active Phase. \n \nFor the primary endpoint, the incidence of symptomatic VCD cases occurring during the 12-month \nperiod from 28 days after the third injection was compared to the Control Group. \n \nExploratory vaccine efficacy analyses according to dengue serostatus measured by plaque reduction \nneutralization test (PRNT50) at baseline (before the first injection) were performed in the \nimmunogenicity subset of 2000 subjects each in CYD14 and CYD15 and 300 subjects in CYD23. Of \nthe 2930 subjects 9 to 16 years old in this subset (approximately 80%) who were dengue seropositive \nat baseline, 1974 subjects received the vaccine (901 subjects in CYD14 and 1073 in CYD15) and 956 \nsubjects received placebo (444 in CYD14 and 512 in CYD15) (see also subsection 3). \n \n2.1 Clinical efficacy data for subjects 9 to 16 years of age in endemic areas, any serostatus at \nbaseline \n \nThe Vaccine Efficacy (VE) results according to the primary endpoint (symptomatic VCD cases \noccurring during the 12-month period starting from 28 days after the third injection) in subjects 9 to 16 \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nyears of age (any serostatus at baseline) are shown in Table 3 for studies CYD14, CYD15 and \nCYD23. \n \nTable 3: VE against symptomatic VCD cases over the 12-month period starting from 28 days \nafter the third injection due to any of the 4 serotypes in subjects 9 to 16 years (any serostatus at \nbaseline). \n \n \n\nCYD14 CYD15 CYD23 Pooled CYD14+CYD15 \n\nPooled* \nCYD14+CYD15+ \n\nCYD23 \n\n Vaccine group \nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nControl \ngroup \n\nCases / \nperson-\nyears \n\n34 / \n3199 \n\n55 / \n1585 \n\n185 / \n12458 \n\n236 / \n6157 \n\n6 / \n1033 \n\n10 / \n514 \n\n219 / \n15657 \n\n291 / \n7742 \n\n225 / \n16690 \n\n301 / \n8256 \n\nVE % \n(95%CI) \n\n69.4  \n(52.2; 80.6) \n\n61.3  \n(52.8; 68.2) \n\n70.1 \n(9.3; 91.1) \n\n62.8  \n(55.7; 68.8) \n\n63.0 \n(56.1; 68.9) \n\nN: number of subjects per study \nCases: number of subjects with at least one symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue episode in the considered period. \nPerson-years: sum of time-at-risk (in years) for the subjects during the study period. \nCI: confidence interval. \n*Pooled results of CYD14, 15 and 23 need to be interpreted cautiously because of differences in the Dengue confirmatory \ntest and acute febrile illness definition between CYD14/15 and CYD23. \n \nIn subjects 9 to 16 years of age, the efficacy of Dengvaxia against symptomatic virologically-\nconfirmed dengue (VCD) cases due to any of the 4 serotypes was demonstrated in all three studies, \nCYD14, CYD15 and CYD23 (see Table 3). \n \nThe Vaccine Efficacy (VE) against symptomatic VCD, severe and hospitalised VCD during the 25-\nmonth period after the first injection, which were secondary objectives, in subjects 9 to 16 years of age \nare shown in Table 4 for any serostatus at baseline for studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23.

Four hospitalized VCD cases in CYD14 and two hospitalized VCD cases in \nCYD15 were reported in the control group versus none in the vaccine group. These data are \ninconclusive due to the low number of cases in the immunogenicity subset. However, the extrapolated \nvaccine efficacy (1- Hazard Ratio), obtained from an exploratory analysis (pooled CYD14 + CYD15 + \nCYD23) over 25-month period after the first injection, is estimated at 89.2% (95% CI: 78.5; 94.6) for \nhospitalized VCD and 95.3% (95% CI: 68.9; 99.3) for severe VCD. \n \n2.3 Clinical efficacy data for subjects 17 to 45 years of age in endemic areas \n \nNo clinical efficacy study has been done in subjects from 17 to 45 years from endemic areas. The \nclinical efficacy of the vaccine is based on bridging of immunogenicity data (see below section 3.2). \n \n2.4 Other paediatric data from efficacy studies in subjects 2 through 8 years of age, i.e., outside the \nage indication \n \nEfficacy in subjects 2 to 8 years of age was assessed in 2443 subjects (1634 in vaccine group and 809 \nin control group) in phase IIb study and in 5300 subjects (3532 subjects in vaccine group and 1768 in \ncontrol group) in the pivotal Phase III study (CYD14). Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic VCD \ncases over the 12-month  period starting from 28 days after the third injection due to any of the 4 \nserotypes was 40.5% (95% CI: 22.7; 54.2) (pooled CYD14+CYD23). Vaccine Efficacy against \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nsymptomatic, severe and hospitalized VCD during the 25-month period after the first injection due to \nany serotype (pooled CYD14+CYD23), was respectively 42.2% (95% CI: 30.6; 51.8), 45.1% (95% \nCI: 29.3; 76.7),  47.6% (95% CI: 23.7; 64.0).  \n \n2.5 Long-term protection \n \nDuring a period of 6 years after the first injection, in subjects 9 years of age and above with previous \ndengue infection, the extrapolated vaccine efficacy (1-Hazard Ratio)*100 (obtained from an \nexploratory analysis) is estimated at 80 (95% CI: 69; 87) for hospitalized VCD and 84 (95% CI: 61; \n94) for severe VCD. \n \n3. Immunogenicity \n \nDuring clinical development, immunogenicity data were collected in a total of approximately \n5700 subjects 9 months to 60 years of age that received at least one injection of the vaccine. \n \nAmong these 5700 subjects, a total of 3104 subjects 9 to 45 years of age from endemic areas received \nat least one injection of Dengvaxia. Most of the subjects were 9 to 17 years of age (n= 2810). \n \nDuring clinical development, neutralizing antibody titres for each serotype were measured with the \nplaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and presented as geometric mean titres (GMTs). \nAn association between levels of post-injection 3 geometric mean titres (GMTs) and the probability of \nthe disease has been demonstrated in efficacy studies. .  \nHigher titres post-injection 3 are associated with a lower risk of dengue disease and higher vaccine \nefficacy, although an immunological correlate of protection has not been established. \n \nIn the following Tables the dengue serostatus at baseline (before the first injection), was defined as:  \n\u2022 Dengue seropositivity if the PRNT50 titre \u2265 10 [1/dil] (the lower limit of quantification, \n\nLLOQ), against at least one serotype. \n\u2022 Dengue seronegativity if the PRNT50 titre < the lower limit of quantification against any of the \n\n4 serotypes. \n \n3.1 Immunogenicity data for subjects 9 to 17 years of age in endemic areas \n \nThe post dose 3 GMTs in subjects 9 to 16 years of age in CYD14 and CYD15 are shown in the Table \n6. \n\nTable 6: Immunogenicity for dengue seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years of age in CYD14 and \nCYD15 from endemic areas  \n \n\n  Serotype 1 Serotype 2 Serotype 3 Serotype 4 \n\nStudy N \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost-\ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nCYD14 485 \n167 \n\n(138; 202) \n\n437 \n\n(373; 511) \n\n319 \n\n(274; 373) \n\n793 \n\n(704; 892) \n\n160 \n\n(135; 190) \n\n443 \n\n(387; 507) \n\n83.8 \n\n(72.0; 97.6) \n\n272 \n\n(245; 302) \n\nCYD15 1048 \n278 \n\n(247; 313) \n\n703 \n\n(634; 781) \n\n306 \n\n(277; 338) \n\n860 \n\n(796; 930) \n\n261 \n\n(235; 289) \n\n762 \n\n(699; 830) \n\n73.3 \n\n(66.6; 80.7) \n\n306 \n\n(286; 328) \nN: number of subjects with available antibody titre for the relevant endpoint \nDengue seropositive subjects are subjects with titres above or equal to LLOQ against at least one dengue serotype at baseline \nCI: Confidence Interval \nCYD14: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam. \nCYD15: Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico. \n \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n \n3.2 Immunogenicity data for subjects 18 to 45 years of age in endemic areas \n \nThe immunogenicity of the final formulation of the CYD dengue vaccine in adults aged 18 to 45 years \nin endemic areas was assessed in 3 studies conducted all in Asia-Pacific (CYD22 in Vietnam, CYD28 \nin Singapore and CYD47 in India). \nThe GMTs post-dose 3 in subjects 18 to 45 years of age are shown in the Table 7 \n \nTable 7: Immunogenicity for dengue seropositive subjects 18 to 45 years of age from endemic \nareas  \n \n\n  Serotype 1 Serotype 2 Serotype 3 Serotype 4 \n\nStudy N \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT  \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost- \ninjection 3 \n\nGMT  \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost-\ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPre- \ninjection 1 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nPost-\ninjection 3 \n\nGMT \n(95%CI) \n\nCYD22 19 \n408 \n\n(205; 810) \n\n785 \n\n(379; 1626) \n\n437 \n\n(240; 797) \n\n937 \n\n(586; 1499) \n\n192 \n\n(117; 313) \n\n482 \n\n(357; 651) \n\n86.5 \n\n(41.2; 182) \n\n387 \n\n(253; 591) \n\nCYD28 66 \n59.8 \n\n(36.8;97.4) \n\n235 \n\n(135; 409) \n\n67.1 \n\n(40.9; 110) \n\n236 \n\n(144; 387) \n\n48.4 \n\n(32.9;71.0) \n\n239 \n\n(166; 342) \n\n22.1 \n\n(14.7;33.4) \n\n211 \n\n(155; 287) \n\nCYD47 109 \n324 \n\n(236; 445) \n\n688 \n\n(524; 901) \n\n363 \n\n(269; 490) \n\n644 \n\n(509; 814) \n\n394 \n\n(299; 519) \n\n961 \n\n(763;1211) \n\n80.7 \n\n(613; 106) \n\n413 \n\n(331; 516) \nN: number of subjects with available antibody titre for the relevant endpoint \nDengue seropositive subjects are subjects with titres above or equal to LLOQ against at least one dengue serotype at baseline \nCI: Confidence Interval \nCYD28: Low endemic country \nCYD22: Vietnam; CYD28: Singapore; CYD47: India; \n \nThe bridging of efficacy is based on above available data and overall results. Immunogenicity data \navailable from studies in adults aged 18 to 45 years in endemic regions show that post-injection 3 \nGMTs against each serotype are generally higher in adults than in children and adolescents in CYD14 \nand CYD15. Therefore, protection is expected in adults in endemics areas although the actual \nmagnitude of efficacy relative to that observed in children and adolescents is unknown. \n \n3.3 Long-term persistence of antibodies \n \nA decrease in the GMTs against all 4 serotypes was observed one year after the third injection. Then, \nGMTs stabilize over the next 2 to 4 years and remain superior to pre-vaccination GMTs. The GMTs \nlevels depend on age and dengue serostatus at baseline. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been performed on Dengvaxia. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical safety data revealed no special risks for humans based on a repeated-dose toxicity \nincluding assessment of local tolerance, and a developmental and reproductive toxicology program. \nThere was no shedding of Dengvaxia RNA in a distribution and shedding study, hence no risk of \ndissemination to the environment or transmission from vaccinees. A neurovirulence study shows that \nCYD dengue vaccine is not neurotoxic. \n \n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET  \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the User  \n \n\nDengvaxia, powder and solvent for suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \ndengue tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated) \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child is vaccinated because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u2022 This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others. \n\u2022 If you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes \n\nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Dengvaxia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child use Dengvaxia \n3. How to use Dengvaxia \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Dengvaxia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Dengvaxia is and what it is used for  \n \nDengvaxia is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against \"dengue disease\" caused by \ndengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. It contains versions of these 4 varieties of the virus that have \nbeen weakened so that they cannot cause the disease. \n \nDengvaxia is given to adults, young people and children (from 9 to 45 years of age) with prior dengue \nvirus infection and who live in endemic areas (also see sections 2 and 3).  \nEndemic areas are areas where the disease has been continuously present among the people who live \nthere and where outbreaks or epidemics have occurred.  \n \nDengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. \n \nHow the vaccine works \nDengvaxia stimulates the body\u2019s natural defences (immune system), to produces antibodies that will \nhelp protect against the viruses that cause dengue disease if the body is exposed to them in the future. \n \nWhat is dengue and dengue disease? \nDengue is a viral infection which spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. The virus \nfrom an infected person can spread to other people through mosquito bites for about 4 to 5 days \n(maximum 12 days) after the first symptoms appear. Dengue is not transmitted directly from person-\nto-person. \n \nDengue disease results in symptoms including fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint \npain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Symptoms usually last \nfor 2 to 7 days. You can also have dengue but show no symptoms (called \"asymptomatic\"). \n \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nOccasionally dengue can be severe enough for you to have to go to hospital and in rare cases it can \ncause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal \n(belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in the stomach, \nbleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child use Dengvaxia  \n \nTo make sure that Dengvaxia is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything you do \nnot understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. \n \nDo not use Dengvaxia if you or your child \n\u2022 Know you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Dengvaxia \n\n(listed in section 6). \n\u2022 had an allergic reaction after using Dengvaxia before. Signs of an allergic reaction may include \n\nan itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. \n\u2022 have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). This may be due to a genetic defect \n\nor HIV infection. \n\u2022 are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or \n\nchemotherapy). Your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks after you stop treatment. \n\u2022 are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nIf you or your child have never been infected by dengue virus before vaccination, you may have an \nincreased risk of a more serious dengue illness that may lead to hospitalisation if you are later bitten \nby a dengue-infected mosquito.  \nBefore the administration of Dengvaxia, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will check if you or your \nchild have ever been infected by dengue virus, and will tell you if a serotesting has to be performed. \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dengvaxia if you or your child have: \n\u2022 a mild to high fever or acute disease. You will not get Dengvaxia until you or your child have \n\nrecovered. \n\u2022 ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. Your doctor will carefully consider the \n\nrisks and benefits of vaccination. \n\u2022 ever fainted from an injection. Fainting, and sometime falling, can occur (mostly in young \n\npeople) following, or even before, any injection with a needle.  \n\u2022 had any allergic reaction to latex. The tip cap of the pre-filled syringe contains a natural rubber \n\nlatex which may cause an allergic reaction. \n \nTravellers \nVaccination is not recommended if you live in area where dengue infections do not regularly occur \nand if you plan to travel to an area where dengue infections regularly occur. \n \nOutbreaks \nDengvaxia should not be used in the context of dengue outbreak (sudden occurrence of disease) in \nnon-endemic regions. \n \nImportant information about the protection provided \nAs with any vaccines, Dengvaxia may not protect everybody who has been vaccinated. You must \ncontinue to protect yourself against mosquito bites even after vaccination.  \n \nAfter vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue \ninfection, and develop any of the following symptoms: high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent \nvomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, tiredness, restlessness and blood in vomit. \n \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nAdditional protection precautions \nYou should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites. This includes using insect repellents, wearing \nprotective clothing, and using mosquito nets. \n \nYounger children \nChildren less than 9 years of age must not receive the vaccine. \n \nOther medicines and Dengvaxia \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any \nother vaccines or medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\u2022 medicines that affect your body\u2019s natural defences (immune system) such as high-dose \n\ncorticosteroids or chemotherapy. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks \nafter you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well. \n\n\u2022 medicines called \u201cimmunoglobulins\u201d or blood products containing immuno globulins, such as \nblood or plasma. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 6 weeks, and preferably \nnot for 3 months after you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Dengvaxia if you or your daughter are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you or your daughter:  \n\u2022 are of child-bearing age, you must use an effective method of contraception to avoid pregnancy \n\nfor at least one month after each Dengvaxia dose. \n\u2022 think you or your daughter may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse for advice before using Dengvaxia. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDengvaxia contains phenylalanine, sodium and sorbitol \nDengvaxia contains 41 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be \nharmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up \nbecause the body cannot remove it properly. \n \nDengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \nDengvaxia contains 9.38 milligrams of sorbitol in each 0.5 ml dose. \n \n3. How to use Dengvaxia  \n \nDengvaxia is given by your doctor or nurse as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in \nthe upper arm. It must not be injected into a blood vessel. \n \nYou or your child will receive 3 injections of 0.5 mL \u2013 one every 6 months. \n\u2022 The first injection will be given at the chosen or scheduled date. \n\u2022 The second injection, 6 months after the first injection. \n\u2022 The third injection, 6 months after the second injection. \n \nDengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. \nPrevious dengue infection has to be assessed by laboratory confirmed history of dengue or through \nserotesting according to official recommendations. \n \nInstructions for preparing the vaccine intended for medical and healthcare professionals are \nincluded at the end of the leaflet. \n \nIf you or your child miss an injection of Dengvaxia \n\n\n\n 53 \n\n\u2022 If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed \ninjection. It is important that you or your child follow the instructions of your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse regarding follow-up injection.  \n\n\u2022 If you forget or are not able to go back at the schedule time, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse for advice. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, Dengvaxia can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious allergic (anaphylactic) reactions \nIf any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where you or your child received an injection, \ncontact a doctor immediately: \n\u2022 difficulty breathing \n\u2022 blueness of the tongue or lips \n\u2022 a rash \n\u2022 swelling of the face or throat  \n\u2022 low blood pressure causing dizziness or fainting \n\u2022 sudden and serious feeling of illness or unease with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness \n\nand loss of consciousness, rapid heartbeat linked with breathing difficulty. \n \nThese signs or symptoms (anaphylactic reactions) usually develop soon after the injection is given and \nwhile you or your child are still in the clinic or doctor\u2019s surgery. They can also happen very rarely \nafter receiving any vaccine (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). \n \nOther serious reactions  \nFor some people who have not been infected by dengue before vaccination, there may be an increased \nrisk of getting a more serious dengue illness requiring hospitalisation if they become bitten by a \ndengue-infected mosquito later. This increased risk may mainly begin during the third year following \nthe first injection. \n \nOther side effects \nThe following side effects occurred during studies in children, young people and adults. Most of the \nside effects occurred within 3 days of having the injection of Dengvaxia. \n \nVery common: (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \n\u2022 generally feeling unwell (malaise)  \n\u2022 weakness (asthenia) \n\u2022 injection site pain \n\u2022 fever. \n \nCommon: (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 injection site reactions: redness (erythema), bruising (haematoma), swelling, and itching \n\n(pruritus). \n \nUncommon: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 infections of the nose or throat (upper respiratory tract) \n\u2022 feeling dizzy \n\u2022 sore throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 rash (skin eruption) \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 hardening of skin at the injection site (injection site induration). \n \nVery rare: (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people) \n\u2022 allergic reactions. \n \nAdditional side effects in adults:  \nUncommon: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis) \n\u2022 swollen glands (lymphadenopathy) \n\u2022 dry mouth \n\u2022 skin eruption over the whole body (rash generalized) \n\u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \n\u2022 injection site warmth \n\u2022 chills \n\u2022 fatigue. \n \nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents (from 9 to and including 17 years of age): \nUncommon: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 itchy rash (urticaria). \n\n \nRare: (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) \n\u2022 runny nose (rhinorrhea). \n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

The same information is also available on the following URL: \nhttp://qr.sanofi.com/dengvaxia \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\u2022 As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be \n\nreadily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of \nDengvaxia. \n\n\u2022 Dengvaxia must not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same syringe. \n\u2022 Dengvaxia must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances. \n\u2022 Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous (SC) injection preferably in the upper arm \n\nin the region of the deltoid. \n\u2022 Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic \n\nresponse to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling \nand to manage syncopal reactions. \n\n \nReconstitution and handling of single-dose presentation  \n \nDengvaxia must be reconstituted prior to administration. \n \nDengvaxia is reconstituted by transferring all of the solvent (0.4% sodium chloride solution) provided \nin the blue-labeled pre-filled syringe into the vial of freeze-dried powder with a yellowish green \nflip-off cap.  \n\n1. Attach a sterile needle to the pre-filled syringe for the transfer of the solvent. \n2. Transfer the entire content of the pre-filled syringe into the vial containing the powder. \n3. Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved. \n\n \nThe suspension should be visually inspected prior to administration. After reconstitution, Dengvaxia is \na clear, colourless liquid with the possible presence of white to translucent particles (of endogenous \nnature). \n \nAfter complete dissolution, a 0.5 mL dose of the reconstituted suspension is withdrawn into the same \nsyringe. For injection, the syringe should be fitted with a new sterile needle. \n \nContact with disinfectants is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine viruses. \n \nAfter reconstitution with the solvent provided, Dengvaxia must be used immediately. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.  \n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://qr.sanofi.com/dengvaxia\n\n\n 58 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the User  \n \n\nDengvaxia, powder and solvent for suspension for injection in multidose containers \ndengue tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated) \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Dengvaxia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Dengvaxia is and what it is used for  \n \nDengvaxia is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against \"dengue disease\" caused by \ndengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. It contains versions of these 4 varieties of the virus that have \nbeen weakened so that they cannot cause the disease. \n \nDengvaxia is given to adults, young people and children (from 9 to 45 years of age) with prior dengue \nvirus infection and who live in endemic areas (also see sections 2 and 3).  \nEndemic areas are areas where the disease has been continuously present among the people who live \nthere and where outbreaks or epidemics have occurred.  \n \nDengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. \n \nHow the vaccine works \nDengvaxia stimulates the body\u2019s natural defences (immune system), to produces antibodies that will \nhelp protect against the viruses that cause dengue disease if the body is exposed to them in the future. \n \nWhat is dengue and dengue disease? \nDengue is a viral infection which spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. The virus \nfrom an infected person can spread to other people through mosquito bites for about 4 to 5 days \n(maximum 12 days) after the first symptoms appear. Dengue is not transmitted directly from person-\nto-person. \n \nDengue disease results in symptoms including fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint \npain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Symptoms usually last \nfor 2 to 7 days. You can also have dengue but show no symptoms (called \"asymptomatic\"). \n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nOccasionally dengue can be severe enough for you to have to go to hospital and in rare cases it can \ncause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal \n(belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in the stomach, \nbleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child use Dengvaxia  \n \nTo make sure that Dengvaxia is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything you do \nnot understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. \n \nDo not use Dengvaxia if you or your child \n\u2022 Know you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Dengvaxia \n\n(listed in section 6). \n\u2022 had an allergic reaction after using Dengvaxia before. Signs of an allergic reaction may include \n\nan itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. \n\u2022 have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). This may be due to a genetic defect \n\nor HIV infection. \n\u2022 are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or \n\nchemotherapy). Your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks after you stop treatment. \n\u2022 are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nIf you or your child have never been infected by dengue virus before vaccination, you may have an \nincreased risk of a more serious dengue illness that may lead to hospitalisation if you are later bitten \nby a dengue-infected mosquito.  \nBefore the administration of Dengvaxia, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will check if you or your \nchild have ever been infected by dengue virus, and will tell you if a serotesting has to be performed. \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dengvaxia if you or your child have: \n\u2022 a mild to high fever or acute disease. You will not get Dengvaxia until you or your child have \n\nrecovered. \n\u2022 ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. Your doctor will carefully consider the \n\nrisks and benefits of vaccination. \n\u2022 ever fainted from an injection. Fainting, and sometime falling, can occur (mostly in young \n\npeople) following, or even before, any injection with a needle. \n \nTravellers \nVaccination is not recommended if you live in area where dengue infections do not regularly occur \nand if you plan to travel to an area where dengue infections regularly occur. \n \nOutbreaks \nDengvaxia should not be used in the context of dengue outbreak (sudden occurrence of disease) in \nnon-endemic regions. \n \nImportant information about the protection provided \nAs with any vaccines, Dengvaxia may not protect everybody who has been vaccinated. You must \ncontinue to protect yourself against mosquito bites even after vaccination.  \n \nAfter vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue \ninfection, and develop any of the following symptoms: high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent \nvomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, tiredness, restlessness and blood in vomit. \n \n\n\n\n 60 \n\nAdditional protection precautions \nYou should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites. This includes using insect repellents, wearing \nprotective clothing, and using mosquito nets. \n \nYounger children \nChildren less than 9 years of age must not receive the vaccine. \n \nOther medicines and Dengvaxia \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any \nother vaccines or medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\u2022 medicines that affect your body\u2019s natural defences (immune system) such as high-dose \n\ncorticosteroids or chemotherapy. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks \nafter you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well. \n\n\u2022 medicines called \u201cimmunoglobulins\u201d or blood products containing immuno globulins, such as \nblood or plasma. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 6 weeks, and preferably \nnot for 3 months after you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Dengvaxia if you or your daughter are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you or your daughter:  \n\u2022 are of child-bearing age, you must use an effective method of contraception to avoid pregnancy \n\nfor at least one month after each Dengvaxia dose. \n\u2022 think you or your daughter may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse for advice before using Dengvaxia. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDengvaxia contains phenylalanine, sodium and sorbitol \nDengvaxia contains 8 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be \nharmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up \nbecause the body cannot remove it properly. \n \nDengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \nDengvaxia contains 1.76 milligrams of sorbitol in each 0.5 ml dose. \n \n3. How to use Dengvaxia  \n \nDengvaxia is given by your doctor or nurse as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in \nthe upper arm. It must not be injected into a blood vessel. \n \nYou or your child will receive 3 injections of 0.5 mL \u2013 one every 6 months. \n\u2022 The first injection will be given at the chosen or scheduled date. \n\u2022 The second injection, 6 months after the first injection. \n\u2022 The third injection, 6 months after the second injection. \n \nDengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. \nPrevious dengue infection has to be assessed by laboratory confirmed history of dengue or through \nserotesting according to official recommendations. \n \nInstructions for preparing the vaccine intended for medical and healthcare professionals are \nincluded at the end of the leaflet. \n \nIf you or your child miss an injection of Dengvaxia \n\n\n\n 61 \n\n \n\u2022 If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed \n\ninjection. It is important that you or your child follow the instructions of your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse regarding follow-up injection.  \n\n\u2022 If you forget or are not able to go back at the schedule time, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse for advice. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, Dengvaxia can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious allergic (anaphylactic) reactions \nIf any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where you or your child received an injection, \ncontact a doctor immediately: \n\u2022 difficulty breathing \n\u2022 blueness of the tongue or lips \n\u2022 a rash \n\u2022 swelling of the face or throat  \n\u2022 low blood pressure causing dizziness or fainting \n\u2022 sudden and serious feeling of illness or unease with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness \n\nand loss of consciousness, rapid heartbeat linked with breathing difficulty. \n \nThese signs or symptoms (anaphylactic reactions) usually develop soon after the injection is given and \nwhile you or your child are still in the clinic or doctor\u2019s surgery. They can also happen very rarely \nafter receiving any vaccine (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). \n \nOther serious reactions  \nFor some people who have not been infected by dengue before vaccination, there may be an increased \nrisk of getting a more serious dengue illness requiring hospitalisation if they become bitten by a \ndengue-infected mosquito later. This increased risk may mainly begin during the third year following \nthe first injection. \n \nOther side effects \nThe following side effects occurred during studies in children, young people and adults. Most of the \nside effects occurred within 3 days of having the injection of Dengvaxia. \n \nVery common: (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \n\u2022 generally feeling unwell (malaise)  \n\u2022 weakness (asthenia) \n\u2022 injection site pain \n\u2022 fever. \n \nCommon: (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 injection site reactions: redness (erythema), bruising (haematoma), swelling, and itching \n\n(pruritus). \n \nUncommon: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 infections of the nose or throat (upper respiratory tract) \n\u2022 feeling dizzy \n\u2022 sore throat (oropharyngeal pain) \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\n\n\n 62 \n\n\u2022 rash (skin eruption) \n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 hardening of skin at the injection site (injection site induration). \n \nVery rare: (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people) \n\u2022 allergic reactions. \n \nAdditional side effects in adults:  \nUncommon: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis) \n\u2022 swollen glands (lymphadenopathy) \n\u2022 dry mouth \n\u2022 skin eruption over the whole body (rash generalized) \n\u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \n\u2022 injection site warmth \n\u2022 chills \n\u2022 fatigue. \n \nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents (from 9 to and including 17 years of age): \nUncommon: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 itchy rash (urticaria). \n\n \nRare: (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) \n\u2022 runny nose (rhinorrhea). \n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

The same information is also available on the following URL: \nhttp://qr.sanofi.com/dengvaxia \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\u2022 As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be \n\nreadily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of \nDengvaxia. \n\n\u2022 Dengvaxia must not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same syringe. \n\u2022 Dengvaxia must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances.  \n\u2022 Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous (SC) injection preferably in the upper arm \n\nin the region of the deltoid. \n\u2022 Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic \n\nresponse to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling \nand to manage syncopal reactions. \n\n \nReconstitution and handling of multidose presentation \n \nDengvaxia must be reconstituted prior to administration. \n \nDengvaxia is reconstituted by transferring all of the solvent (0.9% sodium chloride solution) provided \nin the 5-dose vial with a dark gray flip-off cap into the 5-dose vial of freeze-dried powder with a \nmedium brown flip-off cap, using a sterile syringe and needle.  \n\n1. Use a sterile syringe and needle for the transfer of the solvent. \n2. Transfer the entire content of the solvent vial (with a dark gray flip-off cap) into the vial \ncontaining the powder (medium brown flip-off cap). \n3. Swirl gently until the powder is dissolved. \n\n \nThe suspension should be visually inspected prior to administration. After reconstitution, Dengvaxia is \na clear, colourless liquid with the possible presence of white to translucent particles (of endogenous \nnature). \n \nAfter complete dissolution, a 0.5 mL dose of the reconstituted suspension is withdrawn into a sterile \nsyringe. A new sterile syringe and needle should be used for withdrawal of each of the 5 doses. The \nrecommended size of the needle to be used is 23G or 25G. \n \nBefore each injection, the reconstituted suspension should be gently swirled once again. \n \nContact with disinfectants is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine viruses. \n \nAfter reconstitution with the solvent provided, Dengvaxia must be used within 6 hours. \n \nPartially used multidose vials must be kept between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (i.e., in a refrigerator) and protected \nfrom light. \n \nAny remaining vaccine doses should be discarded at the end of the immunization session or within 6 \nhours after reconstitution, whichever comes first. \n \nA partially used multidose vial must be discarded immediately if: \n\u2022 Sterile dose withdrawal has not been fully observed. \n\u2022 A new sterile syringe and needle were not used for reconstitution or withdrawal of each of the \n\nprevious doses. \n\u2022 There is any suspicion that the partially used vial has been contaminated. \n\u2022 There is visible evidence of contamination, such as a change in appearance. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://qr.sanofi.com/dengvaxia\n\n\n 66 \n\n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what dengvaxia is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "dengvaxia is a vaccine. it is used to help protect you or your child against \"dengue disease\" caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. it contains versions of these 4 varieties of the virus that have been weakened so that they cannot cause the disease. dengvaxia is given to adults, young people and children (from 9 to 45 years of age) with prior dengue virus infection and who live in endemic areas (also see sections 2 and 3). endemic areas are areas where the disease has been continuously present among the people who live there and where outbreaks or epidemics have occurred. dengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. how the vaccine works dengvaxia stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system), to produces antibodies that will help protect against the viruses that cause dengue disease if the body is exposed to them in the future. what is dengue and dengue disease? dengue is a viral infection which spreads through the bite of an infected aedes mosquito. the virus from an infected person can spread to other people through mosquito bites for about 4 to 5 days (maximum 12 days) after the first symptoms appear. dengue is not transmitted directly from person- to-person. dengue disease results in symptoms including fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. symptoms usually last for 2 to 7 days. you can also have dengue but show no symptoms (called \"asymptomatic\"). occasionally dengue can be severe enough for you to have to go to hospital and in rare cases it can cause death. severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal (belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in the stomach, bleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "dengvaxia", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "a vaccine", "Type": "TREATMENT",

allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of dengvaxia (listed in section 6). had an allergic reaction after using dengvaxia before. signs of an allergic reaction may include an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). this may be due to a genetic defect or hiv infection. are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or chemotherapy). your doctor will not use dengvaxia until 4 weeks after you stop treatment. are pregnant or breast-feeding. warnings and precautions if you or your child have never been infected by dengue virus before vaccination, you may have an increased risk of a more serious dengue illness that may lead to hospitalisation if you are later bitten by a dengue-infected mosquito. before the administration of dengvaxia, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will check if you or your child have ever been infected by dengue virus, and will tell you if a serotesting has to be performed. tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using dengvaxia if you or your child have: a mild to high fever or acute disease. you will not get dengvaxia until you or your child have recovered. ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. your doctor will carefully consider the risks and benefits of vaccination. ever

the pre-filled syringe contains a natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction. travellers vaccination is not recommended if you live in area where dengue infections do not regularly occur and if you plan to travel to an area where dengue infections regularly occur. outbreaks dengvaxia should not be used in the context of dengue outbreak (sudden occurrence of disease) in non-endemic regions. important information about the protection provided as with any vaccines, dengvaxia may not protect everybody who has been vaccinated. you must continue to protect yourself against mosquito bites even after vaccination. after vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue infection, and develop any of the following symptoms:
