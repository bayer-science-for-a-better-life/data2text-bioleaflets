NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nPANTECTA Control 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 20 mg pantoprazole (as sodium sesquihydrate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nGastro-resistant tablet.  \n\n \n\nYellow, oval biconvex film-coated tablets imprinted with “P20” in brown ink on one side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nPANTECTA Control is indicated for short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn, acid \n\nregurgitation) in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose is 20 mg pantoprazole (one tablet) per day.  \n\n \n\nIt might be necessary to take the tablets for 2-3 consecutive days to achieve improvement of \n\nsymptoms. Once complete relief of symptoms has occurred, treatment should be discontinued. \n\nThe treatment should not exceed 4 weeks without consulting a doctor. \n\n \n\nIf no symptom relief is obtained within 2 weeks of continuous treatment, the patient should be \n\ninstructed to consult a doctor. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients or in those with impaired renal or liver function. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPANTECTA Control is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age \n\ndue to insufficient data on safety and efficacy. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nPANTECTA Control 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, and should be \n\nswallowed whole with liquid before a meal. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\nCo-administration with atazanavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to consult a doctor if: \n\n \n\n They have unintentional weight loss, anaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia, persistent \nvomiting or vomiting with blood, since it may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis of a \n\nsevere condition. In these cases, malignancy should be excluded. \n\n \n\n They have had previous gastric ulcer or gastrointestinal surgery. \n \n\n They are on continuous symptomatic treatment of indigestion or heartburn for 4 or more weeks.  \n \n\n They have jaundice, hepatic impairment, or liver disease. \n \n\n They have any other serious disease affecting general well-being. \n \n\n They are aged over 55 years with new or recently changed symptoms. \n \n\nPatients with long-term recurrent symptoms of indigestion or heartburn should see their doctor at \n\nregular intervals. Especially, patients over 55 years taking any non-prescription indigestion or \n\nheartburn remedy on a daily basis should inform their pharmacist or doctor. \n\n \n\nPatients should not take another proton pump inhibitor or H2 antagonist concomitantly. \n\n \n\nPatients should consult their doctor before taking this medicinal product if they are due to have an \n\nendoscopy or urea breath test. \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised that the tablets are not intended to provide immediate relief. \n\nPatients may start to experience symptomatic relief after approximately one day of treatment with \n\npantoprazole, but it might be necessary to take it for 7 days to achieve complete heartburn control. \n\nPatients should not take pantoprazole as a preventive medicinal product. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria \n\nDecreased gastric acidity, due to any means - including proton pump inhibitors - increases gastric \n\ncounts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with acid-reducing \n\nmedicinal products leads to a slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, \n\nCampylobacter, or Clostridium difficile. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPANTECTA Control may reduce the absorption of active substances whose bioavailability is \n\ndependent on the gastric pH (e.g. ketoconazole). \n\n \n\nIt has been shown that co-administration of atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg with omeprazole \n\n(40 mg once daily) or atazanavir 400 mg with lansoprazole (60 mg single dose) to healthy volunteers \n\nresulted in a substantial reduction in the bioavailability of atazanavir. The absorption of atazanavir is \n\npH-dependent. Therefore, pantoprazole must not be co-administered with atazanavir (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nAlthough no interaction during concomitant administration of phenprocoumon or warfarin has been \n\nobserved in clinical pharmacokinetic studies, a few isolated cases of changes in International \n\nNormalised Ratio (INR) have been reported during concomitant treatment in the post-marketing \n\nperiod. Therefore, in patients treated with coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. phenprocoumon or warfarin), \n\nmonitoring of prothrombin time/INR is recommended after initiation, termination or during irregular \n\nuse of pantoprazole. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nConcomitant use of high dose methotrexate (e.g. 300 mg) and proton-pump inhibitors has been \n\nreported to increase methotrexate levels in some patients. Therefore in settings where high-dose \n\nmethotrexate is used, for example cancer and psoriasis, a temporary withdrawal of pantoprazole may \n\nneed to be considered. \n\n \n\nPantoprazole is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Interaction studies \n\nwith carbamazepine, caffeine, diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glibenclamide, metoprolol, \n\nnaproxen, nifedipine, phenytoin, piroxicam, theophylline and an oral contraceptive containing \n\nlevonorgestrel and ethinyl oestradiol did not reveal clinically significant interactions. However, an \n\ninteraction of pantoprazole with other substances which are metabolised by the same enzyme system \n\ncannot be excluded.  \n\n \n\nThere were no interactions with concomitantly administered antacids. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of pantoprazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity. Preclinical studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or \n\nteratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Pantoprazole should \n\nnot be used during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether pantoprazole is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \n\nexcretion of pantoprazole in breast milk. Pantoprazole should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility following the administration of pantoprazole in animal \n\nstudies (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPANTECTA Control has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However \n\nadverse  reactions such as dizziness and visual disturbances may occur (see section 4.8). If affected, \n\npatients should not drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nApproximately 5% of patients can be expected to experience adverse  reactions . The most commonly \n\nreported adverse reactions are diarrhoea and headache, both occuring in approximately 1% of \n\npatients.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with pantoprazole. \n\n \n\nWithin the following table, adverse reactions are ranked under the MedDRA  frequency classification: \n\n \n\nVery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare  \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\n \n\nDoses up to 240 mg administered intravenously over 2 minutes were well tolerated. \n\nAs pantoprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not readily dialysable. \n\n \n\nIn the case of overdose with clinical signs of intoxication, apart from symptomatic and supportive \n\ntreatment, no specific therapeutic recommendations can be made. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: : Drugs for acid related disorders,Proton pump inhibitors, ATC code: \n\nA02BC02 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nPantoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole which inhibits the secretion of hydrochloric acid in the \n\nstomach by specific blockade of the proton pumps of the parietal cells. \n\n \n\nPantoprazole is converted to its active form, a cyclic sulphenamide, in the acidic environment in the \n\nparietal cells where it inhibits the H+, K+-ATPase enzyme, i. e. the final stage in the production of \n\nhydrochloric acid in the stomach.  \n\nThe inhibition is dose-dependent and affects both basal and stimulated acid secretion. In most \n\npatients, freedom from heartburn and acid reflux symptoms is achieved in 1 week. Pantoprazole \n\nreduces acidity in the stomach and thereby increases gastrin in proportion to the reduction in acidity. \n\nThe increase in gastrin is reversible. Since pantoprazole binds to the enzyme distal to the receptor \n\nlevel, it can inhibit hydrochloric acid secretion independently of stimulation by other substances \n\n(acetylcholine, histamine, gastrin). The effect is the same whether the active substance is given orally \n\nor intravenously. \n\n \n\nThe fasting gastrin values increase under pantoprazole. On short-term use, in most cases they do not \n\nexceed the upper limit of normal. During long-term treatment, gastrin levels double in most cases. An \n\nexcessive increase, however, occurs only in isolated cases. As a result, a mild to moderate increase in \n\nthe number of specific endocrine (ECL) cells in the stomach is observed in a minority of cases during \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nlong-term treatment (simple to adenomatoid hyperplasia). However, according to the studies \n\nconducted so far, the formation of carcinoid precursors (atypical hyperplasia) or gastric carcinoids as \n\nwere found in animal experiments (see section 5.3) have not been observed in humans. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy  \n\nIn a retrospective analysis of 17 studies in 5960 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease \n\n(GORD) who were treated with 20 mg pantoprazole monotherapy, the symptoms associated with acid \n\nreflux e.g. heartburn and acid regurgitation were evaluated according to a standardised methodology. \n\nStudies selected had to have at least one acid reflux symptom recording point at 2 weeks. GORD \n\ndiagnosis in these studies was based on endoscopic assessment, with the exception of one study in \n\nwhich the inclusion of the patients was based on symptomatology alone.  \n\n \n\nIn these studies, the percentage of patients experiencing complete relief from heartburn after 7 days \n\nwas between 54.0% and 80.6% in the pantoprazole group. After 14 and 28 days, complete heartburn \n\nrelief was experienced in 62.9% to 88.6% and 68.1% to 92.3% of the patients, respectively.  \n\n \n\nFor the complete relief from acid regurgitation, similar results were obtained as for heartburn. After \n\n7 days the percentage of patients experiencing complete relief from acid regurgitation was between \n\n61.5% and 84.4%, after 14 days between 67.7% and 90.4%, and after 28 days between 75.2% and \n\n94.5%, respectively. \n\n \n\nPantoprazole was consistently shown to be superior to placebo and H2RA and non-inferior to other \n\nPPIs. Acid-reflux symptom relief rates were largely independent of the initial GORD stage. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics do not vary after single or repeated administration. In the dose range of 10 to \n\n80 mg, the plasma kinetics of pantoprazole are linear after both oral and intravenous administration. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nPantoprazole is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The absolute \n\nbioavailability from the tablet was found to be about 77 %. On average, at about 2.0 h - 2.5 h post \n\nadministration (tmax) of a single 20 mg oral dose, the maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) of about \n\n1-1.5 µg/ml are achieved, and these values remain constant after multiple administration. Concomitant \n\nintake of food had no influence on bioavailability (AUC or Cmax), but increased the variability of the \n\nlag-time (tlag). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nVolume of distribution is about 0.15 l/kg and serum protein binding is about 98%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nPantoprazole is almost exclusively metabolized in the liver. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nClearance is about 0.1 l/h/kg, and terminal half-life (t1/2) about 1 h. There were a few cases of subjects \n\nwith delayed elimination. Due to the specific binding of pantoprazole to the proton pumps within the \n\nparietal cell, the elimination half-life does not correlate with the much longer duration of action \n\n(inhibition of acid secretion). \n\n \n\nRenal elimination represents the major route of excretion (about 80%) for the metabolites of \n\npantoprazole; the rest is excreted with the faeces. The main metabolite in both serum and urine is \n\ndesmethylpantoprazole, which is conjugated with sulphate. The half-life of the main metabolite (about \n\n1.5 h) is not much longer than that of pantoprazole. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nNo dose reduction is recommended when pantoprazole is administered to patients with impaired renal \n\nfunction (including patients on dialysis, which removes only negligible amounts of pantoprazole). As \n\nwith healthy subjects, the half-life of pantoprazole is short. Although the main metabolite has a longer \n\nhalf-life (2-3h), excretion is still rapid and thus accumulation does not occur. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nAfter administration of pantoprazole to patients with liver impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B and \n\nC) the half-life values increased to between 3 and 7 h and the AUC values increased by a factor of \n\n3-6, whereas the Cmax only increased slightly by a factor of 1.3 compared with healthy subjects.  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThe slight increase in AUC and Cmax in elderly volunteers compared with younger subjects was not \n\nclinically relevant. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\n \n\nIn the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats, neuroendocrine neoplasms were found. In addition, \n\nsquamous cell papillomas were found in the forestomach of rats in one study. The mechanism leading \n\nto the formation of gastric carcinoids by substituted benzimidazoles has been carefully investigated \n\nand allows the conclusion that it is a secondary reaction to the massively elevated serum gastrin levels \n\noccurring in the rat during chronic high-dose treatment. \n\n \n\nIn the 2-year rodent studies an increased number of liver tumors was observed in rats (in one rat study \n\nonly) and in female mice and was interpreted as being due to pantoprazole's high metabolic rate in the \n\nliver. \n\nA slight increase of neoplastic changes of the thyroid was observed in the group of rats receiving the \n\nhighest dose (200 mg/kg) in one 2-year study. The occurrence of these neoplasms is associated with \n\nthe pantoprazole-induced changes in the breakdown of thyroxine in the rat liver. As the therapeutic \n\ndose in man is low, no side effects on the thyroid glands are expected. \n\n \n\nIn animal studies (rats) 5 mg/kg was the observed NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) for \n\nembryotoxicity. Investigations revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenic effects.  \n\nPenetration of the placenta was investigated in the rat and was found to increase with advanced \n\ngestation. As a result, concentration of pantoprazole in the foetus is increased shortly before birth. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What PANTECTA Control is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nPANTECTA Control contains the active substance pantoprazole, which blocks the ‘pump’ that \n\nproduces stomach acid. Hence it reduces the amount of acid in your stomach.  \n\n \n\nPANTECTA Control is used for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (for example heartburn, \n\nacid regurgitation) in adults.  \n\nReflux is the backflow of acid from the stomach into the gullet (“foodpipe”), which may become \n\ninflamed and painful. This may cause you symptoms such as a painful burning sensation in the chest \n\nrising up to the throat (heartburn) and a sour taste in the mouth (acid regurgitation). \n\n \n\nYou may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of \n\ntreatment with PANTECTA Control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief. It may \n\nbe necessary to take the tablets for 2-3 consecutive days to relieve the symptoms.  \n\n \n\nYou must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 2 weeks. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take PANTECTA Control \n \n\nDo not take PANTECTA Control:  \n\n- if you are allergic  to pantoprazole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you are taking a medicine containing atazanavir (for the treatment of HIV-infection) See \n\n‘Other medicines and PANTECTA Control’. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking PANTECTA Control  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n- if you have been treated for heartburn or indigestion continuously for 4 or more weeks \n\n- if you are over 55 years old and taking non-prescription indigestion treatment on a daily basis \n\n- if you are over 55 years old with any new or recently changed reflux symptoms \n\n- if you have previously had a gastric ulcer or stomach surgery \n\n- if you have liver problems or jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes) \n\n- if you regularly see your doctor for serious complaints or conditions   \n\n- if you are due to have an endoscopy or a breath test called a C-urea test. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately, before or after taking this medicine, if you notice any of the following \n\nsymptoms, which could be a sign of another, more serious, disease: \n\n- an unintentional loss of weight (not related to a diet or an exercise programme) \n- vomiting, particularly if repeated \n- vomiting blood; this may appear as dark coffee grounds in your vomit \n- you notice blood in your stools; which may be black or tarry in appearance \n- difficulty in swallowing or pain when swallowing \n- you look pale and feel weak (anaemia) \n- chest pain \n- stomach pain \n- severe and/or persistent diarrhoea, because this medicine has been associated with a small \n\nincrease in infectious diarrhoea. \n\nYour doctor may decide that you need some tests.  \n\n \n\nIf you are due to have a blood test, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nYou may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of \n\ntreatment with PANTECTA Control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief. \n\nYou should not take it as a preventive measure. \n\n \n\nIf you have been suffering from repetitive heartburn or indigestion symptoms for some time, \n\nremember to see your doctor regularly. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nPANTECTA Control should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to a \n\nlack of safety information in this younger age group.. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and PANTECTA Control \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines \n\nPANTECTA Control may stop certain other medicines from working properly. Especially medicines \n\ncontaining one of the following active substances:  \n\n- atazanavir (used to treat HIV-infection). You must not use PANTECTA Control if you are taking \natazanavir. See ‘Do not take PANTECTA Control’. \n\n- ketoconazole (used for fungal infections). \n- warfarin and phenprocoumon (used to thin blood and prevent clots). You may need further \n\nblood tests \n\n- methotrexate (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer) – if you are taking \nmethotrexate your doctor may temporarily stop your PANTECTA Control treatment because \n\npantoprazole can increase levels of methotrexate in the blood. \n\n \n\nDo not take PANTECTA Control with other medicines which limit the amount of acid produced in \n\nyour stomach, such as another proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole, lansoprazole or rabeprazole) or an \n\nH2 antagonist (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine). \n\nHowever, you may take PANTECTA Control with antacids (e.g. magaldrate, alginic acid, sodium \n\nbicarbonate, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, or combinations thereof), if needed. \n\n \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nYou should not take this medicine if you are pregnant or while-breastfeeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you experience side effects like dizziness or disturbed vision, you should not drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.
