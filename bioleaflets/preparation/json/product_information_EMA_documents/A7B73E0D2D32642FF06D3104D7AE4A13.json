This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHEPCLUDEX 2 mg powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains bulevirtide acetate equivalent to 2 mg bulevirtide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nThe powder is white to off-white. \nAfter reconstitution, solution with a pH of approximately 9.0 and osmolality of approximately \n300 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHepcludex is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in plasma (or \nserum) HDV-RNA positive adult patients with compensated liver disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated only by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with HDV \ninfection.  \n \nPosology \n \nBulevirtide should be administered at 2 mg once daily (every 24 h ± 4 h) by subcutaneous injection as \nmonotherapy or in co-administration with a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue for treatment of underlying \nHBV infection. \n \nConcerning co-administration with the nucleoside-nucleotide analogues for treatment of HBV infection, \nrefer to section 4.4. \n \nDuration of treatment \nThe optimal treatment duration is unknown. Treatment should be continued as long as associated with \nclinical benefit. \n \nConsideration to discontinue the treatment should be given in case of sustained (6 months) HBsAg \nseroconversion or loss of virological and biochemical response.  \n \nMissed doses \nIf an injection has been omitted and less than 4 hours have elapsed since the scheduled time, the injection \nmust be performed as soon as possible. The time of the next injection will not be calculated from the \ntime of the \"rescue\" injection, but according to the injection schedule previously established. It is, \n\n\n\n3 \n\ntherefore, necessary to return to the usual pattern of administration, at the appointed time, the following \nday. \n \nIf an injection has been missed and more than 4 hours have elapsed since the scheduled time, the missed \ndose should not be administered. \n \nThe next injection will take place according to the usual schedule (injection of the prescribed dose \nwithout doubling), at the appointed time the next day. \n \nIf the injection has been made by mistake more than 4 hours after the scheduled time, the next \nadministration must take place in the usual way (i.e. in accordance with the original schedule). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population  \nNo data is available in patients >65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo studies have been conducted with bulevirtide in patients with renal impairment.  \nRenal function should be carefully monitored. Elevation of bile salts may occur during treatment. Due \nto renal excretion of bile salts, elevation of bile salts may be greater in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte class \nA). The safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not been \nestablished (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in patients younger than 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data is available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor subcutaneous use only. Bulevirtide may be injected into sites such as the upper thigh, or abdomen. \n \nAppropriate training should be given to the patients self-administering the product to minimise the risk \nof the injection site reactions.  \n \nThe “Instructions for the User”, provided in the carton, must be followed carefully by the patient.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHDV and HBV genotype \n \nHDV genotype 1 was predominant in the clinical trials population. It is not known whether HDV or \nHBV genotype affects the clinical efficacy of bulevirtide.   \n \nDecompensated liver disease \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in patients with decompensated cirrhosis has \nnot been established. The use in patients with decompensated liver disease is not recommended. \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) \n \nThe underlying HBV infection should be simultaneously managed according to current treatment \nguidelines. In the clinical study of bulevirtide MYR202, only patients with signs of active hepatitis \ndespite nucleoside/nucleotide analogue treatment were included; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was co-\nadministered with bulevirtide. Close monitoring of HBV-DNA levels is recommended. \n \nHepatitis exacerbations after treatment cessation \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment with bulevirtide can lead to reactivation of the HDV and HBV infection \nand exacerbation of hepatitis. In case of treatment discontinuation, careful monitoring of liver function \nincluding transaminase levels, as well as HBV DNA and HDV RNA viral load should be performed. \n\n \nIncrease of bile salts \n \nAsymptomatic and dose-dependent elevation of serum bile salts has been very commonly observed with \nbulevirtide. This increase is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. It can be expected in the \nmajority of patients taking into account the mechanism of action of bulevirtide which, by inactivating \nthe NTCP (sodium taurocholate co-transporter polypeptide) receptor, blocks the transport of bile acids \nfrom portal blood to hepatocytes. In patients with renal insufficiency, the increase in bile salts may be \nmore pronounced. \n \nThere are no data available on the long-term impact (> 48 weeks) of this bile salt increase induced by \nbulevirtide (see section 4.8). \n \nAdministration site reactions \nBulevirtide is intended for subcutaneous injection which is associated with risks for injection site \nreactions such as swelling, redness, irritation, itchiness, infection, hematoma and local pain. These local \nreactions are more likely to appear if the injection is accidentally misplaced or the solution accidentally \nmisdirected to the soft tissue.  \n \nCo-infection with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus: \n \nNo data are available from HIV or HCV co-infected patients.  \n \nExcipients: \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially \"sodium-free\". \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro, it has been shown, that certain medicinal products can inhibit bulevirtide target sodium-\ntaurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). The co-administration of such medicinal products \n(e.g. sulfasalazin, irbesartan, ezetimibe, ritonavir, and ciclosporin A) is not recommended. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, close clinical monitoring is warranted when NTCP substrates (e.g. estrone-\n3-sulfate, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and thyroid hormones) are co-\nadministered with bulevirtide. When possible, co-administration of these substrates should be avoided. \n \nIn vitro an inhibition of OATP1B1/3 transporters by bulevirtide was observed, albeit only at a \nconcentration ≥ 0.5 µM, which is only reached in vivo after administration of high bulevirtide doses (10 \nmg subcutaneous). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. As a precautionary measure, \nclose clinical monitoring is warranted when OATP1B1/3 substrates (e.g. atorvastatin, bosentan, \n\n\n\n5 \n\ndocetaxel, fexofenadine, glecaprevir, glyburide (glibenclamide), grazoprevir, nateglinide, paclitaxel, \nparitaprevir, pitavastatin, pravastatin, repaglinide, rosuvastatin, simeprevir, simvastatin, olmesartan, \ntelmisartan, valsartan, voxilaprevir) are co-administered. When possible, co-administration of these \nsubstrates should be avoided. \n \nIn a clinical study in healthy subjects, co-administration of tenofovir and bulevirtide revealed no impact \non tenofovir pharmacokinetic. \n \nNo CYP inhibition by bulevirtide was observed in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. However, \nin a clinical study, an approximately 40% increase in geometric mean of partial AUC2-4h values of co-\nadministered midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) was observed in combination of high dose bulevirtide (10 \nmg) and tenofovir (245 mg), whereas no significant influence on midazolam AUC2-4h was detected for \ntenofovir alone. As a precautionary measure, close clinical monitoring is warranted for co-administered \nnarrow-therapeutic-index drugs which are sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. cyclosporine, \ncarbamazepine, simvastatin, sirolimus, and tacrolimus).  \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of bulevirtide in pregnant women.  \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. \n  \nAs a precautious measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of bulevirtide during pregnancy and in women \nof child-bearing age who do not use contraception. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether bulevirtide is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, a decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue / abstain from treatment with bulevirtide, taking \ninto account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child with regard to the benefit of treatment for the \nmother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of bulevirtide on fertility are available. In animal studies, no effects of \nbulevirtide on male or female mating and fertility were noted. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe product has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed \nthat dizziness has been reported during treatment with bulevirtide. (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were asymptomatic, dose dependent and reversible (after \ndiscontinuation of treatment) increase in bile salts (very common) and injection site reactions (common) \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nThe most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was an exacerbation of hepatitis after \ndiscontinuation of bulevirtide, possibly related to virologic rebound after discontinuation of treatment \n(see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nCommon and very common adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100, <1/10). \n \n\nMed DRA System Organ Class Adverse reactions \nVery common (≥ 1/10) Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Anaemia \nEosinophilia  \nLeukopenia \nLymphopenia  \nNeutropenia \nReticulocytopenia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders  Dizziness  \nHeadache \nSomnolence \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \nGastrointestinal disorders  Abdominal distention  \n\nNausea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Erythema \nHyperhidrosis \nPruritus \nRash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Arthralgia  \nMuscle spasms \n\nRenal and urinary disorders   Haematuria \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Fatigue \nInfluenza like illness \nInjection site erythema \nInjection site haematoma \nInjection site pruritus \nInjection site dermatitis \nLocal reaction \n\nInvestigations Total bile salt increased ALT increased \nAmylase increased  \nAST increased \nBlood bilirubin increased \nBlood creatinine increased \nGGT increased \nHaemoglobin decreased \nINR increased \nLipase increased \nNeutrophil count decreased \n\n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions: \n\nALT elevations \n\nMost ALT elevations were reported after treatment cessation and may be related to hepatitis \nexacerbation after withdrawal of antiviral treatment.  \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no data on human overdose with bulevirtide. If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored \nfor evidence of toxicity and given standard supportive treatment as necessary. \n  \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals. ATC code:  J05AX28 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBulevirtide blocks the entry of HBV and HDV into hepatocytes by binding to and inactivating NTCP, \na bile salt liver transporter serving as essential HBV/HDV entry receptor. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of bulevirtide was investigated in two Phase 2 studies. Patients with \nchronic HDV infection and active hepatitis were included. The population of both studies was mainly \nCaucasian, HDV genotype 1 was predominant. \n \nMYR 202 study \nA multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 2 clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of three \ndoses of bulevirtide (2 mg/day, 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day) for 24 weeks in patients with chronic hepatitis \nD with liver cirrhosis, or who failed previous interferon therapy, or for whom such therapy was \ncontraindicated (including history of interferon intolerance). Study participants received either daily \nsubcutaneous injections of bulevirtide 2 mg/day, 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day on top of tenofovir (tablets), \nor tenofovir alone for 24 weeks. 50% of the study participants had liver cirrhosis at baseline. Participants \nhad compensated liver disease, mean age was 40.2 (9.5) years, 66.9% were male, 85.6% were \nCaucasians, 13.6% Asians and 0.8% Black. Patients had active hepatitis with mean levels ALT of 115 \n(79.5) U/L. Patients with HIV and active HCV infection were excluded. Baseline characteristics were \ncomparable between treatment arms. The primary endpoint of the study was undetectable HDV RNA \nor decrease by ≥2log10 from baseline to week 24.  \n \n \nThe table below summarises the efficacy results in mITT population at week 24: \n\nHDV RNA response  Arm A:  \n(n=28) \n2mg \nbulevirtide + \nTDF \n\nArm B: \n(n=32) \n5mg \nbulevirtide + \nTDF \n\nArm C:  \n(n=30) \n10mg \nbulevirtide + \nTDF \n\nArm \nD: \n (n=28) \nTDF \n\nPatients with undetectable \nHDV RNA or decrease by \n≥2log10 from baseline to \nweek 24,  \n\n53.6 %* 50.0% * 76.7%* 3.6% \n\nPatients with undetectable \nHDV RNA or decline by 21.4%* 28.1% * 36.7% * 0.0% \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n>2log10 and normal ALT at \nweek 24 \n\nPatients with ALT \nnormalisation 42.9%* 50.0%* 40.0%* 7.1% \n\n*p-value ≤ 0.05 TDF=tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \nALT values ≤31 U/L for female and ≤41 U/L for male were considered normal \n \nIn this study, 25 participants developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA).

In this limited \ndataset, the efficacy and safety profiles were not substantially different than for patients treated for 24 \nweeks. Two subjects developed virological breakthrough, possibly related to medication non-adherence.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nHepcludex in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D \ninfection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means \nthat further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of bulevirtide were characterised after intravenous and subcutaneous \nadministration. The exposure of bulevirtide increased disproportionally while the clearance and volume \nof distribution decreased with higher doses.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe estimated volume of distribution is smaller than total body water. In vitro plasma protein binding \nis high with >99% of bulevirtide bound to plasma proteins.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNo biotransformation study was performed for bulevirtide. Bulevirtide is a linear peptide consisting of \nL-amino acids, and it is expected to be degraded to smaller peptides and individual amino acids. No \nactive metabolites are expected. \n \nBased on the results of in vitro interaction studies, bulevirtide did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  \n\nNo in vitro induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 by bulevirtide was observed.   \n\nBased on the in vitro studies, no clinically relevant interaction is expected for most common efflux \ntransporters (MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2K) and uptake transporters (OATP2B1, \nOAT1, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2). A specific in vitro interaction was identified with the organic anion \ntransporting polypeptides, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 with IC50 values of 0.5 and 8.7µM, respectively.  \n \nElimination \nNo bulevirtide excretion into urine was detected in healthy volunteers. Elimination via target (NTCP) \nbinding is assumed to be the main route. Both distribution and elimination after multiple dosing were \nreduced compared to values estimated after the first dose. Accumulation ratios for 2 mg dose for Cmax \nand AUC were approximately 2-fold. Steady state is assumed to be achieved within the first weeks of \nadministration. After reaching peak concentrations, plasma levels declined with t1/2 of 4-7 hours. \n \n \nRenal impairment \nNo studies have been conducted with bulevirtide in patients with renal impairment.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo studies have been conducted with bulevirtide in patients with moderate and severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nElderly \nNo data is available in patients older than 65 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data is available in patients younger than 18 years of age.  \n \n \n \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nNo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted due to the nature and mechanism of action \nof the product. \n \nA pre- and post-natal development study (PPND) has been completed in rats and did not show any \nbulevirtide-related toxicity. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Hepcludex \n3. How to take Hepcludex \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Hepcludex \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Step-by-step injection guide  \n \n\n1. What Hepcludex is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Hepcludex is \nHepcludex contains the active substance bulevirtide, which is an antiviral medicine. \n \nWhat Hepcludex is used for \nHepcludex is used to treat long-term (chronic) hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in adults with \ncompensated liver disease (when the liver is still working well enough). Infection with hepatitis delta \nvirus causes inflammation of the liver. \n  \nHow Hepcludex works \nHDV uses a particular protein in liver cells to enter the cells. Bulevirtide, the active substance in this \nmedicine blocks the protein and so prevents the HDV from getting into liver cells. This reduces the \nspread of HDV in the liver and reduces inflammation.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Hepcludex \n \n\nDo not take Hepcludex: \n- if you are allergic to bulevirtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n \nIf you are not sure, speak to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nDo not stop your treatment with Hepcludex unless your doctor advises you to do so. Stopping the \ntreatment can reactivate the infection and worsen your disease. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Hepcludex:  \n \n\n• if your liver is not working well enough – it is not known how well Hepcludex works in these \ncircumstances; if your liver is not functioning well, taking Hepcludex is not recommended. \n \n\n• if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys. Before and \nduring treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to check how well your kidneys are \nworking; \n\n \n• if you have HIV infection or hepatitis C - it is not known how well Hepcludex works in these \n\ncircumstances; your doctor may order blood tests to check the status of your HIV or hepatitis C \ninfection \n\n \n• if you get reactions such as swelling, redness, irritation, bruising, itchiness, infection or pain at \n\nthe injection site – this medicine is given by injection under the skin. \n \n• if you have an elevation of bile acids in the blood. Hepcludex increases the level of bile acids in \n\nthe blood – the long-term effect of bile acid elevation is not known.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nChildren and adolescents under 18 years of age should not be treated with Hepcludex. \n \nOther medicines and Hepcludex \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n \nSome medicines can increase side effects of Hepcludex and you should not take them at the same time. \nThis is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines:  \n \n\n• ciclosporin, a medicine that supresses the immune system; \n• ezetimibe, used for treating high blood cholesterol; \n• irbesartan, used for treating high blood pressure and heart disease; \n• ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection; \n• sulfasalazine, (used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. \n\n \nSome medicines can increase or decrease the effects of Hepcludex when taken together.

The vials \ncan be stored for not \nmore than 3 months. \n\n1C \nWash hands \n\nWash your hands \nwell using soap and \nwarm water and dry  \nthem with a clean \ntowel. \nOnce your hands are \nclean,   \ndo not touch \nanything else other \nthan the medicine,  \nsupplies and the \narea around the \ninjection site. \n\n1D \nClean vial \n\n \nWipe the vial top \nwith a new alcohol \npad and let the top   \nair-dry. \nIf you touch the \nrubber top- after \ncleaning it, clean  \nit again with a new \nalcohol pad. \n\nAbdomen Upper thighs \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n2A \nDraw up sterile water \n\n2B \nInject water into the \npowder \n\n2C \nGently mix bulevirtide \n\nPick up the syringe.

Be sure the capped needle is tight by \npushing it down slightly while twisting it \nclockwise. \n \nPull off the plastic cap. \n \nOpen the water for injection. Insert the needle in the \nvial and gently turn the water vial upside down. \nMake sure the tip of the needle is always below the \nsurface of the water to help keep air bubbles from \nentering the syringe. \n  \nSlowly pull the plunger back to get 1.0 cc/ml of \nsterile water into the syringe. Carefully remove the \nneedle and syringe from the vial. \n\nGently tap the \nbulevirtide vial to loosen \nthe powder. \nInsert the needle with \nsterile water into the \nbulevirtide vial at an \nangle. \nInject the sterile water \nslowly, so it can drip \ndown the side   \nof the vial into the \nbulevirtide powder. \n\nGently tap the \nbulevirtide vial with \nyour fingertip for 10 sec \nto start dissolving the \npowder.  Then gently \nroll the bulevirtide vial \nbetween your hands to \nensure thorough \nmixing. Make sure no \nbulevirtide powder is \nstuck to the vial wall. \nImportant! Do not \nshake the bulevirtide \nvial. Shaking will make \nthe medicine foam   \nand it will take much \nlonger to dissolve. \n\n2D \nInspect bulevirtide \n\n2E \nBulevirtide ready for injection \n\nOnce the powder starts \nto dissolve, just set it \naside and it completely \nwill dissolve. \nAfter tapping, it could \ntake up to 3 min to \ndissolve.  \n\nWhen mixed completely, the bulevirtide solution should be clear. \nImportant! Completely dissolved bulevirtide should be clear and without foam. \nIf the bulevirtide solution appears foamy or yellowish, allow more time for it to \ndissolve. \nIf you see bubbles, gently tap the vial until they disappear. \nIf you see any particles in   \nthe bulevirtide solution once it is (completely) dissolved, do not   \nuse that vial. Contact your doctor or pharmacist that provided it. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n3A \nInsert needle into vial \n \n\n3B \nDraw up bulevirtide \n \n\n3C \nFinishing preparation \n\n3D Change and \ndiscard the needle \n\nPick up the syringe. \n \nInsert the needle into the \nvial of liquid \nbulevirtide. \n\nGently turn the vial \nupside down. Make \nsure the tip of   \nthe needle is always \nbelow the surface of the \nbulevirtide solution to \nhelp keep air bubbles \nfrom entering the \nsyringe. Slowly pull the \nplunger to get  \n1.0 cc/ml of bulevirtide. \n\nGently tap or flick the \nsyringe and push/pull \nthe plunger to remove \nextra air and bubbles. To \nbe sure you end \nup with 1.0 cc/ml of \nbulevirtide in the \nsyringe, you may need   \nto pull the plunger past \nthe \n1.0 cc/ml mark. \nCarefully remove the \nneedle and syringe from \nthe vial. \n\nRemove the longer \nneedle from the syringe \nand dispose of it \nproperly so that nobody \ncan be injured. \nImportant!
