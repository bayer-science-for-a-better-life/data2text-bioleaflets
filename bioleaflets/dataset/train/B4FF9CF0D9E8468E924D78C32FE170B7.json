NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma 5 mg solution for infusion in bottles \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach bottle with 100 ml of solution contains 5 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n \nEach ml of the solution contains 0.05 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis  \n\u2022 in post-menopausal women  \n\u2022 in adult men  \nat increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture. \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  \n\u2022 in post-menopausal women  \n\u2022 in adult men  \nat increased risk of fracture.  \n \nTreatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \nPatients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. This \nis especially important for the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. \n \nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma administration. \n \nOsteoporosis \nFor the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, osteoporosis in men and the treatment of \nosteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy, the recommended dose is a \nsingle intravenous infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma administered once a year. \n \nThe optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need \nfor continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. \n \nIn patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, it is recommended to give the zoledronic acid \ninfusion at least two weeks after hip fracture repair (see section 5.1). In patients with a recent low-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\ntrauma hip fracture, a loading dose of 50 000 to 125 000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the \nintramuscular route is recommended prior to the first zoledronic acid infusion. \n \nPaget\u2019s disease \nFor the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease, Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should be prescribed only by \nphysicians with experience in the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. The recommended dose is a \nsingle intravenous infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. In patients with Paget\u2019s disease, it \nis strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental \ncalcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma \nadministration (see section 4.4). \n \nRe-treatment of Paget\u2019s disease: After initial treatment with zoledronic acid in Paget\u2019s disease, an \nextended remission period is observed in responding patients. Re-treatment consists of an additional \nintravenous infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma after an interval of one year or longer from \ninitial treatment in patients who have relapsed. Limited data on re-treatment of Paget\u2019s disease are \navailable (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance \u2265 35 ml/min. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in \nelderly patients and younger subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use. \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is administered via a vented infusion line and given slowly at a constant \ninfusion rate. The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes. For information on the infusion of \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma, see section 6.6. \n \nPatients treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should be given the package leaflet and the patient \nreminder card. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients, \n\nlisted in section 6.1. \n \n- Patients with hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n- Severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \n- Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal function \nThe use of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an increased risk of renal failure in this population. \n \nRenal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8), \nespecially in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or other risks including advanced age, \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy (see section 4.5), or \ndehydration occurring after zoledronic acid administration. Renal impairment has been observed in \npatients after a single administration. Renal failure requiring dialysis or with a fatal outcome has rarely \noccurred in patients with underlying renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described above. \n \nThe following precautions should be taken into account to minimise the risk of renal adverse \nreactions: \n\u2022 Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using the \n\nCockcroft-Gault formula before each Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma dose.  \n\u2022 Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with underlying impaired renal \n\nfunction.  \n\u2022 Monitoring of serum creatinine should be considered in at-risk patients.  \n\u2022 Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should be used with caution when concomitantly used with other \n\nmedicinal products that could impact renal function (see section 4.5).  \n\u2022 Patients, especially elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy, should be appropriately \n\nhydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma.  \n\u2022 A single dose of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of \n\ninfusion should be at least 15 minutes (see section 4.2).  \n \nHypocalcaemia \nPre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before \ninitiating therapy with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma (see section 4.3). Other disturbances of mineral \nmetabolism must also be effectively treated (e.g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium \nmalabsorption). Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients. \n \nElevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. Due to the rapid onset of \neffect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may \ndevelop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma \n(see section 4.8). \n \nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma administration. In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate \nsupplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at \nleast 10 days following Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma administration (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical \nmonitoring during the period of risk. Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Zoledronic \nacid Teva Pharma is recommended for patients with Paget\u00b4s disease. \n \nSevere and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported \nin patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.8). \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)  \nONJ has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma for osteoporosis (see section 4.8). \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual \nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma in \npatients with concomitant risk factors. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe following should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ: \n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures, e.g. tooth extractions. \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed with caution and avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid \ntreatment. \n \nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nGeneral \nThe incidence of post-dose symptoms occuring within the first three days after administration of \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen \nshortly following Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma administration. \n \nOther products containing zoledronic acid as an active substance are available for oncology \nindications. Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should not be treated with such \nproducts or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the combined effects of these agents are \nunknown. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 ml, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium\u2013free.\u201d \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. Zoledronic acid is not \nsystemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro (see \nsection 5.2).  Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) \nand interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are therefore unlikely. \n \nZoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion. Caution is indicated when Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal \nfunction (e.g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration) (see section 4.4). \n \nIn patients with renal impairment, the systemic exposure to concomitant medicinal products that are \nprimarily excreted via the kidney may increase. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is not recommended in women of childbearing potential. \n \nPregnancy \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). There are no \nadequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in animals with zoledronic \nacid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations (see section 5.3). The \npotential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is unknown \nwhether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. \n \nFertility \nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered related to the compound\u2019s \ninhibition of skeletal calcium mobilisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness, may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall percentage of patients who experienced adverse reactions were 44.7%, 16.7% and 10.2% \nafter the first, second and third infusion, respectively.  Incidence of individual adverse reactions \nfollowing the first infusion was: pyrexia (17.1%), myalgia (7.8%), influenza-like illness (6.7%), \narthralgia (4.8%) and headache (5.1%). The incidence of these reactions decreased markedly with \nsubsequent annual doses of zoledronic acid. The majority of these reactions occur within the first three \ndays following zoledronic acid administration. The majority of these reactions were mild to moderate \nand resolved within three days of the event onset. The percentage of patients who experienced adverse \nreactions was lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, second and third infusion, \nrespectively), where prophylaxis against adverse reactions was used. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory.

The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(0.6%) (22 out of 3,852). The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is \nunknown. In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled \natrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between zoledronic acid (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%). For \natrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for zoledronic acid and 0.8% \nfor placebo. \n \nClass effects:  \nRenal impairment \nZoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment manifested as deterioration in renal \nfunction (i.e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure. Renal impairment has \nbeen observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing \nrenal dysfunction or additional risk factors (e.g. advanced age, oncology patients with chemotherapy, \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy, severe dehydration), with \nthe majority of them receiving a 4 mg dose every 3-4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after \na single administration. \n \nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) \nand the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the zoledronic acid and \nplacebo treatment groups over three years. There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed \nwithin 10 days in 1.8% of zoledronic acid-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients.  \n \nHypocalcaemia \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium \nlevels (less than 1.87 mmol/l) following zoledronic acid administration. No symptomatic cases of \nhypocalcaemia were observed. \n \nIn the Paget\u2019s disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of \npatients, in all of whom it resolved.  \n \nBased on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference \nrange (less than 2.10 mmol/l) occurred in 2.3% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in a large clinical \ntrial compared to 21% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in the Paget\u2019s disease trials. The frequency \nof hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions.  \n \nAll patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal \nosteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget\u2019s disease \ntrials (see also section 4.2). In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip \nfracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading \ndose of vitamin D prior to zoledronic acid administration (see section 4.2). \n \nLocal reactions \nIn a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/or pain, were \nreported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid.  \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw  \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). In a large \nclinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with \nzoledronic acid and one patient treated with placebo.  Cases of ONJ have been reported in the post-\nmarketing setting for Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nClinical experience with acute overdose is limited. Patients who have received doses higher than those \nrecommended should be carefully monitored. In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant \nhypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/or an intravenous \ninfusion of calcium gluconate. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: \nM05BA08 \n \nMechanism of action \nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on \nbone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\ufffd\n\n\n10 \n\nThe main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate \nsynthase. The long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity for \nthe active site of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase and its strong binding affinity to bone \nmineral. \n \nZoledronic acid treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal \nlevels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days, and for formation markers at 12 weeks. \nThereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range. There was no progressive \nreduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing. \n \nClinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT)  \nThe efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated \nin post-menopausal women (7,736 women aged 65-89 years) with either: a femoral neck bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) with a T-score \u2264 \u20131.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral \nfracture(s); or a femoral neck BMD T-score \u2264 \u20132.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral \nfracture(s). 85% of patients were bisphosphonate-na\u00efve. Women who were evaluated for the incidence \nof vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy, which was allowed for women \ncontributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations. Concomitant osteoporosis therapy \nincluded: calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, tibolone; but excluded other \nbisphosphonates. All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of \nvitamin D supplements daily. \n \nEffect on morphometric vertebral fractures  \nZoledronic acid significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three \nyears and as early as the one year timepoint (see Table 2). \n \nTable 2  Summary of vertebral fracture efficacy at 12, 24 and 36 months \n \n\nOutcome  Zoledronic \nacid (%) \n\nPlacebo \n(%) \n\nAbsolute reduction \nin fracture \n\nincidence % (CI) \n\nRelative reduction \nin fracture \n\nincidence % (CI) \nAt least one new vertebral \nfracture (0\u20131 year) \n\n1.5 3.7 2.2 (1.4, 3.1) 60 (43, 72)** \n\nAt least one new vertebral \nfracture (0\u20132 year) \n\n2.2 7.7 5.5 (4.4, 6.6) 71 (62, 78)** \n\nAt least one new vertebral \nfracture (0\u20133 year) \n\n3.3 10.9 7.6 (6.3, 9.0) 70 (62, 76)** \n\n** p <0.0001 \n \nZoledronic acid-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60% reduction in the risk of \nvertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p<0.0001). \n \nEffect on hip fractures  \nZoledronic acid demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years, resulting in a 41% reduction in the risk \nof hip fractures (95% CI, 17% to 58%). The hip fracture event rate was 1.44% for zoledronic acid-\ntreated patients compared to 2.49% for placebo-treated patients. The risk reduction was 51% in \nbisphosphonate-na\u00efve patients and 42% in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy. \n \nEffect on all clinical fractures  \nAll clinical fractures were verified based on the radiographic and/or clinical evidence. A summary of \nresults is presented in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3  Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables \n\nover 3 years \n \nOutcome Zoledronic Placebo Absolute reduction Relative risk \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nacid \n(N=3,875) \nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\n(N=3,861) \nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nin fracture event rate \n%  \n\n(CI) \n\nreduction in \nfracture incidence \n\n% (CI) \n\nAny clinical fracture (1) 8.4 12.8 4.4 (3.0, 5.8) 33 (23, 42)** \nClinical vertebral fracture (2) 0.5 2.6 2.1 (1.5, 2.7) 77 (63, 86)** \nNon-vertebral fracture (1) 8.0 10.7 2.7 (1.4, 4.0) 25 (13, 36)* \n*p-value <0.001, **p-value <0.0001 \n(1) Excluding finger, toe and facial fractures \n(2) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures \n \nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD)  \nZoledronic acid significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and distal radius relative to \ntreatment with placebo at all timepoints (6, 12, 24 and 36 months). Treatment with zoledronic acid \nresulted in a 6.7% increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0% at the total hip, 5.1% at the femoral \nneck, and 3.2% at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo. \n \nBone histology \nBone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in \n152 post-menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with zoledronic acid (N=82) or placebo \n(N=70). Histomorphometric analysis showed a 63% reduction in bone turnover.  In patients treated \nwith zoledronic acid, no osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected. \nTetracycline label was detectable in all but one of 82 biopsies obtained from patients on zoledronic \nacid. Microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and \npreservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with zoledronic acid compared to \nplacebo. \n \nBone turnover markers  \nBone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) \nand serum beta-C-telopeptides (b-CTx) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients \nat periodic intervals throughout the study. Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of zoledronic acid \nsignificantly reduced BSAP by 30% relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28% \nbelow baseline levels at 36 months. P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at \n12 months and was sustained at 52% below baseline levels at 36 months. B-CTx was significantly \nreduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55% below baseline levels at \n36 months. During this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal \nrange at the end of each year. Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover \nmarkers.  \n \nEffect on height  \nIn the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer.  The \nzoledronic acid group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo (95% \nCI: 1.6 mm, 3.5 mm) [p<0.0001]. \n \nDays of disability  \nZoledronic acid significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to \nback pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the \nmean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days \nrespectively compared to placebo (all p<0.01). \n \nClinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent \nhip fracture (RFT) \nThe incidence of clinical fractures, including vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures, was evaluated \nin 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years (mean age 74.5 years) with a recent (within 90 days) low-\ntrauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study treatment. Approximately \n42% of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45% of the patients \nhad a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5. Zoledronic acid was administered once a year, until at \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nleast 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures. Vitamin D levels were not \nroutinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the \nintramuscular route) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion. All participants \nreceived 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation \nper day. Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip \nfracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture \nrepair. The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the \nstudy. \n \nEffect on all clinical fractures \nThe incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4. \n \nTable 4 Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables \n \nOutcome Zoledronic \n\nacid \n(N=1,065) \nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=1,062) \nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nAbsolute reduction \nin fracture event \n\nrate % \n(CI) \n\nRelative risk \nreduction in \n\nfracture incidence \n% (CI) \n\nAny clinical fracture (1) 8.6 13.9 5.3 (2.3, 8.3) 35 (16, 50)** \nClinical vertebral fracture (2) 1.7 3.8 2.1 (0.5, 3.7) 46 (8, 68)* \nNon-vertebral fracture (1) 7.6 10.7 3.1 (0.3, 5.9) 27 (2, 45)* \n*p-value <0.05, **p-value <0.01 \n(1) Excluding finger, toe and facial fractures \n(2) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures \n \nThe study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture, but a trend was seen \ntowards reduction in new hip fractures. \n \nAll cause mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the zoledronic acid-treated group compared to 13% \n(141 patients) in the placebo group. This corresponds to a 28% reduction in the risk of all cause \nmortality (p=0.01). \n \nThe incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between zoledronic acid (34 [3.2%]) \nand placebo (29 [2.7%]). \n \nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD) \nIn the HORIZON-RFT study zoledronic acid treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip \nand femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints. Treatment with zoledronic acid \nresulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4% at the total hip and 4.3% at the femoral neck over 24 months \nas compared to placebo. \n \nClinical efficacy in men  \nIn the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD \nassessed at 24 months. At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6% in total hip BMD was \nobserved for patients treated with zoledronic acid as compared to the effects observed in post-\nmenopausal women in the HORIZON-PFT study. The study was not powered to show a reduction in \nclinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with zoledronic \nacid versus 8.7% for placebo. \n \nIn another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) an annual infusion of zoledronic acid was non-\ninferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to \nbaseline. \n \nClinical efficacy in osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  \nThe efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis associated \nwith long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy were assessed in a randomised, multicentre, double-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nblind, stratified, active-controlled study of 833 men and women aged 18-85 years (mean age for men \n56.4 years; for women 53.5 years) treated with > 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent). Patients \nwere stratified with respect to duration of glucocorticoid use prior to randomisation (\u2264 3 months \nversus > 3 months). The duration of the trial was one year. Patients were randomised to either \nzoledronic acid 5 mg single infusion or to oral risedronate 5 mg daily for one year. All participants \nreceived 1,000 mg elemental calcium plus 400 to 1,000 IU vitamin D supplementation per day.  \nEfficacy was demonstrated if non-inferiority to risedronate was shown sequentially with respect to the \npercentage change in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months relative to baseline in the treatment and \nprevention subpopulations, respectively. The majority of patients continued to receive glucocorticoids \nfor the one year duration of the trial.  \n \nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD)  \nThe increases in BMD were significantly greater in the zoledronic acid-treated group at the lumbar \nspine and femoral neck at 12 months compared to risedronate (all p<0.03). In the subpopulation of \npatients receiving glucocorticoids for more than 3 months prior to randomisation, zoledronic acid \nincreased lumbar spine BMD by 4.06% versus 2.71% for risedronate (mean difference: 1.36%; \np<0.001). In the subpopulation of patients that had received glucocorticoids for 3 months or less prior \nto randomisation, zoledronic acid increased lumbar spine BMD by 2.60% versus 0.64% for risedronate \n(mean difference: 1.96%; p<0.001). The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical \nfractures compared to risedronate. The incidence of fractures was 8 for zoledronic acid-treated patients \nversus 7 for risedronate-treated patients (p=0.8055).  \n \nClinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone  \nZoledronic acid was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to \nmoderate Paget\u2019s disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6-3.0 times the \nupper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by \nradiographic evidence. \n \nThe efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for \n2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials.  After 6 months, zoledronic acid \nshowed 96% (169/176) and 89% (156/176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) \nnormalisation rates compared to 74% (127/171) and 58% (99/171) for risedronate (all p<0.001). \n \nIn the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to \nbaseline were observed over 6 months for zoledronic acid and risedronate. \n \nPatients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter \nan extended follow-up period. Of the 153 zoledronic acid-treated patients and 115 risedronate-treated \npatients who entered an extended observation study, after a mean duration of follow-up of 3.8 years \nfrom time of dosing, the proportion of patients ending the Extended Observation Period due to the \nneed for re-treatment (clinical judgment) was higher for risedronate (48 patients, or 41.7%) compared \nwith zoledronic acid (11 patients, or 7.2%). The mean time of ending the Extended Observation Period \ndue to the need for Paget\u2019s re-treatment from the initial dose was longer for zoledronic acid (7.7 years) \nthan for risedronate (5.1 years). \n \nSix patients who achieved therapeutic response 6 months after treatment with zoledronic acid and later \nexperienced disease relapse during the extended follow-up period were re-treated with zoledronic acid \nafter a mean time of 6.5 years from initial treatment to re-treatment. Five of the 6 patients had SAP \nwithin the normal range at month 6 (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF). \n \nBone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget\u2019s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg \nzoledronic acid.  Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired \nbone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects. These results were consistent with \nbiochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nPaget\u2019s disease of the bone, osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at an increased risk of fracture, \nosteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture and prevention of clinical fractures after a hip fracture \nin men and women (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nyielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent. \n \nDistribution \nAfter initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased \nrapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of \npeak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels.  \n \nElimination \nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t\u00bd\u03b1 0.24 and t\u00bd\u03b2 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t\u00bd\u03b3 146 hours. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. The early \ndisposition phases (\u03b1 and \u03b2, with t\u00bd values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys.  \n \nZoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, \n39 \u00b1 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound \nto bone tissue. This uptake into bone is common for all bisphosphonates and is presumably a \nconsequence of the structural analogy to pyrophosphate. As with other bisphosphonates, the retention \ntime of zoledronic acid in bones is very long. From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into \nthe systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 \u00b1 2.5 l/h, \nindependent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight. The inter- and intra-subject \nvariation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36% and 34%, respectively. \nIncreasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid \nconcentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration \nversus time curve. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships \nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with zoledronic acid. Since \nzoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity \nas a direct-acting and/or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic \nacid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme systems. Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins \n(approximately 43-55% bound) and binding is concentration independent. Therefore, interactions \nresulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely.  \n \nSpecial populations (see section 4.2)  \nRenal impairment \nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 \u00b1 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 \u00b1 29 ml/min (range \n22 to 143 ml/min) in the 64 patients studied. Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to \n40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack \nof accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that dose \nadjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50-80 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/min are not necessary. The use of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma in \npatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an \nincreased risk of renal failure in this population. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nAcute toxicity \nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats.  In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic \nexposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects.  \n \nSubchronic and chronic toxicity  \nIn the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when \ngiven 0.6 mg/kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that \ncorresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute \ninfusions of 0.25 mg/kg administered at 2-3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to \n7 times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs. In the intravenous bolus studies, \nthe doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration: 0.2 and 0.02 mg/kg daily \nwas well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs, respectively but only 0.01 mg/kg and 0.005 mg/kg in \nrats and dogs, respectively, when given for 52 weeks.  \n \nLonger-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum \nintended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal \ntract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration. The clinical relevance of these findings is \nunknown. The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary \nspongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that \nreflected the compound\u2019s pharmacological antiresorptive activity.  \n \nReproduction toxicity  \nTeratology studies were performed in two species, both via subcutaneous administration. \nTeratogenicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 0.2 mg/kg and was manifested by external, visceral and \nskeletal malformations. Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg body weight) tested in \nrats.  No teratological or embryo/foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity \nwas marked at 0.1 mg/kg due to decreased serum calcium levels.  \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential  \nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis  \n\u2022 in post-menopausal women  \n\u2022 in adult men  \nat increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture. \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  \n\u2022 in post-menopausal women  \n\u2022 in adult men  \nat increased risk of fracture.  \n \nTreatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone in adults. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \nPatients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. This \nis especially important for the elderly (\u2265 65 years) and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. \n \nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma administration. \n \nOsteoporosis \nFor the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, osteoporosis in men and the treatment of \nosteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy, the recommended dose is a \nsingle intravenous infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma administered once a year. \n \nThe optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need \nfor continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, it is recommended to give the zoledronic acid \ninfusion at least two weeks after hip fracture repair (see section 5.1). In patients with a recent low-\ntrauma hip fracture, a loading dose of 50 000 to 125 000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the \nintramuscular route is recommended prior to the first zoledronic acid infusion. \n \nPaget\u2019s disease \nFor the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease, Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should be prescribed only by \nphysicians with experience in the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. The recommended dose is a \nsingle intravenous infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. In patients with Paget\u2019s disease, it \nis strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental \ncalcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma \nadministration (see section 4.4). \n \nRe-treatment of Paget\u2019s disease: After initial treatment with zoledronic acid in Paget\u2019s disease, an \nextended remission period is observed in responding patients. Re-treatment consists of an additional \nintravenous infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma after an interval of one year or longer from \ninitial treatment in patients who have relapsed. Limited data on re-treatment of Paget\u2019s disease are \navailable (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance \u2265 35 ml/min. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in \nelderly patients and younger subjects. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \nIntravenous use. \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is administered via a vented infusion line and given slowly at a constant \ninfusion rate. The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes.

Renal impairment has been observed in \npatients after a single administration. Renal failure requiring dialysis or with a fatal outcome has rarely \noccurred in patients with underlying renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described above. \n \nThe following precautions should be taken into account to minimise the risk of renal adverse \nreactions:  \n\u2022 Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using the \n\nCockcroft-Gault formula before each Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma dose.  \n\u2022 Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with underlying impaired renal \n\nfunction.  \n\u2022 Monitoring of serum creatinine should be considered in at-risk patients.  \n\u2022 Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should be used with caution when concomitantly used with other \n\nmedicinal products that could impact renal function (see section 4.5).  \n\u2022 Patients, especially elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy, should be appropriately \n\nhydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma.  \n\u2022 A single dose of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of \n\ninfusion should be at least 15 minutes (see section 4.2).  \n \nHypocalcaemia \nPre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before \ninitiating therapy with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma (see section 4.3). Other disturbances of mineral \nmetabolism must also be effectively treated (e.g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium \nmalabsorption). Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients. \n \nElevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. Due to the rapid onset of \neffect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may \ndevelop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma \n(see section 4.8). \n \nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma administration. In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate \nsupplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at \nleast 10 days following Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma administration (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical \nmonitoring during the period of risk. Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Zoledronic \nacid Teva Pharma is recommended for patients with Paget\u00b4s disease. \n \nSevere and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported \nin patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.8). \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)  \nONJ has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma for osteoporosis (see section 4.8). \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual \nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\npatients with concomitant risk factors. \n \nThe following should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ: \n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures, e.g. tooth extractions. \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed with caution and avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid \ntreatment. \n \nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nGeneral \nThe incidence of post-dose symptoms occuring within the first three days after administration of \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen \nshortly following Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma administration. \n \nOther products containing zoledronic acid as an active substance are available for oncology \nindications. Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should not be treated with such \nproducts or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the combined effects of these agents are \nunknown. \n \nExcipients \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 ml, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium\u2013free.\u201d \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. Zoledronic acid is not \nsystemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro (see \nsection 5.2). Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) \nand interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are therefore unlikely. \n \nZoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion. Caution is indicated when Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal \nfunction (e.g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration) (see section 4.4). \n \nIn patients with renal impairment, the systemic exposure to concomitant medicinal products that are \nprimarily excreted via the kidney may increase. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is not recommended in women of childbearing potential. \n \nPregnancy  \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). There are no \nadequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in animals with zoledronic \nacid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations (see section 5.3). The \npotential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nBreast-feeding \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is unknown \nwhether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. \n \nFertility \nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered related to the compound\u2019s \ninhibition of skeletal calcium mobilisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness, may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall percentage of patients who experienced adverse reactions were 44.7%, 16.7% and 10.2% \nafter the first, second and third infusion, respectively. Incidence of individual adverse reactions \nfollowing the first infusion was: pyrexia (17.1%), myalgia (7.8%), influenza-like illness (6.7%), \narthralgia (4.8%) and headache (5.1%). The incidence of these reactions decreased markedly with \nsubsequent annual doses of zoledronic acid. The majority of these reactions occur within the first three \ndays following zoledronic acid administration. The majority of these reactions were mild to moderate \nand resolved within three days of the event onset. The percentage of patients who experienced adverse \nreactions was lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, second and third infusion, \nrespectively), where prophylaxis against adverse reactions was used. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory.

The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(0.6%) (22 out of 3,852). The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is \nunknown. In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled \natrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between zoledronic acid (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%). For \natrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for zoledronic acid and 0.8% \nfor placebo. \n \nClass effects:  \nRenal impairment \nZoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment manifested as deterioration in renal \nfunction (i.e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure. Renal impairment has \nbeen observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing \nrenal dysfunction or additional risk factors (e.g. advanced age, oncology patients with chemotherapy, \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy, severe dehydration), with \nthe majority of them receiving a 4 mg dose every 3\u20134 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after \na single administration. \n \nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) \nand the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the zoledronic acid and \nplacebo treatment groups over three years. There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed \nwithin 10 days in 1.8% of zoledronic acid-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nHypocalcaemia \nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium \nlevels (less than 1.87 mmol/l) following zoledronic acid administration. No symptomatic cases of \nhypocalcaemia were observed. \n \nIn the Paget\u2019s disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of \npatients, in all of whom it resolved.  \n \nBased on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference \nrange (less than 2.10 mmol/l) occurred in 2.3% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in a large clinical \ntrial compared to 21% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in the Paget\u2019s disease trials. The frequency \nof hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions.  \n \nAll patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal \nosteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget\u2019s disease \ntrials (see also section 4.2). In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip \nfracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading \ndose of vitamin D prior to zoledronic acid administration (see section 4.2). \n \nLocal reactions \nIn a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/or pain, were \nreported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid.  \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw  \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). In a large \nclinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with \nzoledronic acid and one patient treated with placebo. Cases of ONJ have been reported in the post-\nmarketing setting for Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nClinical experience with acute overdose is limited. Patients who have received doses higher than those \nrecommended should be carefully monitored. In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant \nhypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/or an intravenous \ninfusion of calcium gluconate. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: \nM05BA08 \n \nMechanism of action \nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on \nbone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\ufffd\n\n\n26 \n\nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone. \n \nThe main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate \nsynthase. The long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity for \nthe active site of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase and its strong binding affinity to bone \nmineral. \n \nZoledronic acid treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal \nlevels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days, and for formation markers at 12 weeks. \nThereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range. There was no progressive \nreduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing.  \n \nClinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT)  \nThe efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated \nin post-menopausal women (7,736 women aged 65\u201389 years) with either: a femoral neck bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) with a T-score \u2264 \u20131.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral \nfracture(s); or a femoral neck BMD T-score \u2264 \u20132.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral \nfracture(s). 85% of patients were bisphosphonate-na\u00efve. Women who were evaluated for the incidence \nof vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy, which was allowed for women \ncontributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations. Concomitant osteoporosis therapy \nincluded: calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, tibolone; but excluded other \nbisphosphonates. All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of \nvitamin D supplements daily.  \n \nEffect on morphometric vertebral fractures  \nZoledronic acid significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three \nyears and as early as the one year timepoint (see Table 2). \n \nTable 2  Summary of vertebral fracture efficacy at 12, 24 and 36 months \n \n\nOutcome  Zoledronic \nacid (%) \n\nPlacebo \n(%) \n\nAbsolute reduction \nin fracture \n\nincidence % (CI) \n\nRelative reduction \nin fracture \n\nincidence % (CI) \nAt least one new vertebral \nfracture (0\u20131 year) \n\n1.5 3.7 2.2 (1.4, 3.1) 60 (43, 72)** \n\nAt least one new vertebral \nfracture (0\u20132 year) \n\n2.2 7.7 5.5 (4.4, 6.6) 71 (62, 78)** \n\nAt least one new vertebral \nfracture (0\u20133 year) \n\n3.3 10.9 7.6 (6.3, 9.0) 70 (62, 76)** \n\n** p <0.0001 \n \nZoledronic acid-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60% reduction in the risk of \nvertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p<0.0001). \n \nEffect on hip fractures  \nZoledronic acid demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years, resulting in a 41% reduction in the risk \nof hip fractures (95% CI, 17% to 58%). The hip fracture event rate was 1.44% for zoledronic acid-\ntreated patients compared to 2.49% for placebo-treated patients. The risk reduction was 51% in \nbisphosphonate-na\u00efve patients and 42% in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy. \n \nEffect on all clinical fractures  \nAll clinical fractures were verified based on the radiographic and/or clinical evidence.

Treatment with zoledronic acid \nresulted in a 6.7% increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0% at the total hip, 5.1% at the femoral \nneck, and 3.2% at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo. \n \nBone histology \nBone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in \n152 post-menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with zoledronic acid (N=82) or placebo \n(N=70). Histomorphometric analysis showed a 63% reduction in bone turnover. In patients treated \nwith zoledronic acid, no osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected. \nTetracycline label was detectable in all but one of 82 biopsies obtained from patients on zoledronic \nacid. Microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and \npreservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with zoledronic acid compared to \nplacebo.  \n \nBone turnover markers \nBone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) \nand serum beta-C-telopeptides (b-CTx) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients \nat periodic intervals throughout the study. Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of zoledronic acid \nsignificantly reduced BSAP by 30% relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28% \nbelow baseline levels at 36 months. P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at \n12 months and was sustained at 52% below baseline levels at 36 months. B-CTx was significantly \nreduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55% below baseline levels at \n36 months. During this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal \nrange at the end of each year. Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover \nmarkers.  \n \nEffect on height \nIn the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer. The \nzoledronic acid group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo (95% CI: \n1.6 mm, 3.5 mm) [p<0.0001]. \n \nDays of disability \nZoledronic acid significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to \nback pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the \nmean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days \nrespectively compared to placebo (all p<0.01). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nClinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent \nhip fracture (RFT) \nThe incidence of clinical fractures, including vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures, was evaluated \nin 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years (mean age 74.5 years) with a recent (within 90 days) low-\ntrauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study treatment. Approximately \n42% of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45% of the patients \nhad a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5. Zoledronic acid was administered once a year, until at \nleast 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures. Vitamin D levels were not \nroutinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the \nintramuscular route) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion. All participants \nreceived 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation \nper day. Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip \nfracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture \nrepair. The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the \nstudy. \n \nEffect on all clinical fractures \nThe incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4. \n \nTable 4 Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables \n \nOutcome Zoledronic \n\nacid \n(N=1,065) \nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=1,062) \nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nAbsolute reduction \nin fracture event \n\nrate % \n(CI) \n\nRelative risk \nreduction in \n\nfracture incidence \n% (CI) \n\nAny clinical fracture (1) 8.6 13.9 5.3 (2.3, 8.3) 35 (16, 50)** \nClinical vertebral fracture (2) 1.7 3.8 2.1 (0.5, 3.7) 46 (8, 68)* \nNon-vertebral fracture (1) 7.6 10.7 3.1 (0.3, 5.9) 27 (2, 45)* \n*p-value <0.05, **p-value <0.01 \n(1) Excluding finger, toe and facial fractures \n(2) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures \n \nThe study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture, but a trend was seen \ntowards reduction in new hip fractures. \n \nAll cause mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the zoledronic acid-treated group compared to 13% \n(141 patients) in the placebo group. This corresponds to a 28% reduction in the risk of all cause \nmortality (p=0.01). \n \nThe incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between zoledronic acid (34 [3.2%]) \nand placebo (29 [2.7%]). \n \nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD) \nIn the HORIZON-RFT study zoledronic acid treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip \nand femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints. Treatment with zoledronic acid \nresulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4% at the total hip and 4.3% at the femoral neck over 24 months \nas compared to placebo. \n \nClinical efficacy in men  \nIn the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD \nassessed at 24 months. At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6% in total hip BMD was \nobserved for patients treated with zoledronic acid as compared to the effects observed in post-\nmenopausal women in the HORIZON-PFT study. The study was not powered to show a reduction in \nclinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with zoledronic \nacid versus 8.7% for placebo. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\nIn another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) an annual infusion of zoledronic acid was non-\ninferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to \nbaseline. \n \nClinical efficacy in osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  \nThe efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis associated \nwith long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy were assessed in a randomised, multicentre, double-\nblind, stratified, active-controlled study of 833 men and women aged 18-85 years (mean age for men \n56.4 years; for women 53.5 years) treated with > 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent). Patients \nwere stratified with respect to duration of glucocorticoid use prior to randomisation (\u2264 3 months \nversus > 3 months). The duration of the trial was one year. Patients were randomised to either \nzoledronic acid 5 mg single infusion or to oral risedronate 5 mg daily for one year. All participants \nreceived 1,000 mg elemental calcium plus 400 to 1,000 IU vitamin D supplementation per day. \nEfficacy was demonstrated if non-inferiority to risedronate was shown sequentially with respect to the \npercentage change in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months relative to baseline in the treatment and \nprevention subpopulations, respectively. The majority of patients continued to receive glucocorticoids \nfor the one year duration of the trial.  \n \nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD)  \nThe increases in BMD were significantly greater in the zoledronic acid-treated group at the lumbar \nspine and femoral neck at 12 months compared to risedronate (all p<0.03). In the subpopulation of \npatients receiving glucocorticoids for more than 3 months prior to randomisation, zoledronic acid \nincreased lumbar spine BMD by 4.06% versus 2.71% for risedronate (mean difference: 1.36%; \np<0.001). In the subpopulation of patients that had received glucocorticoids for 3 months or less prior \nto randomisation, zoledronic acid increased lumbar spine BMD by 2.60% versus 0.64% for risedronate \n(mean difference: 1.96% ; p<0.001). The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical \nfractures compared to risedronate. The incidence of fractures was 8 for zoledronic acid-treated patients \nversus 7 for risedronate-treated patients (p=0.8055).  \n \nClinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone  \nZoledronic acid was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to \nmoderate Paget\u2019s disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6-3.0 times the \nupper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by \nradiographic evidence. \n \nThe efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for \n2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials. After 6 months, zoledronic acid \nshowed 96% (169/176) and 89% (156/176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) \nnormalisation rates compared to 74% (127/171) and 58% (99/171) for risedronate (all p<0.001). \n \nIn the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to \nbaseline were observed over 6 months for zoledronic acid and risedronate. \n \nPatients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter \nan extended follow-up period. Of the 153 zoledronic acid-treated patients and 115 risedronate-treated \npatients who entered an extended observation study, after a mean duration of follow-up of 3.8 years \nfrom time of dosing, the proportion of patients ending the Extended Observation Period due to the \nneed for re-treatment (clinical judgment) was higher for risedronate (48 patients, or 41.7%) compared \nwith zoledronic acid (11 patients, or 7.2%). The mean time of ending the Extended Observation Period \ndue to the need for Paget\u2019s re-treatment from the initial dose was longer for zoledronic acid (7.7 years) \nthan for risedronate (5.1 years).  \n \nSix patients who achieved therapeutic response 6 months after treatment with zoledronic acid and later \nexperienced disease relapse during the extended follow-up period were re-treated with zoledronic acid \nafter a mean time of 6.5 years from initial treatment to re-treatment. Five of the 6 patients had SAP \nwithin the normal range at month 6 (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\nBone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget\u2019s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg \nzoledronic acid. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired \nbone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects. These results were consistent with \nbiochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nPaget\u2019s disease of the bone, osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at an increased risk of fracture, \nosteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture and prevention of clinical fractures after a hip fracture \nin men and women (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nyielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent. \n \nDistribution \nAfter initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased \nrapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of \npeak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels. \n \nElimination \nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t\u00bd\u03b1 0.24 and t\u00bd\u03b2 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t\u00bd\u03b3 146 hours. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. The early \ndisposition phases (\u03b1 and \u03b2, with t\u00bd values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys. \n \nZoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, \n39 \u00b1 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound \nto bone tissue. This uptake into bone is common for all bisphosphonates and is presumably a \nconsequence of the structural analogy to pyrophosphate. As with other bisphosphonates, the retention \ntime of zoledronic acid in bones is very long. From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into \nthe systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 \u00b1 2.5 l/h, \nindependent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight. The inter- and intra-subject \nvariation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36% and 34%, respectively. \nIncreasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid \nconcentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration \nversus time curve. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships \nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with zoledronic acid. Since \nzoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity \nas a direct-acting and/or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic \nacid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme systems. Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins \n(approximately 43-55% bound) and binding is concentration independent. Therefore, interactions \nresulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely.  \n \nSpecial populations (see section 4.2)  \nRenal impairment \nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 \u00b1 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 \u00b1 29 ml/min (range \n22 to 143 ml/min) in the 64 patients studied. Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to \n40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\nof accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that dose \nadjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50\u201380 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/min are not necessary. The use of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma in \npatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an \nincreased risk of renal failure in this population. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute toxicity \nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic \nexposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects.  \n \nSubchronic and chronic toxicity  \nIn the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when \ngiven 0.6 mg/kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that \ncorresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute \ninfusions of 0.25 mg/kg administered at 2\u20133-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to \n7 times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs. In the intravenous bolus studies, \nthe doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration: 0.2 and 0.02 mg/kg daily \nwas well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs, respectively but only 0.01 mg/kg and 0.005 mg/kg in \nrats and dogs, respectively, when given for 52 weeks.  \n \nLonger-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum \nintended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal \ntract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration. The clinical relevance of these findings is \nunknown. The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary \nspongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that \nreflected the compound\u2019s pharmacological antiresorptive activity.  \n \nReproduction toxicity  \nTeratology studies were performed in two species, both via subcutaneous administration. \nTeratogenicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 0.2 mg/kg and was manifested by external, visceral and \nskeletal malformations. Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg body weight) tested in \nrats. No teratological or embryo/foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was \nmarked at 0.1 mg/kg due to decreased serum calcium levels.  \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential  \nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma is and what it is used for \n \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma contains the active substance zoledronic acid. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat post-menopausal women and adult men with \nosteoporosis or osteoporosis caused by treatment with corticosteroids used to treat inflammation, and \nPaget\u2019s disease of the bone in adults. \n \nOsteoporosis  \nOsteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in \nwomen after the menopause, but can also occur in men. At the menopause, a woman\u2019s ovaries stop \nproducing the female hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy. Following the menopause \nbone loss occurs, bones become weaker and break more easily. Osteoporosis could also occur in men \nand women because of the long term use of steroids, which can affect the strength of bones. Many \npatients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because \nosteoporosis has made their bones weaker. Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly \noestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men. \nIn both women and men, Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma strengthens the bone and therefore makes it \nless likely to break. Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma is also used in patients who have recently broken \ntheir hip in a minor trauma such as a fall and therefore are at risk of subsequent bone breaks. \n \nPaget\u2019s disease of the bone  \nIt is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. This process is called \nremodelling. In Paget\u2019s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered \nfashion, which makes it weaker than normal. If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed \nand painful, and may break. Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma works by returning the bone remodelling \nprocess to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma \n \nFollow all instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse carefully before you are given \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma. \n \nYou must not be given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n-  if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low).  \n- if you have severe kidney problems. \n-  if you are pregnant.  \n- if you are breast-feeding.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma:  \n-  if you are being treated with any medicine containing zoledronic acid, which is also the active \n\nsubstance of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma (zoledronic acid is used in adult patients with certain \ntypes of cancer to prevent bone complications or to reduce the amount of calcium). \n\n-  if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one.  \n-  if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements.  \n-  if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed.  \n-  if you have had sections of your intestine removed.  \n \nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported in the \npost-marketing setting in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma for osteoporosis. ONJ can \nalso occur after stopping treatment. \n \nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. \nIn order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you \nshould take. \n \nBefore receiving Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma treatment, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if \n- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction; \n- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; \n- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); \n- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders); \n- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) \n- you have cancer. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Zoledronic \nacid Teva Pharma. \n \nWhile being treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma, you should maintain good oral hygiene \n(including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you \nshould make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or are due to undergo dental \nsurgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist \nthat you are being treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. Contact your doctor and dentist \nimmediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or \nswelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nMonitoring test \nYour doctor should do a blood test to check your kidney function (levels of creatinine) before each \ndose of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such \nas water), within a few hours before receiving Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma, as directed by your \nhealthcare provider. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age.

How Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma is given \n \nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse. Check with your doctor or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nOsteoporosis  \nThe usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The infusion \nwill take at least 15 minutes.  \n \nIn case you recently broke your hip, it is recommended that Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma is \nadministered two or more weeks after your hip repair surgery. \n \nIt is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (for example tablets) as directed by your \ndoctor.  \n \nFor osteoporosis, Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma works for one year. Your doctor will let you know \nwhen to return for your next dose.  \n \nPaget\u2019s disease \nFor the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease, Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma should be prescribed only by \nphysicians with experience in the treatment of Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. \n \nThe usual dose is 5 mg, given to you as one initial infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The \ninfusion will take at least 15 minutes. Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma may work for longer than one \nyear, and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again. \n \nYour doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (e.g. tablets) for at least the \nfirst ten days after being given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. It is important that you follow this \nadvice carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after \nthe infusion. Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia.  \n \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma with food and drink \nMake sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma, as directed by your doctor. This will help prevent dehydration. You \nmay eat normally on the day you are treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. This is especially \nimportant in patients who take diuretics (\u201cwater pills\u201d) and in elderly patients (age 65 years or over). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n57 \n\n \nIf you missed a dose of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma  \nContact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment.  \n \nBefore stopping Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma therapy  \nIf you are considering stopping Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma treatment, please go to your next \nappointment and discuss this with your doctor.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects related to the first infusion are very common (occurring in more than 30% of patients) but \nare less common following subsequent infusions. The majority of the side effects, such as fever and \nchills, pain in the muscles or joints, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose \nof Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within \nthree days. Your doctor can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to \nreduce these side effects. The chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent \ndoses of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. \n \nSome side effects could be serious \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nIrregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Teva \nPharma for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether Zoledronic \nacid Teva Pharma causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you \nexperience such symptoms after you have received Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nSwelling, redness, pain and itching to the eyes or eye sensitivity to light. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \nTalk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These could \nbe signs of bone damage in the ear. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \nPain in the mouth, and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness \nor a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth; these could be signs of bone damage in \nthe jaw (osteonecrosis).

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma is and what it is used for \n \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma contains the active substance zoledronic acid. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat post-menopausal women and adult men with \nosteoporosis or osteoporosis caused by treatment with corticosteroids used to treat inflammation, and \nPaget\u2019s disease of the bone in adults. \n \nOsteoporosis  \nOsteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in \nwomen after the menopause, but can also occur in men. At the menopause, a woman\u2019s ovaries stop \nproducing the female hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy. Following the menopause \nbone loss occurs, bones become weaker and break more easily. Osteoporosis could also occur in men \nand women because of the long term use of steroids, which can affect the strength of bones. Many \npatients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because \nosteoporosis has made their bones weaker. Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly \noestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men. \nIn both women and men, Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma strengthens the bone and therefore makes it \nless likely to break. Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma is also used in patients who have recently broken \ntheir hip in a minor trauma such as a fall and therefore are at risk of subsequent bone breaks. \n \nPaget\u2019s disease of the bone  \nIt is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. This process is called \nremodelling. In Paget\u2019s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered \nfashion, which makes it weaker than normal. If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed \nand painful, and may break. Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma works by returning the bone remodelling \nprocess to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma \n \nFollow all instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse carefully before you are given \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma.  \n \nYou must not be given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n63 \n\n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n-  if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low).  \n- if you have severe kidney problems. \n-  if you are pregnant.  \n- if you are breast-feeding.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma:  \n-  if you are being treated with any medicine containing zoledronic acid, which is also the active \n\nsubstance of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma (zoledronic acid is used in adult patients with certain \ntypes of cancer to prevent bone complications or to reduce the amount of calcium). \n\n-  if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one.  \n-  if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements.  \n-  if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed.  \n-  if you have had sections of your intestine removed.  \n \nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported in the \npost-marketing setting in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma for osteoporosis. ONJ can \nalso occur after stopping treatment. \n \nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. \nIn order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you \nshould take. \n \nBefore receiving Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma treatment, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if \n- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction; \n- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; \n- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); \n- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders); \n- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) \n- you have cancer. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Zoledronic \nacid Teva Pharma. \n \nWhile being treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma, you should maintain good oral hygiene \n(including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you \nshould make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or are due to undergo dental \nsurgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist \nthat you are being treated with Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. Contact your doctor and dentist \nimmediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or \nswelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nMonitoring test \nYour doctor should do a blood test to check your kidney function (levels of creatinine) before each \ndose of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such \nas water), within a few hours before receiving Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma, as directed by your \nhealthcare provider. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZoledronic acid Teva Pharma is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age.

acid. it belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat post-menopausal women and adult men with osteoporosis or osteoporosis caused by treatment with corticosteroids used to treat inflammation, and paget's disease of the bone in adults. osteoporosis osteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in women after the menopause, but can also occur in men. at the menopause, a woman's ovaries stop producing the female hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy. following the menopause bone loss occurs, bones become weaker and break more easily. osteoporosis could also occur in men and women because of the long term use of steroids, which can affect the strength of bones. many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because osteoporosis has made their bones weaker. decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly oestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men. in both women and men, zoledronic acid teva pharma strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break. zoledronic acid teva pharma is also used in patients who have recently broken their hip in a minor trauma such as a fall and therefore are at risk of subsequent bone breaks. paget's disease of the bone it is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. this process is called remodelling. in paget's disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered fashion, which makes it weaker than normal. if the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed and painful, and may break. zoledronic acid teva pharma works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zoledronic acid teva pharma", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
