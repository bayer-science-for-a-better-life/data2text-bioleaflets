This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPandemrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nInfluenza vaccine (H1N1)v (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus, inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1) derived strain used NYMC X-179A  3.75 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin  \n \nAS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-Î±-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and \npolysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) \n \nThe suspension and emulsion, once mixed, form a multidose vaccine in a vial.  See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n \nExcipient with known effect  \nThe vaccine contains 5 micrograms thiomersal \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid. \nThe emulsion is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A (H1N1)v 2009 virus. Pandemrix should only be used if the \nrecommended annual seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccines are not available and if \nimmunisation against (H1N1)v is considered necessary (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nPandemrix should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies in \nhealthy subjects  \nSee sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 for details. \n \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nAdults aged 18 years and older: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Pandemrix (H1N1)v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and \nthe second dose. \nSee section 5.1 regarding immune responses to one and two doses of Pandemrix (H1N1)v, including \nantibody levels after 6 and 12 months. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 10-17 years \nDosing may be in accordance with the recommendations for adults.   \n \nChildren aged from 6 months to 9 years \nOne dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date.  \nThere is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval of three \nweeks. \n \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.1. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months \nNo data are available. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Pandemrix should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Pandemrix (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \nFor instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg \nand chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of this \nvaccine. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in subjects with a severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-\nlike strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than \nanaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to thiomersal \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nand to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium \ndeoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nPandemrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nThere are no data with Pandemrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia \nor any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit \noutweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Pandemrix with \nother (H1N1)v vaccines. \n \nEpidemiological studies relating to Pandemrix in several European countries have indicated an increased \nrisk of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated individuals. In \nchildren/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional 1.4 to 8 cases in \n100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 years have indicated \napproximately 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. These data suggest that the excessive \nrisk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination.  \nThe relationship between Pandemrix and narcolepsy is still under investigation. \nPandemrix should only be used if the recommended annual seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza \nvaccines are not available and if immunisation against (H1N1)v is considered necessary (see section 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere are no safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with Pandemrix (H1N1)v in \nchildren aged less than 6 months. Vaccination is not recommended in this age group. \n \nIn children aged 6 to 35 months (N=51) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of the adult dose) with \nan interval of 3 weeks between doses there was an increase in the rates of injection site reactions and \ngeneral symptoms after the second dose (see section 4.8).  In particular rates of fever (axillary \ntemperature â¥38Â°C) increased considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature \nand measures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are \nrecommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) after each dose of Pandemrix. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a \npsychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such \nas transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is \nimportant that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nData obtained on co-administration of Pandemrix (H1N1)v with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza \nvaccine (Fluarix, a split virion vaccine) in healthy adults aged over 60 years did not suggest any \nsignificant interference in the immune response to Pandemrix (H1N1)v. The immune response to Fluarix \nwas satisfactory. \nCo-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to \nadministration of Pandemrix alone.  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTherefore the data indicate that Pandemrix may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs).  \n \nData obtained on the administration of a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, as above) \nthree weeks before a dose of Pandemrix (H1N1)v in healthy adults over 60 years of age, did not suggest \nany significant interference in the immune response to Pandemrix (H1N1)v.  Therefore the data indicate \nthat Pandemrix may be administered three weeks after the administration of non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines. \n \nIn a clinical study where a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, as above) was \nadministered 3 weeks after the second dose of Pandemrix (two doses were given 21 days apart), a lower \nimmune response to Fluarix was observed as compared to subjects who had not previously received \nPandemrix.  It is not known whether the observed effects would apply to administration of non-\nadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine after a single dose of Pandemrix or when longer dose intervals \nhave elapsed since administration of Pandemrix.  It is preferable that non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza \nvaccines should be administered before or with the first dose of Pandemrix. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Pandemrix with other vaccines. \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate \nlimbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results may \nbe due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nPandemrix has been administered to women in each trimester of pregnancy. Information on outcomes \nfrom estimated more than 200,000 women who have been vaccinated during pregnancy is currently \nlimited. There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that \nwere followed in a prospective clinical study. \n \nAnimal studies with Pandemrix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nData from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not \nsuggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPandemrix may be administered in lactating women. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 âUndesirable Effectsâ may affect the ability to drive or \nuse machines. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in more than 1,000 subjects 18 years \nold and above who received Pandemrix (H1N1). \n \nIn adults 18 to 60 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were \ninjection site pain (87.8%), fatigue (32.9%), headache (28.1%), arthralgia (17.9%), myalgia (30.0%), \nshivering (19.4%), injection site swelling (11.5%) and sweating (11.3%). \n \nIn subjects > 60 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were \ninjection site pain (59.0%), myalgia (20.6%), fatigue (17.9%), headache (17.6%) and arthralgia (14.3%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed per dose according to the following frequency: \n

Doses of 15, 5, 1.7 or 0.6 \nmicrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, 7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 \nmicrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment. Control groups included ferrets \nimmunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) or phosphate buffered \nsaline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the intra-tracheal route on \nday 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous H5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of \nthe animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or \nheterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in \nvaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission. In the \nunadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all animals died or had to be \neuthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge. \n \nAdditional information is available from the studies conducted with a vaccine similar in composition to \nPandemrix but containing antigen derived from H5N1 viruses. Please consult the Product Information of \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data obtained with the mock-up vaccine using a H5N1 vaccine strain reveal no special \nhazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose \ntoxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation \nperiod). \n \n \n6.

Chemical and physical in-use stability has been \ndemonstrated for 24 hours at 25Â°C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2Â°C â 8Â°C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after mixing of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nOne pack containing: \n- one pack of 50 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml suspension with a stopper (butyl rubber). \n- two packs of 25 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml emulsion with a stopper (butyl rubber). \n \nThe volume after mixing 1 vial of suspension (2.5 ml) with 1 vial of emulsion (2.5 ml) corresponds to 10 \ndoses of vaccine (5 ml). \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nPandemrix consists of two containers:  \nSuspension: multidose vial containing the antigen,  \nEmulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.  \n \nPrior to administration, the two components should be mixed. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \nInstructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine: \n \n1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nbrought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken and \ninspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the \nevent of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended to \nequip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be available, \na 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained in upside \ndown position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content. \n\n3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other \nvariation being observed, discard the vaccine. \n\n4. The volume of the Pandemrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be administered \nin accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). \n\n5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for \ninjection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle \ngauge not larger than 23-G. \n\n7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2Â°C - 8Â°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25Â°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored \nin a refrigerator, it should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes) before \neach withdrawal. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nPandemrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection \nInfluenza vaccine (H1N1)v (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get any of side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Pandemrix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Pandemrix \n3. How Pandemrix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Pandemrix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pandemrix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Pandemrix is and what it is used for \n \nPandemrix is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus.  \nYour doctor will normally recommend a different vaccine (annual trivalent/quadrivalent influenza \nvaccine) instead of Pandemrix, but if the trivalent/quadrivalent vaccines are not available Pandemrix may \nstill be an option if you need protection against A(H1N1)v influenza (see Take special care with \nPandemrix).  \n \nHow Pandemrix works \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the bodyâs natural defence system) will produce \nits own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Pandemrix \n \nPandemrix should not be given: \n \nâ¢ if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this \n\nvaccine (listed in section 6) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as \nfollows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or \nsodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath \nand swelling of the face or tongue.  \n\nâ¢ if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38Â°C). If this applies to you then your \nvaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse will advise whether you could still be vaccinated \nwith Pandemrix. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Pandemrix: \n \nâ¢ if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any  \n\ningredient contained in this vaccine (listed in section 6), to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, \novalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. . \n\nâ¢ if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few \nweeks after vaccination with Pandemrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor \nrequesting these tests that you have recently been given Pandemrix. \n\nâ¢ if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or \nmay need to be delayed. \n \nExcessive sleepiness during the day, often at the wrong times (a long-term condition called narcolepsy), \nhas been reported very rarely after vaccination with Pandemrix in several European countries. Narcolepsy \ncan occur with or without sudden muscle weakness that can cause falls (a condition called cataplexy). \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nIf your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after the \nsecond dose, especially temperature over 38Â°C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures to \nlower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each dose \nare recommended.  \n \nFainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell \nthe doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nOther medicines and Pandemrix \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or have \nrecently received any other vaccine. \n \nPandemrix can be given at the same time as seasonal influenza vaccines that do not contain an adjuvant.   \n \nPersons who have received a seasonal influenza vaccine that does not contain an adjuvant may receive \nPandemrix after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nThere is  no information on administration of Pandemrix with other vaccines.  However, if this cannot be \navoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.  In such cases, you should be aware that the \nside effects may be more intense.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before you receive this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. âPossible side effectsâ may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \nPandemrix contains thiomersal \nPandemrix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic \nreaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \nPandemrix contains sodium and potassium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 \nmg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n3. How Pandemrix is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \n \nAdults, including the elderly \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nClinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and \nsecond dose. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nChildren from the age of 10 years onwards \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nClinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and \nsecond dose. \n \nChildren from 6 months to 9 years of age \nA dose (0.25 ml) of the vaccine will be given.  \nIf a second dose of 0.25 ml is given this will be administered at least three weeks after the first dose.  \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months of age \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. \n \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n\n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions: \n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock.  Doctors are aware of \nthis possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nOther side effects: \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Pandemrix in clinical studies in adults, including the \nelderly.   \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people  \nâ¢ Headache \nâ¢ Tiredness \nâ¢ Pain and swelling at the injection site \nâ¢ Shivering \nâ¢ Increased sweating \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nâ¢ Aching muscles, joint pain \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \nâ¢ Redness and itching at the injection site \nâ¢ Fever \nâ¢ Feeling sick, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \nâ¢ A hard lump and warmth at the injection site \nâ¢ Swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin \nâ¢ Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet \nâ¢ Sleeplessness \nâ¢ Dizziness \nâ¢ Itching, rash \nâ¢ Generally feeling unwell \nâ¢ Flu-like symptoms \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT YOUR \nDOCTOR. \n \nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents \n \nChildren aged 10-17 years \n \nThe side effects listed above have also been observed with similar frequencies in clinical studies in \nchildren 10 to 17 years of age, except for redness at the injection site which was very common and \nsweating which was common. \n \nChildren aged 3-9 years \n \nIn children 3 to 9 years of age who received two 0.25 ml doses of Pandemrix (H1N1) the side effects \nreported were similar to those reported in adults, except for redness at the injection site and \ngastrointestinal symptoms which were very common and shivering and sweating which were common. In \naddition, fever was very common in children aged 3-5 years. Some side effects (including local redness \nand fever) occurred more frequently after the second dose compared to the first dose. \n \nChildren aged 6-35 months \n \nIn children aged 6-35 months who received two doses of 0.25 ml of Pandemrix (H1N1), there was an \nincrease in reports of pain, redness and swelling at the injection site as well as fever (>38Â°C), drowsiness, \nirritability and loss of appetite after the second dose compared to the first dose.  All these side effects \nwere reported very commonly after each dose. \n \nThe side effects listed below have happened after Pandemrix (H1N1)v came on the market: \n \nâ¢ Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead \n\nto shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in \nsuch cases. \n\nâ¢ Generalised skin reactions including facial swelling and urticaria (hives) \nâ¢ Fits due to fever \nâ¢ A long-term condition with excessive daytime sleepiness (narcolepsy), with or without sudden \n\nweakness (cataplexy), which may lead to falls without loss of consciousness \nâ¢ Short-term sleepiness following vaccination \nâ¢ Reactions at the injection site such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and heat (inflammation), \n\nhard lump (mass) \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given \nroutinely every year to prevent flu.  They may also happen with Pandemrix. \n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \nâ¢ Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves \nâ¢ Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising  \n \nVery rare:  may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people \nâ¢ Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \n\nproblems) \nâ¢ Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), \n\nneuritis (inflammation of nerves) and a type of paralysis known a Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.

Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nbrought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken and \ninspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the \nevent of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended to \nequip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be available, \na 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained in upside \ndown position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content. \n\n3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other \nvariation being observed, discard the vaccine. \n\n4. The volume of the Pandemrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be administered \nin accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 âHow Pandemrix is givenâ). \n\n5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for \ninjection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle \ngauge not larger than 23-G. \n\n7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2Â°C - 8Â°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25Â°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored \nin a refrigerator, it should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes) before \neach withdrawal. \n\n \nThe vaccine should not be administered intravascularly. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tMANUFACTURER OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tOTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\tA.
