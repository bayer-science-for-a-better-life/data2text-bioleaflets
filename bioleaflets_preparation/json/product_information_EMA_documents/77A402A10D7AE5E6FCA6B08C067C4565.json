NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 40 mg telmisartan and 5 mg amlodipine (as amlodipine besilate).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach tablet contains 168.64 mg sorbitol (E420).\nEach tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet\n\nBlue and white oval shaped two layer tablets engraved with the product code A1 and the company logo \non the white layer.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults:\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on \namlodipine 5 mg alone.\n\nReplacement therapy\nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of this medicinal product is one tablet per day.\n\nThe maximum recommended dose is one tablet 80 mg telmisartan/10 mg amlodipine per day. This \nmedicinal product is indicated for long term treatment.\n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5).\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled \nwith amlodipine 5 mg alone.\n\n\n\n3\n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to \nthe fixed combination may be considered.\n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Twynsta 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without \nreducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\n\nReplacement therapy\nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily.\n\nElderly (> 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients.\nNormal amlodipine dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of dosage should take \nplace with care (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is \nadvised when using telmisartan/amlodipine in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not \ndialysable (see also section 4.4).\nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nTwynsta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment telmisartan/amlodipine should be administered with \ncaution. For telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan/amlodipine in children aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nTwynsta can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Twynsta with some liquid.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1\n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock)\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis) \n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction\n\nThe concomitant use of telmisartan/amlodipine with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and \n5.1).\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be \nstopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance.\nThe half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Amlodipine should therefore be initiated at \nthe lower end of the dosing range and caution should be used, both on initial treatment and when \nincreasing the dose. \nTelmisartan/amlodipine should therefore be used with caution in these patients.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\nWhen telmisartan/amlodipine is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of \npotassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the \nadministration of telmisartan/amlodipine in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and \namlodipine are not dialysable.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \ntelmisartan/amlodipine, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an \nintravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been \nstabilised.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute \nrenal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\n\n5\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, \nor obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction\nThere are no data to support the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in unstable angina pectoris and during or \nwithin one month of a myocardial infarction.\n\nPatients with cardiac failure\nIn an amlodipine long-term, placebo controlled study in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class \nIII and IV) the reported incidence of pulmonary oedema was higher in the amlodipine treated group than \nin the placebo group (see section 5.1). Therefore, patients with heart failure should be treated with \ncaution.\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with congestive \nheart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics \nmay be required when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic \npatients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium \nlevels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events. \n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years)\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the \n\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or \ntherapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes \ncontaining potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective \nCOX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma).\n\nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5).\n\nElderly patients\nThe increase of the amlodipine dosage should take place with care in the elderly patients (see section 4.2\nand 5.2).\n\n\n\n6\n\nOther\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or \nstroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies. \n\nInteractions linked to the combination\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive medicinal products \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan/amlodipine can be increased by concomitant use of \nother antihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including this medicinal product, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by \nalcohol.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\nInteractions linked to telmisartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n\nOther antihypertensive agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n7\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and medicinal \nproducts that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including \npossible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be \nadministered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and \nperiodically thereafter.\n\nRamipril\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nDigoxin\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49 %) and in trough concentration (20 %) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range.\n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure resulting in an increased risk of hypotension. The clinical \ntranslation of these PK variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose \nadjustment may thus be required.\n\nCYP3A4 inducers\nUpon co-administration of known inducers of the CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine\nmay vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and dose regulation considered both\nduring and after concomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.\nrifampicin, hypericum perforatum).\n\nDantrolene (infusion)\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \nhyperkalemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalemia, \nit is recommended that the coadministration of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided \nin patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice\nAdministration of Twynsta with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended since bioavailability \nmay be increased in certain patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects.  \n\n\n\n8\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nTacrolimus\nThere is a risk of increased tacrolimus blood levels when co-administered with amlodipine but the \npharmacokinetic mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. In order to avoid toxicity of \ntacrolimus, administration of amlodipine in a patient treated with tacrolimus requires monitoring of \ntacrolimus blood levels and dose adjustment of tacrolimus when appropriate.\n\nCyclosporine\nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted with cyclosporine and amlodipine in healthy volunteers \nor other populations with the exception of renal transplant patients, where variable trough concentration \nincreases (average 0% - 40%) of cyclosporine were observed. Consideration should be given for \nmonitoring cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients on amlodipine, and cyclosporine dose \nreductions should be made as necessary.\n\nMechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors\nmTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are CYP3A substrates. Amlodipine is a \nweak CYP3A inhibitor. With concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors, amlodipine may increase exposure of \nmTOR inhibitors.\n\nSimvastatin\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an \nincrease in exposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of \nsimvastatin in patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are limited data from the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in pregnant women. Animal reproductive \ntoxicity studies with telmisartan/amlodipine have not been performed.\n\nTelmisartan\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy \n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot \nbe excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be \nstopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n9\n\nAmlodipine\n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established.\nIn animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has \nbeen estimated with an interquartile range of 3 – 7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of amlodipine \non infants is unknown.\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan during breast-feeding, \ntelmisartan/amlodipine is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm \ninfant.\n\nFertility\nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the fixed dose combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available.\nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not been \nconducted.\n\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed.\n\nIn some patients treated by calcium channel blockers, reversible biochemical changes in the head of \nspermatozoa have been reported. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThis medicinal product has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \nbe advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo \nduring treatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or \nusing machines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema. Serious syncope may \noccur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients).\n\nAdverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (telmisartan or amlodipine) \nmay be potential adverse reactions with Twynsta as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during \nthe post-marketing period.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety and tolerability of Twynsta has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with over \n3,500 patients, over 2,500 of whom received telmisartan in combination with amlodipine.\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n10\n\nSystem Organ\nClass\n\nTwynsta Telmisartan Amlodipine\n\nInfections and infestations\nUncommon upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection including \npharyngitis and\nsinusitis, urinary tract \ninfection including \ncystitis\n\nRare cystitis sepsis including fatal \noutcome1\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nUncommon anaemia\n\nRare thrombocytopenia, \neosinophilia \n\nVery rare leukocytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare hypersensitivity, \n\nanaphylactic reaction\n\nVery rare hypersensitivity\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon hyperkalaemia\n\nRare hypoglycaemia (in \ndiabetic patients)\n\nVery rare hyperglycaemia\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nUncommon mood change\n\nRare depression,\nanxiety,\ninsomnia\n\nconfusion\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon dizziness\n\nUncommon somnolence,\nmigraine,\nheadache,\nparaesthesia\n\nRare syncope,\nperipheral neuropathy,\nhypoaesthesia,\ndysgeusia,\ntremor\n\n\n\n11\n\nVery rare extrapyramidal \nsyndrome,\nhypertonia\n\nEye disorders \nCommon visual disturbance \n\n(including diplopia)\nUncommon visual impairment\n\nRare visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nUncommon vertigo tinnitus\n\nCardiac disorders\nUncommon bradycardia,\n\npalpitations\n\nRare tachycardia\n\nVery rare myocardial infarction, \narrhythmia, \nventricular \ntachycardia, atrial \nfibrillation\n\nVascular disorders\nUncommon hypotension,\n\northostatic\nhypotension, flushing\n\nVery rare vasculitis\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nUncommon cough dyspnoea dyspnoea, rhinitis\n\nVery rare interstitial lung disease3\n\nGastrointestinal disorder\nCommon altered bowel habits \n\n(including diarrhoea \nand constipation)\n\nUncommon abdominal pain,\ndiarrhoea,\nnausea\n\nflatulence\n\nRare vomiting,\ngingival hypertrophy,\ndyspepsia,\ndry mouth\n\nstomach discomfort\n\nVery rare pancreatitis, gastritis\n\nHepato-biliary disorders\n\n\n\n12\n\nRare hepatic function \nabnormal, liver \ndisorder2\n\nVery rare hepatitis, jaundice, \nhepatic enzyme \nelevations (mostly \nconsistent with \ncholestasis)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon pruritus hyperhidrosis alopecia, purpura, skin \n\ndiscolouration, \nhyperhidrosis\n\nRare eczema, erythema,\nrash\n\nangioedema (with fatal \noutcome), \ndrug eruption, \ntoxic skin eruption, \nurticaria\n\nVery rare angioedema, \nerythema multiforme, \nurticaria, \nexfoliative dermatitis, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nphotosensitivity\n\nNot known toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon ankle swelling\n\nUncommon arthralgia,\nmuscle spasms\n(cramps in legs),\nmyalgia\n\nRare back pain,\npain in extremity (leg\npain)\n\ntendon pain (tendinitis \nlike symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUncommon renal impairment \n\nincluding acute renal \nfailure\n\nmicturition disorder, \npollakiuria\n\nRare nocturia\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon erectile dysfunction gynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site condition\n\n\n\n13\n\nCommon peripheral oedema\n\nUncommon asthenia,\nchest pain, fatigue,\noedema\n\npain\n\nRare malaise influenza-like illness\n\nInvestigations\nUncommon hepatic enzymes\n\nincreased\nblood creatinine \nincreased\n\nweight increased, \nweight decreased\n\nRare blood uric acid\nincreased\n\nblood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased, \nhaemoglobin decreased\n\n1: the event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known\n2: most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience with \ntelmisartan occurred in Japanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse \nreactions.\n3: cases of interstitial lung disease (predominantly interstitial pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia) \nhave been reported from post-marketing experience with telmisartan\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V*.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of overdose are expected to be in line with exaggerated pharmacological effects. \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been \nreported.\nOverdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex \ntachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal \noutcome have been reported.\n\nTreatment\nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures \ninclude induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of\noverdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine. \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted.\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours \nafter administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine.\nTelmisartan and Amlodipine are not removed by haemodialysis.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04.\n\nTwynsta combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \npressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a \ndihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine.\nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \ngreater degree than either component alone.\nTwynsta once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.  \n\nTelmisartan\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. \nTelmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT \nreceptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible \noverstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels \nare decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. \nTelmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also \ndegrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.\n\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough \nto peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo \ncontrolled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of \nbaseline systolic blood pressure. In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure are inconsistent. \n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to \nthat of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in \nclinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination \nwith Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in \n\n\n\n15\n\nDiabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor \nblocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared \nto monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also \nrelevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was \na study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse \noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group \nthan in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \nplacebo group.\n\nAmlodipine\nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular \nsmooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant \neffect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood \npressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-\ndihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with a greater effect on vascular \nsmooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow onset \nof action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration.\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.\n\nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids and is \nsuitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout.\n\nUse in patients with heart failure\nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology.\n\nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart failure \nreceiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an increase in \nrisk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure.\n\nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with \nNYHA III and IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of underlying \nischaemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine had no effect on \ntotal cardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated with increased reports \nof pulmonary oedema.\n\n\n\n16\n\nTelmisartan/Amlodipine\nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Twynsta resulted in significantly greater diastolic \nand systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective monotherapy \ncomponents.\n\nTwynsta showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic dose \nrange of 21.8/16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), 22.1/18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), 24.7/20.2 mmHg \n(40 mg/10 mg) and 26.4/20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure \n<90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. Values are adjusted \nfor baseline and country.\n\nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy.\nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 - 51.8 %\nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean changes \nin systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(22.2/17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; 22.5/19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (21.0/17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period.\n\nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of 1097 \npatients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both amlodipine \nmonotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (13.6/9.4 mmHg, \n15.0/10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus 6.2/5.7 mmHg, 11.1/8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus 42 %, 56.7 %\nwith amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with 40 mg/5 mg and \n\n80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4 % versus 24.9 %, respectively).\n\nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (11.1/9.2 mmHg, 11.3/ 9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 7.4/6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Twynsta was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients not \nadequately controlled with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-titration \nto Twynsta 80 mg/10 mg.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Twynsta in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions \nwere peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported were in \nagreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and amlodipine. \nNo new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events (peripheral oedema, \n\n\n\n17\n\ngeneralised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who received Twynsta as compared \nto patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial the oedema rates were 1.3 % with \nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 %\nwith Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on amlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for amlodipine 10 mg.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect of Twynsta was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes.\n\nTwynsta has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Twynsta\nin all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Twynsta are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 %\n(40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate. \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-\nlife of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations \nwere higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\n\n\n18\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance \n(Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min).\n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous \nadministration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of amlodipine metabolites are \nexcreted in urine. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years)\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients.\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. In \nelderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and elimination \nhalf-life.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not changed \nin patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of \namlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60 % in AUC.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of telmisartan \nand amlodipine were tested.\n\nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below.\n\nTelmisartan\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \n\n\n\n19\n\nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In both species, \nincreased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were \nobserved. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening \nwas observed.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\nAmlodipine\n\nReproductive toxicology\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour \nand decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended \ndosage for humans based on mg/kg.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and \nfemales for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 8 times* the \nmaximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day on an mg/m2 basis). \nIn another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose \ncomparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and \ntestosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids \nand Sertoli cells.\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide \ndaily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest \ndose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a \nmg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.\n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTwynsta 40 mg/10 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 40 mg telmisartan and 10 mg amlodipine (as amlodipine besilate).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach tablet contains 168.64 mg sorbitol (E420).\nEach tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet\n\nBlue and white oval shaped two layer tablets engraved with the product code A2 and the company logo \non the white layer.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults:\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 40 mg/10 mg is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on \namlodipine 10 mg alone.\n\nReplacement therapy\nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of this medicinal productis one tablet per day.\n\nThe maximum recommended dose is one tablet 80 mg telmisartan/10 mg amlodipine per day. This \nmedicinal product is indicated for long term treatment.\n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5).\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 40 mg/10 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled \nwith amlodipine 10 mg alone.\n\n\n\n22\n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to \nthe fixed combination may be considered.\n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Twynsta 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without \nreducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\n\nReplacement therapy\nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily. \n\nElderly (> 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients.\nNormal amlodipine dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of dosage should take \nplace with care (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is \nadvised when using telmisartan/amlodipine in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not \ndialysable (see also section 4.4).\nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nTwynsta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment telmisartan/amlodipine should be administered with \ncaution. For telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan/amlodipine in children aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nTwynsta can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Twynsta with some liquid.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1\n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock)\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis) \n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction\n\nThe concomitant use of telmisartan/amlodipine with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and \n5.1).\n\n\n\n23\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be \nstopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. \nThe half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Amlodipine should therefore be initiated at \nthe lower end of the dosing range and caution should be used, both on initial treatment and when \nincreasing the dose. \nTelmisartan/amlodipine should therefore be used with caution in these patients.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\nWhen telmisartan/amlodipine is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of \npotassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the \nadministration of telmisartan/amlodipine in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and \namlodipine are not dialysable.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs \nwithtelmisartan/amlodipine, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given \nan intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been \nstabilised.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute \nrenal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\n\n24\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, \nor obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction\nThere are no data to support the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in unstable angina pectoris and during or \nwithin one month of a myocardial infarction.\n\nPatients with cardiac failure\nIn an amlodipine long-term, placebo controlled study in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class \nIII and IV) the reported incidence of pulmonary oedema was higher in the amlodipine treated group than \nin the placebo group (see section 5.1). Therefore, patients with heart failure should be treated with \ncaution.\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with congestive \nheart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics \nmay be required when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic \npatients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium \nlevels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events. \n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years)\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the \n\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or \ntherapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes \ncontaining potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective \nCOX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma).\n\nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5).\n\nElderly patients\nThe increase of the amlodipine dosage should take place with care in the elderly patients (see section 4.2\nand 5.2).\n\n\n\n25\n\nOther\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or \nstroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies. \n\nInteractions linked to the combination\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive medicinal products \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan/amlodipine can be increased by concomitant use of \nother antihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including this medicinal product, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by \nalcohol.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\nInteractions linked to telmisartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n\nOther antihypertensive agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n26\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and medicinal \nproducts that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including \npossible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be \nadministered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and \nperiodically thereafter.\n\nRamipril\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nDigoxin\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49 %) and in trough concentration (20 %) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range.\n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure resulting in an increased risk of hypotension. The clinical \ntranslation of these PK variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose \nadjustment may thus be required.\n\nCYP3A4 inducers\nUpon co-administration of known inducers of the CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine\nmay vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and dose regulation considered both\nduring and after concomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.\nrifampicin, hypericum perforatum).\n\nDantrolene (infusion)\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \nhyperkalemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalemia, \nit is recommended that the coadministration of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided \nin patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice\nAdministration of Twynsta with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended since bioavailability \nmay be increased in certain patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects.  \n\n\n\n27\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nTacrolimus\nThere is a risk of increased tacrolimus blood levels when co-administered with amlodipine but the \npharmacokinetic mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. In order to avoid toxicity of \ntacrolimus, administration of amlodipine in a patient treated with tacrolimus requires monitoring of \ntacrolimus blood levels and dose adjustment of tacrolimus when appropriate.\n\nCyclosporine\nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted with cyclosporine and amlodipine in healthy volunteers \nor other populations with the exception of renal transplant patients, where variable trough concentration \nincreases (average 0% - 40%) of cyclosporine were observed. Consideration should be given for \nmonitoring cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients on amlodipine, and cyclosporine dose \nreductions should be made as necessary.\n\nMechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors\nmTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are CYP3A substrates. Amlodipine is a \nweak CYP3A inhibitor. With concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors, amlodipine may increase exposure of \nmTOR inhibitors.\n\nSimvastatin\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an \nincrease in exposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of \nsimvastatin in patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are limited data from the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in pregnant women. Animal reproductive \ntoxicity studies with telmisartan/amlodipine have not been performed.\n\nTelmisartan\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy \n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot \nbe excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n28\n\nAmlodipine\n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established.\nIn animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has \nbeen estimated with an interquartile range of 3 – 7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of amlodipine \non infants is unknown.\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan during breast-feeding, \ntelmisartan/amlodipine is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm \ninfant.\n\nFertility\nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the fixed dose combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available.\n\nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not been \nconducted.\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed.\n\nIn some patients treated by calcium channel blockers, reversible biochemical changes in the head of \nspermatozoa have been reported. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThis medicinal product has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \nbe advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo \nduring treatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or \nusing machines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema. Serious syncope may \noccur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients).\n\nAdverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (telmisartan or amlodipine) \nmay be potential adverse reactions with Twynsta as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during \nthe post-marketing period.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety and tolerability of Twynsta has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with over \n3,500 patients, over 2,500 of whom received telmisartan in combination with amlodipine.\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n29\n\nSystem Organ\nClass\n\nTwynsta Telmisartan Amlodipine\n\nInfections and infestations\nUncommon upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection including \npharyngitis and\nsinusitis, urinary tract \ninfection including \ncystitis\n\nRare cystitis sepsis including fatal \noutcome1\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nUncommon anaemia\n\nRare thrombocytopenia, \neosinophilia \n\nVery rare leukocytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare hypersensitivity, \n\nanaphylactic reaction\n\nVery rare hypersensitivity\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon hyperkalaemia\n\nRare hypoglycaemia (in \ndiabetic patients)\n\nVery rare hyperglycaemia\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nUncommon mood change\n\nRare depression,\nanxiety,\ninsomnia\n\nconfusion\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon dizziness\n\nUncommon somnolence,\nmigraine,\nheadache,\nparaesthesia\n\nRare syncope,\nperipheral neuropathy,\nhypoaesthesia,\ndysgeusia,\ntremor\n\n\n\n30\n\nVery rare extrapyramidal \nsyndrome,\nhypertonia\n\nEye disorders \nCommon visual disturbance \n\n(including diplopia)\nUncommon visual impairment\n\nRare visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nUncommon vertigo tinnitus\n\nCardiac disorders\nUncommon bradycardia,\n\npalpitations\n\nRare tachycardia\n\nVery rare myocardial infarction, \narrhythmia, \nventricular \ntachycardia, atrial \nfibrillation\n\nVascular disorders\nUncommon hypotension,\n\northostatic\nhypotension, flushing\n\nVery rare vasculitis\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nUncommon cough dyspnoea dyspnoea, rhinitis\n\nVery rare interstitial lung disease3\n\nGastrointestinal disorder\nCommon altered bowel habits \n\n(including diarrhoea \nand constipation)\n\nUncommon abdominal pain,\ndiarrhoea,\nnausea\n\nflatulence\n\nRare vomiting,\ngingival hypertrophy,\ndyspepsia,\ndry mouth\n\nstomach discomfort\n\nVery rare pancreatitis, gastritis\n\nHepato-biliary disorders\n\n\n\n31\n\nRare hepatic function \nabnormal, liver \ndisorder2\n\nVery rare hepatitis, jaundice, \nhepatic enzyme \nelevations (mostly \nconsistent with \ncholestasis)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon pruritus hyperhidrosis alopecia, purpura, skin \n\ndiscolouration, \nhyperhidrosis\n\nRare eczema, erythema,\nrash\n\nangioedema (with fatal \noutcome), \ndrug eruption, \ntoxic skin eruption, \nurticaria\n\nVery rare angioedema, \nerythema multiforme, \nurticaria, \nexfoliative dermatitis, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nphotosensitivity\n\nNot known toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon ankle swelling\n\nUncommon arthralgia,\nmuscle spasms\n(cramps in legs),\nmyalgia\n\nRare back pain,\npain in extremity (leg\npain)\n\ntendon pain (tendinitis \nlike symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUncommon renal impairment \n\nincluding acute renal \nfailure\n\nmicturition disorder, \npollakiuria\n\nRare nocturia\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon erectile dysfunction gynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site condition\nCommon peripheral oedema\n\n\n\n32\n\nUncommon asthenia,\nchest pain, fatigue,\noedema\n\npain\n\nRare malaise influenza-like illness\n\nInvestigations\nUncommon hepatic enzymes\n\nincreased\nblood creatinine \nincreased\n\nweight increased, \nweight decreased\n\nRare blood uric acid\nincreased\n\nblood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased, \nhaemoglobin decreased\n\n1: the event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known\n2: most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience with \ntelmisartan occurred in Japanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse \nreactions.\n3: cases of interstitial lung disease (predominantly interstitial pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia) \nhave been reported from post-marketing experience with telmisartan\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V*.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of overdose are expected to be in line with exaggerated pharmacological effects. \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been \nreported.\nOverdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex \ntachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal \noutcome have been reported.\n\nTreatment\nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures \ninclude induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of\noverdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine. \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. \nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours \nafter administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine.\nTelmisartan and Amlodipine are not removed by haemodialysis.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n33\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04.\n\nTwynsta combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \npressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a \ndihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine.\nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \ngreater degree than either component alone.\nTwynsta once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.  \n\nTelmisartan\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. \nTelmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT \nreceptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible \noverstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels \nare decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. \nTelmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also \ndegrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.\n\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough \nto peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo \ncontrolled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of \nbaseline systolic blood pressure. In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure are inconsistent. \n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to \nthat of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in \nclinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination \nwith Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in \n\n\n\n34\n\nDiabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor \nblocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared \nto monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also \nrelevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was \na study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse\noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group \nthan in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \nplacebo group.\n\nAmlodipine\nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular \nsmooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant \neffect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood \npressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-\ndihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with a greater effect on vascular \nsmooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow onset \nof action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration.\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.\n\nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids and is \nsuitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout.\n\nUse in patients with heart failure\nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology.\n\nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart failure \nreceiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an increase in \nrisk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure.\n\nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III \nand IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of underlying ischaemic \ndisease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine had no effect on total \ncardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema.\n\n\n\n35\n\nTelmisartan/Amlodipine\nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Twynsta resulted in significantly greater diastolic \nand systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective monotherapy \ncomponents.\n\nTwynsta showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic dose \nrange of 21.8/16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), 22.1/18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), 24.7/20.2 mmHg \n(40 mg/10 mg) and 26.4/20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure \n<90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. Values are adjusted \nfor baseline and country.\n\nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy.\nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 – 51.8 %\nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean changes \nin systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(22.2/17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; 22.5/19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (21.0/17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period.\n\nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of 1097\npatients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both amlodipine \nmonotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (13.6/9.4 mmHg, \n15.0/10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus 6.2/5.7 mmHg, 11.1/8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus 42-%, 56.7 %\nwith amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with 40 mg/5 mg and \n80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4 % versus 24.9 %, respectively).\n\nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (11.1/9.2 mmHg, 11.3/ 9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 7.4/6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Twynsta was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients not \nadequately controlled with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-titration \nto Twynsta 80 mg/10 mg.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Twynsta in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions \nwere peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported were in \nagreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and amlodipine. \nNo new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events (peripheral oedema, \n\n\n\n36\n\ngeneralised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who received Twynsta as compared \nto patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial the oedema rates were 1.3 % with \nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 %\nwith Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on amlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for amlodipine 10 mg.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect of Twynsta was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes.\n\nTwynsta has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Twynsta\nin all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Twynsta are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 %\n(40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate. \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-\nlife of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations \nwere higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\n\n\n37\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance \n(Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min).\n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous \nadministration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of amlodipine metabolites are \nexcreted in urine. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years)\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients.\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. In \nelderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and elimination \nhalf-life.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not changed \nin patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of \namlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60 % in AUC.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of telmisartan \nand amlodipine were tested.\n\nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below.\n\nTelmisartan\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \n\n\n\n38\n\nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In both species, \nincreased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were \nobserved. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening \nwas observed.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\nAmlodipine\n\nReproductive toxicology\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour \nand decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended \ndosage for humans based on mg/kg.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and \nfemales for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 8 times* the \nmaximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day on an mg/m2 basis). \nIn another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose \ncomparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and \ntestosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids \nand Sertoli cells.\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide \ndaily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest \ndose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a \nmg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.\n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg\n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 80 mg telmisartan and 5 mg amlodipine (as amlodipine besilate).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach tablet contains 337.28 mg sorbitol (E420).\nEach tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet\n\nBlue and white oval shaped two layer tablets engraved with the product code A3 and the company logo \non the white layer.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults:\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 80 mg/5 mg is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with \nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg .\n\nReplacement therapy\nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of this medicinal product is one tablet per day.\n\nThe maximum recommended dose is one tablet 80 mg telmisartan/10 mg amlodipine per day. This \nmedicinal product is indicated for long term treatment.\n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5).\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 80 mg/5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled \nwith Twynsta 40 mg/5 mg.\n\n\n\n41\n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to \nthe fixed combination may be considered.\n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Twynsta 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without \nreducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\n\nReplacement therapy\nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily. \n\nElderly (> 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients.\nNormal amlodipine dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of dosage should take \nplace with care (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is \nadvised when using telmisartan/amlodipine in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not \ndialysable (see also section 4.4).\nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nTwynsta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment telmisartan/amlodipine should be administered with \ncaution. For telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan/amlodipine in children aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nTwynsta can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Twynsta with some liquid.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1\n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock)\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis) \n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction\n\nThe concomitant use of telmisartan/amlodipine with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and \n5.1).\n\n\n\n42\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be \nstopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. \nThe half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Amlodipine should therefore be initiated at \nthe lower end of the dosing range and caution should be used, both on initial treatment and when \nincreasing the dose. \nTelmisartan/amlodipine should therefore be used with caution in these patients.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\nWhen telmisartan/amlodipine is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of \npotassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the \nadministration of telmisartan/amlodipine in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and \namlodipine are not dialysable.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \ntelmisartan/amlodipine, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an \nintravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been \nstabilised.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute \nrenal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\n\n43\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, \nor obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction\nThere are no data to support the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in unstable angina pectoris and during or \nwithin one month of a myocardial infarction.\n\nPatients with cardiac failure\nIn an amlodipine long-term, placebo controlled study in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class \nIII and IV) the reported incidence of pulmonary oedema was higher in the amlodipine treated group than \nin the placebo group (see section 5.1). Therefore, patients with heart failure should be treated with \ncaution.\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with congestive \nheart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics \nmay be required when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic \npatients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium \nlevels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events. \n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years)\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the \n\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or \ntherapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes \ncontaining potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective \nCOX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma).\n\nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5).\n\nElderly patients\nThe increase of the amlodipine dosage should take place with care in the elderly patients (see section 4.2\nand 5.2).\n\nSorbitol\nThis medicine contains 337.28 mg sorbitol in each tablet. \nSorbitol is a source of fructose. Twynsta is not recommended for use in patients with hereditary fructose \nintolerance (HFI).\n\n\n\n44\n\nOther\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or \nstroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies. \n\nInteractions linked to the combination\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive medicinal products \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan/amlodipine can be increased by concomitant use of \nother antihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including this medicinal product, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by \nalcohol.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\nInteractions linked to telmisartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n\nOther antihypertensive agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n45\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and medicinal \nproducts that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including \npossible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be \nadministered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and \nperiodically thereafter.\n\nRamipril\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nDigoxin\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49 %) and in trough concentration (20 %) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range.\n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure resulting in an increased risk of hypotension. The clinical \ntranslation of these PK variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose \nadjustment may thus be required.\n\nCYP3A4 inducers\nUpon co-administration of known inducers of the CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine\nmay vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and dose regulation considered both\nduring and after concomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.\nrifampicin, hypericum perforatum).\n\nDantrolene (infusion)\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \nhyperkalemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalemia, \nit is recommended that the coadministration of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided \nin patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice\nAdministration of Twynsta with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended since bioavailability \nmay be increased in certain patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects.  \n\n\n\n46\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nTacrolimus\nThere is a risk of increased tacrolimus blood levels when co-administered with amlodipine but the \npharmacokinetic mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. In order to avoid toxicity of \ntacrolimus, administration of amlodipine in a patient treated with tacrolimus requires monitoring of \ntacrolimus blood levels and dose adjustment of tacrolimus when appropriate.\n\nCyclosporine\nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted with cyclosporine and amlodipine in healthy volunteers \nor other populations with the exception of renal transplant patients, where variable trough concentration \nincreases (average 0% - 40%) of cyclosporine were observed. Consideration should be given for \nmonitoring cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients on amlodipine, and cyclosporine dose \nreductions should be made as necessary.\n\nMechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors\nmTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are CYP3A substrates. Amlodipine is a \nweak CYP3A inhibitor. With concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors, amlodipine may increase exposure of \nmTOR inhibitors.\n\nSimvastatin\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an \nincrease in exposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of \nsimvastatin in patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are limited data from the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in pregnant women. Animal reproductive \ntoxicity studies with telmisartan/amlodipine have not been performed.\n\nTelmisartan\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy\n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot \nbe excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n47\n\nAmlodipine\n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established.\nIn animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has \nbeen estimated with an interquartile range of 3 – 7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of amlodipine \non infants is unknown.\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan during breast-feeding, \ntelmisartan/amlodipine is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm \ninfant.\n\nFertility\nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the fixed dose combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available.\n\nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not been \nconducted.\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed.\nIn some patients treated by calcium channel blockers, reversible biochemical changes in the head of \nspermatozoa have been reported. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThis medicinal product has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \nbe advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo \nduring treatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or \nusing machines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema. Serious syncope may \noccur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients).\n\nAdverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (telmisartan or amlodipine) \nmay be potential adverse reactions with Twynsta as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during \nthe post-marketing period.\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety and tolerability of Twynsta has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with over \n3,500 patients, over 2,500 of whom received telmisartan in combination with amlodipine.\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n48\n\nSystem Organ\nClass\n\nTwynsta Telmisartan Amlodipine\n\nInfections and infestations\nUncommon upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection including \npharyngitis and\nsinusitis, urinary tract \ninfection including \ncystitis\n\nRare cystitis sepsis including fatal \noutcome1\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nUncommon anaemia\n\nRare thrombocytopenia, \neosinophilia \n\nVery rare leukocytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare hypersensitivity, \n\nanaphylactic reaction\n\nVery rare hypersensitivity\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon hyperkalaemia\n\nRare hypoglycaemia (in \ndiabetic patients)\n\nVery rare hyperglycaemia\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nUncommon mood change\n\nRare depression,\nanxiety,\ninsomnia\n\nconfusion\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon dizziness\n\nUncommon somnolence,\nmigraine,\nheadache,\nparaesthesia\n\nRare syncope,\nperipheral neuropathy,\nhypoaesthesia,\ndysgeusia,\ntremor\n\n\n\n49\n\nVery rare extrapyramidal \nsyndrome,\nhypertonia\n\nEye disorders \nCommon visual disturbance \n\n(including diplopia)\nUncommon visual impairment\n\nRare visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nUncommon vertigo tinnitus\n\nCardiac disorders\nUncommon bradycardia,\n\npalpitations\n\nRare tachycardia\n\nVery rare myocardial infarction, \narrhythmia, \nventricular tachycardia, \natrial fibrillation\n\nVascular disorders\nUncommon hypotension,\n\northostatic\nhypotension, flushing\n\nVery rare vasculitis\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nUncommon cough dyspnoea dyspnoea, rhinitis\n\nVery rare interstitial lung disease3\n\nGastrointestinal disorder\nCommon altered bowel habits \n\n(including diarrhoea \nand constipation)\n\nUncommon abdominal pain,\ndiarrhoea,\nnausea\n\nflatulence\n\nRare vomiting,\ngingival hypertrophy,\ndyspepsia,\ndry mouth\n\nstomach discomfort\n\nVery rare pancreatitis, gastritis\n\nHepato-biliary disorders\n\n\n\n50\n\nRare hepatic function \nabnormal, liver \ndisorder2\n\nVery rare hepatitis, jaundice, \nhepatic enzyme \nelevations (mostly \nconsistent with \ncholestasis)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon pruritus hyperhidrosis alopecia, purpura, skin \n\ndiscolouration, \nhyperhidrosis\n\nRare eczema, erythema,\nrash\n\nangioedema (with fatal \noutcome), \ndrug eruption, \ntoxic skin eruption, \nurticaria\n\nVery rare angioedema, \nerythema multiforme, \nurticaria, \nexfoliative dermatitis, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nphotosensitivity\n\nNot known toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon ankle swelling\n\nUncommon arthralgia,\nmuscle spasms\n(cramps in legs),\nmyalgia\n\nRare back pain,\npain in extremity (leg\npain)\n\ntendon pain (tendinitis \nlike symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUncommon renal impairment \n\nincluding acute renal \nfailure\n\nmicturition disorder, \npollakiuria\n\nRare nocturia\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon erectile dysfunction gynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site condition\n\n\n\n51\n\nCommon peripheral oedema\n\nUncommon asthenia,\nchest pain, fatigue,\noedema\n\npain\n\nRare malaise influenza-like illness\n\nInvestigations\nUncommon hepatic enzymes\n\nincreased\nblood creatinine \nincreased\n\nweight increased, \nweight decreased\n\nRare blood uric acid\nincreased\n\nblood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased, haemoglobin \ndecreased\n\n1: the event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known\n2: most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience with \ntelmisartan occurred in Japanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse \nreactions.\n3: cases of interstitial lung disease (predominantly interstitial pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia) \nhave been reported from post-marketing experience with telmisartan\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V*.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of overdose are expected to be in line with exaggerated pharmacological effects. \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been \nreported.\nOverdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex \ntachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal \noutcome have been reported.\n\nTreatment\nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures \ninclude induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of \noverdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine. \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. \nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours \nafter administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine.\nTelmisartan and Amlodipine are not removed by haemodialysis.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n52\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04.\n\nTwynsta combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \npressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a \ndihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine.\nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \ngreater degree than either component alone.\nTwynsta once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.  \n\nTelmisartan\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. \nTelmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT \nreceptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible \noverstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels \nare decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. \nTelmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also \ndegrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.\n\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough \nto peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo \ncontrolled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of \nbaseline systolic blood pressure. In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure are inconsistent. \n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to \nthat of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in \nclinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination \nwith Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in \n\n\n\n53\n\nDiabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor \nblocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared \nto monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also \nrelevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was \na study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse \noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group \nthan in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \nplacebo group.\n\nAmlodipine\nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular \nsmooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant \neffect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood \npressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-\ndihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with a greater effect on vascular \nsmooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow onset \nof action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration.\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.\n\nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids and is \nsuitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout.\n\nUse in patients with heart failure\nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology.\n\nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart failure \nreceiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an increase in \nrisk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure.\n\nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III \nand IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of underlying ischaemic \ndisease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine had no effect on total \ncardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema.\n\n\n\n54\n\nTelmisartan/Amlodipine\nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Twynsta resulted in significantly greater diastolic \nand systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective monotherapy \ncomponents.\n\nTwynsta showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic dose \nrange of 21.8/16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), 22.1/18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), 24.7/20.2 mmHg \n(40 mg/10 mg) and 26.4/20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure \n<90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. Values are adjusted \nfor baseline and country.\n\nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy.\nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7-51.8 %\nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean changes \nin systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(22.2/17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; 22.5/19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (21.0/17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period.\n\nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of 1097 \npatients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both amlodipine \nmonotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (13.6/9.4 mmHg, \n15.0/10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus 6.2/5.7 mmHg, 11.1/8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus 42 %, 56.7 %\nwith amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with 40 mg/5 mg and \n80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4 % versus 24.9 %, respectively).\n\nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (11.1/9.2 mmHg, 11.3/ 9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 7.4/6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Twynsta was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients not \nadequately controlled with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-titration \nto Twynsta 80 mg/10 mg.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Twynsta in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions \nwere peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported were in \nagreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and amlodipine. \nNo new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events (peripheral oedema, \n\n\n\n55\n\ngeneralised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who received Twynsta as compared \nto patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial the oedema rates were 1.3 % with \nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 %\nwith Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on amlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for amlodipine 10 mg.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect of Twynsta was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes.\n\nTwynsta has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Twynsta\nin all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Twynsta are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 %\n(40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate. \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-\nlife of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations \nwere higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\n\n\n56\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance \n(Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min).\n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous \nadministration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of amlodipine metabolites are \nexcreted in urine. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years)\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients.\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. In \nelderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and elimination \nhalf-life.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not changed \nin patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of \namlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60 % in AUC.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of telmisartan \nand amlodipine were tested.\n\nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below.\n\nTelmisartan\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \n\n\n\n57\n\nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In both species, \nincreased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were \nobserved. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening \nwas observed.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\nAmlodipine\n\nReproductive toxicology\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour \nand decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended \ndosage for humans based on mg/kg.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and \nfemales for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 8 times* the \nmaximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day on an mg/m2 basis). \nIn another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose \ncomparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and \ntestosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids \nand Sertoli cells.\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide \ndaily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest \ndose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a \nmg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.\n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTwynsta 80 mg/10 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 80 mg telmisartan and 10 mg amlodipine (as amlodipine besilate).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach tablet contains 337.28 mg sorbitol (E420).\nEach tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet\n\nBlue and white oval shaped two layer tablets engraved with the product code A4 and the company logo \non the white layer.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults:\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 80 mg/10 mg is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on on \nTwynsta 40 mg/10 mg or Twynsta 80 mg/5 mg.\n\nReplacement therapy\nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of this medicinal product is one tablet per day.\n\nThe maximum recommended dose is one tablet 80 mg telmisartan/10 mg amlodipine per day. This \nmedicinal product is indicated for long term treatment.\n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5).\n\nAdd on therapy\nTwynsta 80 mg/10 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled \non Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg or Twynsta 80 mg/5 mg.\n\n\n\n60\n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to \nthe fixed combination may be considered.\n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Twynsta 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without \nreducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\n\nReplacement therapy\nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nTwynsta containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily. .\n\nElderly (> 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients.\nNormal amlodipine dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of dosage should take \nplace with care (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is \nadvised when using telmisartan/amlodipine in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not \ndialysable (see also section 4.4).\nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nTwynsta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment telmisartan/amlodipine should be administered with \ncaution. For telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of telmisartan/amlodipine in children aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nTwynsta can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Twynsta with some liquid.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1\n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock)\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis) \n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction\n\nThe concomitant use of telmisartan/amlodipine with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5, and \n5.1).\n\n\n\n61\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPregnancy\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be \nstopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance.\nThe half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Amlodipine should therefore be initiated at \nthe lower end of the dosing range and caution should be used, both on initial treatment and when \nincreasing the dose.\nTelmisartan/amlodipine should therefore be used with caution in these patients.\n\nRenovascular hypertension\nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation\nWhen telmisartan/amlodipine is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of \npotassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the \nadministration of telmisartan/amlodipine in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and \namlodipine are not dialysable.\n\nIntravascular hypovolaemia\nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \ntelmisartan/amlodipine, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an \nintravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been \nstabilised.\n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute \nrenal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II \nreceptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy.\n\nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\n\n62\n\nPrimary aldosteronism\nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended.\n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, \nor obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction\nThere are no data to support the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in unstable angina pectoris and during or \nwithin one month of a myocardial infarction.\n\nPatients with cardiac failure\nIn an amlodipine long-term, placebo controlled study in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class \nIII and IV) the reported incidence of pulmonary oedema was higher in the amlodipine treated group than \nin the placebo group (see section 5.1). Therefore, patients with heart failure should be treated with \ncaution.\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with congestive \nheart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality.\n\nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics\nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics \nmay be required when indicated.\n\nHyperkalaemia\nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic \npatients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium \nlevels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events,. \n\nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.\nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:\n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years)\n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the \n\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or \ntherapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes \ncontaining potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective \nCOX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.\n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma).\n\nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5).\n\nElderly patients\nThe increase of the amlodipine dosage should take place with care in the elderly patients (see section 4.2\nand 5.2).\n\nSorbitol\nThis medicine contains 337.28 mg sorbitol in each tablet. \nSorbitol is a source of fructose. Twynsta is not recommended for use in patients with hereditary fructose \nintolerance (HFI).\n\n\n\n63\n\nOther\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or \nstroke.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies. \n\nInteractions linked to the combination\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed.\n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive medicinal products \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan/amlodipine can be increased by concomitant use of \nother antihypertensive medicinal products.\n\nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential\nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including this medicinal product, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by \nalcohol.\n\nCorticosteroids (systemic route)\nReduction of the antihypertensive effect.\n\nInteractions linked to telmisartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\n\nLithium\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n\nOther antihypertensive agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n64\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products\nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with\ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and medicinal \nproducts that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including \npossible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be \nadministered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and \nperiodically thereafter.\n\nRamipril\nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nDigoxin\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49 %) and in trough concentration (20 %) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range.\n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine\n\nConcomitant use requiring caution\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure resulting in an increased risk of hypotension. The clinical \ntranslation of these PK variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose \nadjustment may thus be required.\n\nCYP3A4 inducers\nUpon co-administration of known inducers of the CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine\nmay vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and dose regulation considered both\nduring and after concomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.\nrifampicin, hypericum perforatum).\n\nDantrolene (infusion)\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \nhyperkalemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalemia, \nit is recommended that the coadministration of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided \nin patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice\nAdministration of Twynsta with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended since bioavailability \nmay be increased in certain patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects.  \n\n\n\n65\n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account\n\nTacrolimus\nThere is a risk of increased tacrolimus blood levels when co-administered with amlodipine but the \npharmacokinetic mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. In order to avoid toxicity of \ntacrolimus, administration of amlodipine in a patient treated with tacrolimus requires monitoring of \ntacrolimus blood levels and dose adjustment of tacrolimus when appropriate.\n\nCyclosporine\nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted with cyclosporine and amlodipine in healthy volunteers \nor other populations with the exception of renal transplant patients, where variable trough concentration \nincreases (average 0% - 40%) of cyclosporine were observed. Consideration should be given for \nmonitoring cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients on amlodipine, and cyclosporine dose \nreductions should be made as necessary.\n\nMechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors\nmTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are CYP3A substrates. Amlodipine is a \nweak CYP3A inhibitor. With concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors, amlodipine may increase exposure of \nmTOR inhibitors.\n\nSimvastatin\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an \nincrease in exposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of \nsimvastatin in patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are limited data from the use of telmisartan/amlodipine in pregnant women. Animal reproductive \ntoxicity studies with telmisartan/amlodipine have not been performed.\n\nTelmisartan\n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy \n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot \nbe excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\n\nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).\nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n66\n\nAmlodipine\n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established.\nIn animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has \nbeen estimated with an interquartile range of 3 – 7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of amlodipine \non infants is unknown.\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan during breast-feeding, \ntelmisartan/amlodipine is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm \ninfant.\n\nFertility\nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the fixed dose combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available.\n\nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not been \nconducted.\nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed.\nIn some patients treated by calcium channel blockers, reversible biochemical changes in the head of \nspermatozoa have been reported. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThis medicinal product has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \nbe advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo \nduring treatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or \nusing machines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema. Serious syncope may \noccur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients).\n\nAdverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (telmisartan or amlodipine) \nmay be potential adverse reactions with Twynsta as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during \nthe post-marketing period.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety and tolerability of Twynsta has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with over \n3,500 patients, over 2,500 of whom received telmisartan in combination with amlodipine.\n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n67\n\nSystem Organ\nClass\n\nTwynsta Telmisartan Amlodipine\n\nInfections and infestations\nUncommon upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection including \npharyngitis and\nsinusitis, urinary tract \ninfection including \ncystitis\n\nRare cystitis sepsis including fatal \noutcome1\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nUncommon anaemia\n\nRare thrombocytopenia, \neosinophilia \n\nVery rare leukocytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare hypersensitivity, \n\nanaphylactic reaction\n\nVery rare hypersensitivity\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon hyperkalaemia\n\nRare hypoglycaemia (in \ndiabetic patients)\n\nVery rare hyperglycaemia\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nUncommon mood change\n\nRare depression,\nanxiety,\ninsomnia\n\nconfusion\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon dizziness\n\nUncommon somnolence,\nmigraine,\nheadache,\nparaesthesia\n\nRare syncope,\nperipheral neuropathy,\nhypoaesthesia,\ndysgeusia,\ntremor\n\n\n\n68\n\nVery rare extrapyramidal \nsyndrome,\nhypertonia\n\nEye disorders \nCommon visual disturbance \n\n(including diplopia)\nUncommon visual impairment\n\nRare visual disturbance\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nUncommon vertigo tinnitus\n\nCardiac disorders\nUncommon bradycardia,\n\npalpitations\n\nRare tachycardia\n\nVery rare myocardial infarction, \narrhythmia, \nventricular tachycardia, \natrial fibrillation\n\nVascular disorders\nUncommon hypotension,\n\northostatic\nhypotension, flushing\n\nVery rare vasculitis\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nUncommon cough dyspnoea dyspnoea, rhinitis\n\nVery rare interstitial lung disease3\n\nGastrointestinal disorder\nCommon altered bowel habits \n\n(including diarrhoea \nand constipation)\n\nUncommon abdominal pain,\ndiarrhoea,\nnausea\n\nflatulence\n\nRare vomiting,\ngingival hypertrophy,\ndyspepsia,\ndry mouth\n\nstomach discomfort\n\nVery rare pancreatitis, gastritis\n\nHepato-biliary disorders\n\n\n\n69\n\nRare hepatic function \nabnormal, liver \ndisorder2\n\nVery rare hepatitis, jaundice, \nhepatic enzyme \nelevations (mostly \nconsistent with \ncholestasis)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon pruritus hyperhidrosis alopecia, purpura, skin \n\ndiscolouration, \nhyperhidrosis\n\nRare eczema, erythema,\nrash\n\nangioedema (with fatal \noutcome), \ndrug eruption, \ntoxic skin eruption, \nurticaria\n\nVery rare angioedema, \nerythema multiforme, \nurticaria, \nexfoliative dermatitis, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \nphotosensitivity\n\nNot known toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon ankle swelling\n\nUncommon arthralgia,\nmuscle spasms\n(cramps in legs),\nmyalgia\n\nRare back pain,\npain in extremity (leg\npain)\n\ntendon pain (tendinitis \nlike symptoms)\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUncommon renal impairment \n\nincluding acute renal \nfailure\n\nmicturition disorder, \npollakiuria\n\nRare nocturia\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon erectile dysfunction gynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site condition\n\n\n\n70\n\nCommon peripheral oedema\n\nUncommon asthenia,\nchest pain, fatigue,\noedema\n\npain\n\nRare malaise influenza-like illness\nInvestigations\nUncommon hepatic enzymes\n\nincreased\nblood creatinine \nincreased\n\nweight increased, \nweight decreased\n\nRare blood uric acid\nincreased\n\nblood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased, haemoglobin \ndecreased\n\n1: the event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known\n2: most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience with \ntelmisartan occurred in Japanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse \nreactions.\n3: cases of interstitial lung disease (predominantly interstitial pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia) \nhave been reported from post-marketing experience with telmisartan\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V*.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of overdose are expected to be in line with exaggerated pharmacological effects. \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and \ntachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been \nreported.\nOverdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex \ntachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal \noutcome have been reported.\n\nTreatment\nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures \ninclude induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of\noverdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine. \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. \nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours \nafter administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine.\nTelmisartan and Amlodipine are not removed by haemodialysis.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n71\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04.\n\nTwynsta combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \npressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a \ndihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine.\nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \ngreater degree than either component alone.\nTwynsta once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.  \n\nTelmisartan\nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist \nactivity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. \nTelmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised \nAT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible \noverstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels \nare decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. \nTelmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also \ndegrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.\n\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough \nto peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo \ncontrolled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of \nbaseline systolic blood pressure. In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure are inconsistent. \n\nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product’s diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to \nthat of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in \nclinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and \nlisinopril).\n\nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n\nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments.\n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination \nwith Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in \n\n\n\n72\n\nDiabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor \nblocker.\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared \nto monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also \nrelevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy.\n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was \na study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse \noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group \nthan in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \nplacebo group.\n\nAmlodipine\nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular \nsmooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant \neffect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood \npressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-\ndihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with a greater effect on vascular \nsmooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow onset \nof action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration.\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.\n\nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids and is \nsuitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout.\n\nUse in patients with heart failure\nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology.\n\nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart failure \nreceiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an increase in \nrisk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure.\n\nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III \nand IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of underlying ischaemic \ndisease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine had no effect on total \ncardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema.\n\n\n\n73\n\nTelmisartan/Amlodipine\nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Twynsta resulted in significantly greater diastolic \nand systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective monotherapy \ncomponents.\n\nTwynsta showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic dose \nrange of 21.8/16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), 22.1/18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), 24.7/20.2 mmHg \n(40 mg/10 mg) and 26.4/20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure \n<90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. Values are adjusted \nfor baseline and country.\n\nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy.\nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 – 51.8 %\nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean changes \nin systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(22.2/17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; 22.5/19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (21.0/17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period.\n\nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of 1097 \npatients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both amlodipine \nmonotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (13.6/9.4 mmHg, \n15.0/10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus 6.2/5.7 mmHg, 11.1/8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus 42 %, 56.7 %\nwith amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with 40 mg/5 mg and \n80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4 % versus 24.9 %, respectively).\n\nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg \nreceived Twynsta (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks of \ntreatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (11.1/9.2 mmHg, 11.3/ 9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 7.4/6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg).\n\nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Twynsta was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients not \nadequately controlled with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-titration \nto Twynsta 80 mg/10 mg.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Twynsta in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions \nwere peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported were in \nagreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and amlodipine. \nNo new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events (peripheral oedema, \n\n\n\n74\n\ngeneralised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who received Twynsta as compared \nto patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial the oedema rates were 1.3 % with \nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Twynsta 40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 %\nwith Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on amlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for amlodipine 10 mg.\n\nThe antihypertensive effect of Twynsta was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes.\n\nTwynsta has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Twynsta\nin all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Twynsta are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 %\n(40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion.\n\nDistribution\nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.\n\nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.\n\nBiotransformation\nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate. \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites.\n\nElimination\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under \nthe plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence \nof clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations \nwere higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.\n\n\n\n75\n\nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance \n(Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min).\n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous \nadministration for 7–8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of amlodipine metabolites are \nexcreted in urine. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.\n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years)\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.\n\nGender\nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients.\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. In \nelderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and elimination \nhalf-life.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not changed \nin patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of \namlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60 % in AUC.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of telmisartan \nand amlodipine were tested.\n\nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below.\n\nTelmisartan\nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \n\n\n\n76\n\nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In both species, \nincreased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were \nobserved. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.\nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening \nwas observed.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.\n\nAmlodipine\n\nReproductive toxicology\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour \nand decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended \ndosage for humans based on mg/kg.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and \nfemales for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 8 times* the \nmaximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day on an mg/m2 basis). \nIn another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose \ncomparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and \ntestosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids \nand Sertoli cells.\n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide \ndaily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest \ndose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a \nmg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.\n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n115\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\nTwynsta 40 mg/5 mg tablets\n\nTelmisartan/Amlodipine\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n3. How to take Twynsta\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Twynsta\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n\nTwynsta tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure:\n Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”.\n\nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.\n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops\ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening.\n\nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels tightening. \nAs a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.\n\nTwynsta is used to treat high blood pressure\n in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine alone.\n in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who\n\nwish to take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually \nno symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure \nblood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n\nDo not take Twynsta\n if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker).\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Twynsta in early pregnancy – see \n\nPregnancy section.)\n\n\n\n116\n\n if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder).\n\n if you have narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack.\n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Twynsta.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the \nfollowing conditions or illnesses:\n Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis).\n Liver disease.\n Heart trouble.\n Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance \n\nof various blood minerals).\n Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n Diabetes.\n Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis).\n Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris).\n A heart attack within the last four weeks.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta:\n if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems.\n- aliskiren.\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also “Do not take Twynsta”.\n\n if you are elderly and your dose needs to be increased.\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Twynsta.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nTwynsta is not recommended in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years. \n\nOther medicines and Twynsta\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some \ncases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \nbelow:\n Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’).\n Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\n ACE-inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take Twynsta” and \n\n“Warnings and precautions”).\n\n\n\n117\n\n NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim.\n\n Rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin (antibiotics).\n St. John’s wort.\n Dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities).\n Medicines used to alter the way your immune system works (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus and \n\neverolimus).\n Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole).\n Diltiazem (cardiac medicine).\n Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol.\n Digoxin.\n\nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Twynsta may be reduced when you take \nNSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids.\n\nTwynsta may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, neuroleptics \nor antidepressants).\n\nTwynsta with food and drink\nLow blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up.\n\nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Twynsta. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine in \nsome patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Twynsta.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor \nwill normally advise you to stop taking Twynsta before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Twynsta. Twynsta is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts.\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Twynsta is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to \nbreast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of spinning \n(vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, do not drive \nor use machines.\n\nTwynsta contains sorbitol \nThis medicine contains 168.64 mg sorbitol in each tablet.\n\nTwynsta contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.\n\n\n\n118\n\n3. How to take Twynsta\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.\nRemove your Twynsta tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake.\n\nYou can take Twynsta with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or \none 40 mg/10 mg tablet per day.\n\nIf you take more Twynsta than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. Slow \nheart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged low blood \npressure including shock and death have also been reported.\n\nIf you forget to take Twynsta\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you stop taking Twynsta\nIt is important that you take Twynsta every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Twynsta is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n3. How to take Twynsta\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Twynsta\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n\nTwynsta tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure:\n Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.\n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening.\n\nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels tightening. \nAs a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.\n\nTwynsta is used to treat high blood pressure\n in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine alone.\n in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who \n\nwish to take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually \nno symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure \nblood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n\nDo not take Twynsta\n if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker).\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Twynsta in early pregnancy – see \n\nPregnancy section.)\n\n\n\n125\n\n if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder).\n\n if you have narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack.\n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Twynsta.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the \nfollowing conditions or illnesses:\n Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis).\n Liver disease.\n Heart trouble.\n Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance \n\nof various blood minerals).\n Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n Diabetes.\n Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis).\n Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris).\n A heart attack within the last four weeks.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta:\n if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems.\n- aliskiren.\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also “Do not take Twynsta”.\n\n if you are elderly and your dose needs to be increased.\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Twynsta. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nTwynsta is not recommended in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years. \n\nOther medicines and Twynsta\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some \ncases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \nbelow:\n Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’).\n Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\n ACE-inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take Twynsta” and \n\n“Warnings and precautions”).\n\n\n\n126\n\n NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim.\n\n Rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin (antibiotics).\n St. John’s wort.\n Dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities).\n Medicines used to alter the way your immune system works (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus and \n\neverolimus).\n Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole).\n Diltiazem (cardiac medicine).\n Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol.\n Digoxin.\n\nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Twynsta may be reduced when you take \nNSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids.\n\nTwynsta may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, neuroleptics \nor antidepressants).\n\nTwynsta with food and drink\nLow blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up.\n\nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Twynsta. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine in \nsome patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Twynsta.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor \nwill normally advise you to stop taking Twynsta before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Twynsta. Twynsta is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts.\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Twynsta is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to \nbreast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of spinning \n(vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, do not drive \nor use machines.\n\nTwynsta contains sorbitol \nThis medicine contains 168.64 mg sorbitol in each tablet.\n\nTwynsta contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.\n\n\n\n127\n\n3. How to take Twynsta\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.\nRemove your Twynsta tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake.\n\nYou can take Twynsta with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or one 40 \nmg/10 mg tablet per day.\n\nIf you take more Twynsta than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. Slow \nheart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged low blood \npressure including shock and death have also been reported.\n\nIf you forget to take Twynsta\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you stop taking Twynsta\nIt is important that you take Twynsta every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Twynsta is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n3. How to take Twynsta\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Twynsta\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n\nTwynsta tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure:\n Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.\n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening.\n\nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels tightening. \nAs a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.\n\nTwynsta is used to treat high blood pressure\n in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine alone.\n in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who \n\nwish to take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually \nno symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure \nblood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n\nDo not take Twynsta\n if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker).\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Twynsta in early pregnancy – see \n\nPregnancy section.)\n\n\n\n134\n\n if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder).\n\n if you have narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack.\n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Twynsta.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the \nfollowing conditions or illnesses:\n Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis).\n Liver disease.\n Heart trouble.\n Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance \n\nof various blood minerals).\n Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n Diabetes.\n Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis).\n Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris).\n A heart attack within the last four weeks.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta:\n if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems.\n- aliskiren.\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also “Do not take Twynsta”.\n\n if you are elderly and your dose needs to be increased.\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Twynsta. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nTwynsta is not recommended in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years. \n\nOther medicines and Twynsta\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some \ncases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \nbelow:\n Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’).\n Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\n ACE-inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take Twynsta” and \n\n“Warnings and precautions”).\n\n\n\n135\n\n NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim.\n\n Rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin (antibiotics)\n St. John’s wort.\n Dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities).\n Medicines used to alter the way your immune system works (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus and \n\neverolimus).\n Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole).\n Diltiazem (cardiac medicine).\n Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol.\n Digoxin.\n\nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Twynsta may be reduced when you take \nNSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids.\n\nTwynsta may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, neuroleptics \nor antidepressants).\n\nTwynsta with food and drink\nLow blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up.\n\nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Twynsta. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine in \nsome patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Twynsta.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor \nwill normally advise you to stop taking Twynsta before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Twynsta. Twynsta is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts.\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Twynsta is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to \nbreast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of spinning \n(vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, do not drive \nor use machines.\n\nTwynsta contains sorbitol \nThis medicine contains 337.28 mg sorbitol in each tablet.\n\nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you have an intolerance to some sugars or \nif you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a \nperson cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you take or receive this medicine.\n\n\n\n136\n\nTwynsta contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.\n\n3. How to take Twynsta\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.\nRemove your Twynsta tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake.\n\nYou can take Twynsta with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or \none 40 mg/10 mg tablet per day.\n\nIf you take more Twynsta than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. Slow \nheart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged low blood \npressure including shock and death have also been reported.\n\nIf you forget to take Twynsta\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you stop taking Twynsta\nIt is important that you take Twynsta every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Twynsta is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n3. How to take Twynsta\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Twynsta\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Twynsta is and what it is used for\n\nTwynsta tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure:\n Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \n\nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.\n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening.\n\nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels tightening. \nAs a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.\n\nTwynsta is used to treat high blood pressure\n in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine alone.\n in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who \n\nwish to take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience.\n\nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually \nno symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure \nblood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Twynsta\n\nDo not take Twynsta\n if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker).\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Twynsta in early pregnancy – see \n\nPregnancy section.)\n\n\n\n143\n\n if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder).\n\n if you have narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack.\n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Twynsta.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the \nfollowing conditions or illnesses:\n Kidney disease or kidney transplant.\n Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis).\n Liver disease.\n Heart trouble.\n Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance \n\nof various blood minerals).\n Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or \nvomiting.\n\n Elevated potassium levels in your blood.\n Diabetes.\n Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis).\n Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris).\n A heart attack within the last four weeks.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Twynsta:\n if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:\n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems.\n- aliskiren.\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also “Do not take Twynsta”.\n\n if you are elderly and your dose needs to be increased.\n\nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Twynsta. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nTwynsta is not recommended in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years. \n\nOther medicines and Twynsta\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some \ncases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \nbelow:\n Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression.\n Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’).\n Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\n ACE-inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take Twynsta” and \n\n“Warnings and precautions”).\n\n\n\n144\n\n NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim.\n\n Rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin (antibiotics).\n St. John’s wort.\n Dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities).\n Medicines used to alter the way your immune system works (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus and \n\neverolimus).\n Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole).\n Diltiazem (cardiac medicine).\n Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol.\n Digoxin.\n\nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Twynsta may be reduced when you take \nNSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids.\n\nTwynsta may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, neuroleptics \nor antidepressants).\n\nTwynsta with food and drink\nLow blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up.\n\nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Twynsta. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine in \nsome patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Twynsta.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nPregnancy\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor \nwill normally advise you to stop taking Twynsta before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Twynsta. Twynsta is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAmlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts.\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Twynsta is not recommended \nfor mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to \nbreast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of spinning \n(vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, do not drive \nor use machines.\n\nTwynsta contains sorbitol \nThis medicine contains 337.28 mg sorbitol in each tablet.\n\nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you have an intolerance to some sugars or \nif you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a \nperson cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you take or receive this medicine.\n\n\n\n145\n\nTwynsta contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.\n\n3. How to take Twynsta\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.\nRemove your Twynsta tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake.\n\nYou can take Twynsta with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink.\n\nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or \none 40 mg/10 mg tablet per day.\n\nIf you take more Twynsta than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. Slow \nheart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged low blood \npressure including shock and death have also been reported.\n\nIf you forget to take Twynsta\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor forgotten individual doses.\n\nIf you stop taking Twynsta\nIt is important that you take Twynsta every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Twynsta is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.
