This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFexeric 1 g film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 1 g of ferric citrate coordination complex (equivalent to 210 mg of \nferric iron).  \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach film-coated tablet contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) (0.99 mg) and Allura Red AC (E129) \n(0.70 mg). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nPeach-coloured, oval shaped, film-coated tablet, embossed with “KX52”. Tablets are 19 mm long, \n7.2 mm thick and 10 mm wide. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFexeric is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney \ndisease (CKD). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nStarting dose \n \nThe recommended starting dose of Fexeric is 3 to 6 g (3 to 6 tablets) per day based on serum \nphosphorus levels.   \n \nCKD patients who are not on dialysis require the lower starting dose, 3 g (3 tablets) per day.  \n \nFexeric must be taken in divided doses with or immediately after meals of the day.  \n \nPatients previously on other phosphate binders who are switched to Fexeric should start taking 3 to 6 g \n(3 to 6 tablets) per day. \n \nPatients receiving this medicine should adhere to their prescribed low phosphate diets. \n \nDose titration \n \nSerum phosphorus concentrations should be monitored within 2 to 4 weeks of starting or changing the \ndose of Fexeric, and approximately every 2-3 months when stable. The dose can be increased or \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\ndecreased by 1 to 2 g (1 to 2 tablets) per day at 2- to 4-week intervals as needed to maintain serum \nphosphorus at recommended target levels up to a maximum of 12 g (12 tablets) per day. \n \nThere are limited data available for doses higher than 9 g (9 tablets) per day in CKD patients not on \ndialysis; therefore in this population doses higher than 9 g/day should be used with caution. \n \nTemporarily discontinue Fexeric if the serum phosphorus is < 3 mg/dl and resume at a lower dose \nonce the serum phosphorus has returned to the target range. \n \nTreatment with Fexeric may lead to elevations in iron stores, particularly in patients receiving \nconcomitant intravenous iron therapy. Fexeric should be temporarily discontinued if serum ferritin \nexceeds 800 ng/ml (see section 4.4).  \n \nLong term safety data are limited in non-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients (see section \n5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Fexeric in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly population \n \nFexeric has been administered to over 400 patients ≥ 65 years of age in studies where the dose was \ntitrated to achieve target serum phosphorus levels. The elderly patients were treated according to the \nrecommended dosing regimen without any safety concerns. Experience from clinical studies in \npatients above the age of 75 years is limited. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nExperience from clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. No dosage reduction is \nconsidered necessary but patients with hepatic impairment should initiate treatment with the lower \nstarting dose, 3 g (3 tablets) per day (see section 5.1).  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. Tablets should be taken whole.  \nPatients must take Fexeric with or immediately after meals. The total daily dose should be divided \nacross the meals of the day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Hypophosphataemia  \n Active severe gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding) \n Haemochromatosis or laboratory tests indicating possible haemochromatosis  \n Other iron overload (primary or secondary) syndromes  \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring iron parameters \n \nIncreases in ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are observed with Fexeric use. This medicine \nshould be used only in the absence of iron overload syndromes and with caution if serum ferritin rises \nabove 500 ng/ml. Fexeric should be temporarily discontinued if serum ferritin exceeds 800 ng/ml. \nSignificantly elevated ferritin levels were observed particularly when concomitant intravenous iron \nwas used.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nAll patients receiving this medicine require at least quarterly monitoring of serum iron storage \nparameters (serum ferritin and TSAT). Serum ferritin and TSAT levels increase after intravenous iron \nadministration; hence, blood samples for measurement of iron storage parameters should be obtained \nat a time appropriate to reflect the patient’s iron status after intravenous iron dosing taking into \naccount the product used, the amount of iron given and the frequency of dosing, but a minimum of \n7 days after intravenous iron dosing.  \n \nPatients treated with Fexeric should not receive concomitant treatment with other oral iron \npreparations.  \n \nReductions in intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) use with this medicine \nhave been observed. Therefore, patients may need reduction in, or discontinuation of, intravenous iron \nand/or ESAs.  \n \nInflammatory bowel disease \n \nPatients with active, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease were excluded from clinical trials. \nFexeric should only be used in these patients following careful assessment of benefit/risk. \n \nGeneral \n \nEach 1 g film-coated tablet contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) (0.99 mg) and Allura Red AC (E129) \n(0.70 mg) which may cause allergic reaction.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on Fexeric \n \nResults from subgroup analyses in the pivotal clinical study in dialysis patients show that the \nconcomitant use of frequently co-prescribed medications in CKD patients (fluoroquinolones, \ntetracyclines, proton pump inhibitors, thyroid hormones, sertraline, Vitamin D, warfarin, \nacetylsalicylic acid) do not affect the efficacy of Fexeric with respect to its ability to lower serum \nphosphorus.  \n \nEffects of Fexeric on other medicinal products \n \nSince citrate is known to increase aluminium absorption, aluminium-based compounds should be \navoided while patients receive Fexeric. \n \nTreatment with Fexeric may lead to elevations in iron stores, particularly in patients receiving \nconcomitant intravenous iron therapy. Patients with elevated ferritin levels receiving intravenous iron \nmay require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of intravenous iron therapy.  \n \nReductions in ESA use with Fexeric have been observed. Therefore, patients may need a reduction in \nthe dose of ESAs. \n \nIn drug-drug interaction studies in healthy male and female subjects, Fexeric decreased the \nbioavailability of concomitantly administered ciprofloxacin (as measured by the area under the curve \n[AUC]) by approximately 45%. However, there was no interaction when Fexeric and ciprofloxacin \nwere taken 2 hours apart. Consequently, ciprofloxacin should not be taken at the same time, but at \nleast 2 hours before or after Fexeric. Fexeric did not alter the bioavailability of the following \nmedicinal products when concomitantly administered: clopidogrel, digoxin, diltiazem, glimepiride, \nlosartan. \n \nFrom in vitro studies, certain antibiotic (doxycycline, cefdinir), anticonvulsant (valproate sodium), \nantidepressant (sertraline HCl), bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium), anti-parkinsonian (levodopa) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nand immunosuppressant (methotrexate) medications showed the potential to interact with Fexeric: any \nof these or other medicinal products that have the potential to interact with Fexeric, should be taken at \nleast 2 hours before or after Fexeric. \n \nSince iron-based preparations are known to reduce the absorption of levothyroxine (thyroxine), \nphysicians should consider monitoring suitable markers or clinical signs of efficacy if these medicinal \nproducts are concomitantly administered with Fexeric.  \n \nAlthough the potential for interactions with medicinal products seems low, for concomitant treatment \nwith products with a narrow therapeutic window, the clinical effect/adverse events should be \nmonitored on initiation or dose adjustment of Fexeric or the concomitant product. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and women of childbearing potential \n \nThere are no data regarding the use of ferric citrate coordination complex in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Fexeric is not \nrecommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraceptive \nmethods. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether ferric citrate coordination complex/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A \nrisk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fexeric therapy taking into account the benefit of breast \nfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo data are available on the potential influence of Fexeric on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFexeric has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD \n5D) patients during treatment were discoloured faeces and diarrhoea occurring in 18% and 13% of \npatients, respectively. These adverse reactions are characteristic of iron-containing medicinal products \nand abated with time with continued dosing. All serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal in \nnature (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, gastritis, gastritis erosive, and haematemesis). These \nserious adverse reactions were uncommon (less than 1 case of each per 100 patients) and were each \nreported in 0.2% (1/557) of CKD 5D patients who received Fexeric.  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in non-dialysis dependent CKD (CKD ND) patients \nduring treatment were discoloured faeces, constipation and diarrhoea occurring in 27%, 13% and 11% \nof patients, respectively. None of the reported serious events in Study 204 were considered to be \npossibly related to Fexeric. In the remaining non-dialysis studies, a total of 3 serious adverse reactions \nreported in 2 patients were gastrointestinal in nature (gastrointestinal ulcer, gastric polyps and colonic \npolyps).  \n \nIncreases in ferritin and TSAT above safety thresholds are observed with Fexeric use. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of Fexeric for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia has been investigated in 18 clinical \ntrials involving a total of 1388 CKD 5D patients with treatment duration of up to 2 years and 145 \nCKD ND patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks to 1 year. \n \nIn CKD 5D patients, the primary evaluation of safety is based on the integrated analysis of data from 4 \nstudies involving 557 CKD 5D patients treated with Fexeric for up to 1 year. In CKD ND patients, the \nprimary evaluation of safety is based on data from the pivotal study (Study 204), where 75 patients \nwere treated with Fexeric for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported in CKD 5D and CKD ND patients \nare presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Frequencies of adverse reactions are defined using the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 1:  Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies in which Fexeric was administered \n\nin CKD 5D patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n\nSystem organ class by MedDRA Adverse Reaction \nInfections and Infestations  \nUncommon: Bronchitis \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \nUncommon: Decreased appetite, hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypophosphataemia, increased appetite \nNervous system disorders  \nUncommon: Dizziness, headache \nCardiac disorders  \nUncommon: Palpitations, dyspnoea \nVascular disorders  \nUncommon: Malignant hypertension \nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n \n\nUncommon: Pulmonary oedema, wheezing \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nVery common: Diarrhoea, discoloured faeces \nCommon:  Abdominal pain/discomfort/distension, \n\nconstipation, nausea, vomiting \nUncommon:  Abnormal faeces, bowel movement irregularity, \n\ndry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, \nfrequent bowel movements, gastritis, gastritis \nerosive, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, \nhaematemesis, peptic ulcer \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \nUncommon: Pruritus, rash \nRenal and urinary disorders  \nUncommon: Incontinence \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n \n\nUncommon: Pain, thirst \nInvestigations  \nUncommon: Abnormal breath sounds, increased serum ferritin, \n\nincreased transferrin saturation, increased weight \nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural \nComplications \n\n \n\nUncommon: Muscle injury \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 2:  Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies in which Fexeric was administered \nin CKD ND patients.  \n\nSystem Organ Class by MedDRA Adverse Reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \nCommon: Hypophosphataemia \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nVery common: Diarrhoea, constipation, discoloured faeces  \nCommon:  abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\nhaemorrhoids, haematochezia, mucous stools, \ndyspepsia, flatulence, dry mouth \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo data are available regarding overdose of Fexeric in humans. In patients with CKD, the maximum \ndose studied was 12 g (12 tablets) of Fexeric per day.  \n \nIron overdose is dangerous, particularly in children, and requires immediate attention. The symptoms \nof acute iron overdose include vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, irritability, and drowsiness. If \nsomeone is known or suspected to have accidentally or intentionally ingested an overdose of Fexeric, \nimmediate medical attention should be sought. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia \nATC code: V03AE08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThis medicine contains ferric citrate coordination complex as the active substance. The iron \ncomponent reacts with dietary phosphate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and precipitates phosphate as \nferric phosphate. This compound is insoluble and is excreted in the stool, reducing the amount of \nphosphate that is absorbed from the GI tract. By binding phosphate in the GI tract and decreasing \nabsorption, Fexeric lowers the levels of serum phosphorus.  Following absorption, citrate is converted \ninto bicarbonate by the tissues.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe ability of Fexeric to control serum phosphorus in CKD patients was principally evaluated in one \nlong-term, pivotal Phase III trial (Study 304) in CKD 5D patients, and in one pivotal Phase II, 12 \nweek, placebo-controlled trial (Study 204) in CKD ND patients with anaemia. Both studies were \nperformed in North American and/or Asian patients.  \nAs a secondary endpoint in dialysis patients, and a co-primary endpoint in non-dialysis patients, the \nability of Fexeric to increase iron stores was also evaluated.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nEffects on phosphorus homeostasis \n \nIn the pivotal dialysis study 304, following a 2-week washout period, 441 CKD 5D patients with \nhyperphosphatemia were randomised to receive Fexeric (n=292) or active control (sevelamer \ncarbonate and/or calcium acetate; n=149) open-label for 52 weeks. The starting dose of Fexeric was \n6 tablets/day (6 g/day), in divided doses with meals. The starting dose of active control was the \npatient's dose prior to the washout period. \n \nThe dose of phosphate binder was titrated as needed to maintain serum phosphorus levels between 3.5 \nand 5.5 mg/dl, to a maximum of 12 g/day. Non-inferiority to sevelamer carbonate was determined at \nWeek 12. Following completion of the 52-week active-controlled period, patients were eligible to \nenter a 4-week placebo-controlled period in which they were re-randomized to receive Fexeric (n=96) \nor placebo (n=96).  \n \nAfter 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (± SD) change in serum phosphorus from baseline was −2.02 ± \n2.0 mg/dl for Fexeric and −2.21 ± 2.18 mg/dl for sevelamer carbonate, demonstrating non-inferiority \nof Fexeric to sevelamer. During the overall 52-week active-controlled period, the decrease in serum \nphosphorus (approximately 2.0 mg/dl following up to a 2 week washout period) and the percentage of \npatients who achieved and maintained serum phosphorus ≤ 5.5 mg/dl (approximately 62%) were \ncomparable in both the Fexeric and the active control groups (Table 3). During the subsequent 4-week \nplacebo-controlled period, the serum phosphorus levels remained stable in patients receiving Fexeric \n(mean decrease of 0.24 mg/dl), whereas patients receiving placebo had a mean increase of 1.79 mg/dl \n(p < 0.0001 for treatment difference).  \n \nIn the pivotal non-dialysis study 204, a total of 148 CKD ND patients with hyperphosphatemia and \niron deficiency anaemia received treatment with study drug; there were 141 patients in the intent-to-\ntreat population (Fexeric: 72 patients; Placebo: 69 patients). The starting dose of Fexeric was 3 tablets \na day (3 g/day) in divided doses with meals and was adjusted as needed to a maximum of 12 g/day in \norder to maintain serum phosphorus levels between 3.0 and 3.5 mg/dl. \n \nDuring the 12-week treatment period, patients treated with Fexeric had a significant decrease in serum \nphosphorus, compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001 for treatment difference) (Table 3). Urinary \nphosphorus excretion and FGF-23 were also significantly decreased relative to baseline in the \nCKD ND patients treated with Fexeric compared to patients treated with placebo. \n \nTable 3:  Summary of efficacy parameters on phosphorus homeostasis at Week 12 and Week 52 \n\nin Study 304 (CKD 5D) and at Week 12 in Study 204 (CKD ND) \n\nParameter \n\nStudy 304 (CKD 5D) Study 204 (CKD ND) \nFexeric \nN=281 \n\nActive Control \nN=146 \n\nFexeric \nN=72 \n\nPlacebo \nN=69 \n\nBaseline serum phosphorus \n(mean ± SD, mg/dl) \n\n7.41 ± 1.6 7.56 ± 1.7 4.5 ± 0.61 4.7 ± 0.60 \n\nSerum phosphorus change \nfrom baseline at Week 12§ \n(mean ± SD, mg/dl) \n\n−2.02 ± 2.0 \n\n−2.22 ± 2.1 \n(−2.21 ± 2.2  \n\nfor sevelamer \nonly) \n\n−0.7 ± 0.61 −0.3 ± 0.74 \n\nSerum phosphorus change \nfrom baseline at Week 52 \n(mean ± SD, mg/dl) \n\n−2.03 ± 2.0 −2.18 ± 2.3 NAP Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nParameter \n\nStudy 304 (CKD 5D) Study 204 (CKD ND) \nFexeric \nN=281 \n\nActive Control \nN=146 \n\nFexeric \nN=72 \n\nPlacebo \nN=69 \n\nProportion of serum \nphosphorus responders at \nWeek 12 (%) \n\n60.9* 63.7* 69.4** 27.5** \n\nProportion of serum \nphosphorus responders at \nWeek 52 (%) \n\n62.3* 63.0* NAP \n\n§ Primary endpoint in Study 304; Co-primary endpoint in Study 204.  \n*Proportion of patients achieving serum phosphorus ≤ 5.5 mg/dl in CKD 5D patients;  \n**Proportion of patients achieving serum phosphorus ≤ 4.0 mg/dl in CKD ND patients \nNAP: not applicable; SD: standard deviation \n \nEffects on iron homeostasis \n \nIn the pivotal dialysis study 304, CKD 5D patients treated with Fexeric, compared with patients \ntreated with active control, had significantly higher increases in ferritin and TSAT levels after \n52 weeks of treatment (Table 4), and significantly lower cumulative intravenous iron (96 versus \n149 mg/month) and ESA use (7,713 versus 9,183 IU/week) during the same period.

These patients were treated according to the \nrecommended dosing regimen without any safety concerns. \nThere was no evidence of hepatic impairment or significant alteration of hepatic enzymes across the \nclinical studies with Fexeric, including the long-term studies.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFormal pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed due to the medicine's predominantly \nlocalised primary mechanism of action in the GI tract.  \nExamination of serum iron storage parameters has shown that there is low systemic absorption of iron \nof approximately 1% from Fexeric. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe non clinical programme was based on 7 repeat dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs. The target \norgan for primary toxicity of ferric citrate is the GI tract, with evidence of mucosal erosion and acute \nto sub-acute inflammation of the GI tract in dogs at elevated doses. In iron replete dogs, microscopic \nand macroscopic findings in the liver were consistent with signs of iron accumulation. \n \nData on primary and secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of \nFexeric were derived from the repeat dose toxicology studies, and did not reveal safety concerns for \nhumans. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nInformation on genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development of ferric \ncitrate was bridged from scientific literature.

What Fexeric is and what it is used for \n \nFexeric contains ferric citrate coordination complex as the active ingredient. In adults with impaired \nkidney function it is used to lower high blood phosphorus levels. \n \nPhosphorus is contained in many foods. Patients with kidneys that do not work properly are not able to \neliminate phosphorus from their body adequately. This can lead to high phosphorus levels in the \nblood. Keeping the phosphorus level normal is important to maintain healthy bones and blood vessels \nand to prevent itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain or bone fractures. \n \nFexeric binds to the phosphorus from food in your digestive tract to prevent it from being absorbed \ninto your blood. The Fexeric-bound phosphorus is then excreted from your body in faeces.  \n \nYou may have been advised to follow a special diet to prevent the phosphorus in your blood rising to \nhigh levels. If this is the case, you must continue to follow the special diet even if you are taking \nFexeric. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Fexeric \n \nDo not take Fexeric \n- if you are allergic to ferric citrate coordination complex or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n- if you have low levels of phosphorus in your blood  \n- if you have a severe stomach or bowel disease such as stomach or bowel bleeding \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n- if you have haemochromatosis, a condition causing the body to absorb too much iron from the \ndiet \n\n- if you have any other disorder associated with too much iron \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fexeric if you have: \n- too much iron in your body  \n- bowel inflammation \n  \nMonitoring tests \nFexeric increases iron levels in your body. Because too much iron is unsafe, your blood will be tested \nat regular intervals to check iron levels. This blood test may be part of your routine tests for your \nkidney disease. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. The safety and \neffectiveness of Fexeric have not been studied in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Fexeric \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n The following medicines can affect or be affected by Fexeric: \n• other iron-containing medicines \n\nFexeric contains iron and your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your other iron-containing \nmedicines. \n\n• aluminium containing medicines \nFexeric should not be taken at the same time as aluminium containing medicines. \n\n• Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or might take the medicines below. Your \ndoctor may want to change the dose of these medicines or advise you to take these medicines 2 \nhours before or after Fexeric. Monitoring blood levels of these medicines may also be considered:  \n- ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, cefdinir: medicines to treat bacterial infections \n- valproic acid: a medicine to treat epilepsy and mental disorders \n- sertraline: a medicine to treat depression \n- methotrexate: a medicine to treat rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and the skin disease, psoriasis \n- alendronate: a medicine to treat decreased bone mass and density \n- levodopa: a medicine to treat Parkinson’s disease \n- levothyroxine: a medicine to treat thyroid hormone deficiency \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \n\n• pregnancy \nIf you are able to become pregnant, you must use birth control during treatment. If you become \npregnant during treatment, you must ask your doctor for advice. It is unknown whether Fexeric \nhas any effect on unborn babies. \n• breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you wish to breast-feed your baby. It is unknown whether Fexeric may pass \nthrough breast milk and affect your baby. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nFexeric has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nFexeric contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) and Allura Red AC (E129) \nThese may cause allergic reactions. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\n3. How to take Fexeric \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n\n- starting dose for adults: 3 to 6 tablets daily, in separated doses, with or immediately after \nmain meals of the day. Taking the tablets with meals will help the medicine to work. \n\nPatients not on dialysis require the lower starting dose: 3 tablets daily, in separated doses, with or \nimmediately after meals of the day. \nYour doctor may decrease or increase the starting dose depending on the level of phosphorus in \nyour blood. Your doctor will monitor the phosphorus levels regularly.
