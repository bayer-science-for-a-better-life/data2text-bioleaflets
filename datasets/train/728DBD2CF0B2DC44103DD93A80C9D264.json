See section 4.3.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection\nThe solution is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nErvebo is indicated for active immunization of individuals 18 years of age or older to protect against \nEbola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nThe use of Ervebo should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nErvebo should be administered by a trained healthcare worker.\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 18 years of age or older: one dose (1 mL) (see section 5.1).\n\nThe need for a booster dose has not been established.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of Ervebo in children aged 1 to 17 years have not yet been \nestablished (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.\n\nFor precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.\n\nErvebo should be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route. The preferred site is the deltoid area \nof the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh. Do not inject the vaccine \nintravascularly. No data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.\n\nCover the vaccination injection site or any vesicles with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive \nbandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.3). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.\n\nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to rice \nprotein listed in section 2.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nClose monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of anaphylaxis or \nanaphylactoid reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and \nsupervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the \nadministration of the vaccine.\n\nDuration of protection\n\nVaccination with Ervebo may not result in protection in all vaccinees. Vaccine efficacy has been \nestablished in the period \u226510 to \u226431 days after vaccination, however the duration of protection is not \nknown (see section 5.1). The use of other Ebola control measures should therefore not be\ninterrupted.\n\nVaccination of contacts of Ebola cases should occur as soon as possible (see section 5.1).\n\nStandard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease \n\nVaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for \npatients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers and other ancillary \nproviders who have been vaccinated should not alter their practices with regard to safe \ninjection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination.\n\nHealthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra \n\ninfection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and \n\ncontaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Samples taken from humans and \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nanimals for investigation of Ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in \n\nsuitably equipped laboratories.\n\nVaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with adequate \n\nmeasures.\n\nImmunocompromised individuals\n\nSafety and efficacy of Ervebo have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. \nImmunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to \nErvebo. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo in individuals with \nknown immunocompromised conditions or receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including the \nfollowing conditions:\n\n\uf0b7 Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined \nimmunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia, and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection. A CD4+ \nT-lymphocyte count threshold for use in asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals has not been \nestablished.\n\n\uf0b7 Current immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroid. This does not \ninclude individuals who are receiving topical, inhaled or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids \n(e.g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).\n\n\uf0b7 Diseases of the blood such as leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms \naffecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.\n\n\uf0b7 Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of \nthe potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.\n\nPregnant and breast-feeding women\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. See section \n4.6.\n\nTransmission\n\nVaccine virus might be present in biological fluids such as blood, urine, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids, \naqueous humor, breast milk, faeces, sweat, amniotic fluid, and placenta. Vaccine virus RNA has been \ndetected by PCR in the plasma of most of the adult subjects. Vaccine virus RNA was mainly detected \nfrom Day 1 to Day 7. Shedding of vaccine virus has been detected by PCR in urine or saliva in 19 out \nof 299 adult subjects and in skin vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult subjects. The vaccine virus RNA was \ndetected in a skin vesicle at 12 days post-vaccination in one of the four subjects.\n\nViral shedding was observed more frequently in children and adolescents (28/39) compared to adults.\n\nTransmission of vaccine virus through close personal contact is accepted as a theoretical possibility.\nVaccine recipients should avoid close contact with and exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and \nbodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. High-risk individuals include:\n\n\uf0b7 Immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see \nsection above),\n\n\uf0b7 Pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6),\n\uf0b7 Children <1 year of age.\n\nIndividuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they \nheal to minimize the risk of possible transmission of vaccine virus through open vesicles. Dispose of \ncontaminated bandages following institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management \npolicy. See section 5.3.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nInadvertent transmission of vaccine virus to animals and livestock is also theoretically possible, see \nbelow. \n\nIndividuals administered Ervebo should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks post-vaccination.\n\nTransmission to animals and livestock\n\nTransmission of vaccine virus through close contact with livestock is accepted as a theoretical \npossibility. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily fluids \nfor at least 6 weeks following vaccination. Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the \nvaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. Dispose of contaminated bandages following \ninstitutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management policy. See section 5.3.\n\nConcurrent illness\n\nVaccination should be postponed in subjects experiencing moderate or severe febrile illness. The \npresence of a minor infection should not result in deferral of vaccination.\n\nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders\n\nThe vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these \nindividuals.\n\nProtection against filovirus disease\n\nThe vaccine will not prevent disease caused by Filoviruses other than Zaire Ebola virus.\n\nImpact to serological testing \n\nFollowing vaccination with Ervebo, individuals may test positive for Ebola glycoprotein (GP) nucleic \nacids, antigens, or antibodies against Ebola GP, which are targets for certain Ebola diagnostic tests. \nTherefore, diagnostic testing for Ebola should target non-GP sections of the Ebola virus.\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be\nessentially sodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nAs there are no data on co-administration of Ervebo with other vaccines, the concomitant use of \nErvebo with other vaccines is not recommended.\n\nImmune globulin (IG), blood or plasma transfusions should not be given concomitantly with Ervebo. \nAdministration of immune globulins, blood or plasma transfusions administered 3 months before or up \nto 1 month after Ervebo administration may interfere with the expected immune response.\n\nIt is unknown whether concurrent administration of antiviral medication including interferons could \nimpact vaccine virus replication and efficacy.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nThere are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Ervebo in \npregnant women, or women who became pregnant after receiving the vaccine. The safety of Ervebo\nhas not been established in pregnant women.\n\nAs there are limitations to available data, including the small number of cases, caution should be \nexercised in drawing conclusions. Lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and \nneonatal outcomes in the affected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. Nevertheless \nconsidering the severity of EVD, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of \nexposure to Ebola infection.\n\nPregnancy should be avoided for 2 months following vaccination. Women of child-bearing potential\nshould use an effective contraceptive method. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether the vaccine virus is secreted in human milk.\n\nA risk to the newborns/infants from breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded. \n\nEvaluation of the vaccine virus in animal milk has not been conducted. When Ervebo is administered \nto female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in offspring, likely due to acquisition \nof maternal antibodies via placental transfer during gestation and via lactation. See section 5.3.\n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Ervebo taking into \naccount the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. In certain \ncircumstances, where alternatives to breastfeeding are limited, the immediate need and health benefits \nto the infant should be taken into consideration and balanced with the mother\u2019s need for Ervebo. Both \nmay present compelling needs that should be considered before vaccination of the mother.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on fertility effects in humans.\n\nAnimal studies in female rats do not indicate harmful effects (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects of Ervebo on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\nErvebo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nAnaphylaxis was reported very rarely (0.006%) in clinical trials. \n\nThe most common injection-site adverse reactions were injection-site pain (70.3%), swelling (16.7%)\nand erythema (13.7%).\n\nThe most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination with Ervebo were \nheadache (36.9%), pyrexia (34.3%), myalgia (32.5%), fatigue (18.5%), arthralgia (17.1%), nausea\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\n(8.0%), chills (6.3%), arthritis (3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and abdominal pain (1.4%). \nIn general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were mild to moderate in\nintensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nFrequencies are reported as:\nVery common (\u22651/10), Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), Rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very rare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness.\n\nTable 1: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions considered related to vaccination\nMedDRA-System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Frequency\nImmune system disorders: Anaphylactic reaction Very Rare\n\nNervous system disorders: Headache Very common\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain\nNausea\n\nCommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders:\n\nRash\u00a7 Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders:\n\nArthralgia\u00a7\n\nMyalgia \nVery common\n\nArthritis\u00a7 Common\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions:\n\nPyrexia\nFatigue\nInjection site pain \nInjection site erythema\nInjection site swelling\n\nVery common\n\nChills\nHyperhidrosis (sweats)\n\nCommon\n\n\u00a7See description of selected adverse reactions.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nArthralgia and arthritis\nArthralgia was generally reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in \nintensity, and resolved within one week after onset. Arthritis (arthritis, joint effusion, joint swelling, \nosteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) was generally reported within the first few weeks \nfollowing vaccination. In clinical trials with reports of arthritis, the median onsets were between 10 \nand 12 days (range from 0 to 25 days). Arthritis has been reported by subjects in clinical trials at a \nfrequency that ranged from 0% in several protocols to 23.5% in one Phase 1 study. The majority of \narthritis reactions were mild to moderate in severity. The median duration of arthritis across clinical \ntrials in which arthritis was reported ranged from 2 days to 81.5 days (including duration of recurrent \narthritis) with a maximum of 330 days. The reasons for differences in arthritis reporting across trials \nare not known but may be due to differences in study populations or outcome reporting. In the Phase 1 \nstudy with the highest rate of arthritis, 6 of 24 patients (25%) who reported arthritis after vaccination \nhad persistent joint symptoms two years after vaccination. In a small number of subjects, the vaccine \nvirus was recovered from joint effusion samples, suggestive of a virally-mediated process post-\nvaccination.\n\nRash\nRash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash (2.3%), vesicular rash (0.5%), \ndermatitis (0.3%), or cutaneous vasculitis (0.01%) in clinical trials. In different trials, rash was \nreported with median onsets of 7.5 to 10.5 days (range from 0 to 47 days). The median durations \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nreported were between 6 to 18 days. In 6 out of 18 subjects tested, the vaccine virus was detected in \nrashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated \nprocess post-vaccination.\n\nTransient decrease in white blood cells\nTransient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells in the first 3 days \nfollowing vaccination have been observed very commonly in Phase 1/2 studies; these events generally\nresolved after the first week post-vaccination. No adverse events of infections were observed in Phase \n1/2 trials.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nAcross the Phase 1 through Phase 3 trials, 234 children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age received a \ndose of Ervebo.\n\nThe safety profile of Ervebo in children and adolescents 6 to17 years of age was generally similar to \nthat observed in adults. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo cases of overdose have been reported.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine, ATC code: J07BX02\n\nMechanism of action\n\nErvebo consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vector expressing \nthe envelope glycoprotein gene of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP). Immunization of \nsubjects with the vaccine results in an immune response and protection from Zaire Ebola Virus \nDisease (EVD). The relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity to \nprotection from Zaire Ebola virus are unknown.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nThe clinical development program included four Phase 2/3 (Protocols 009-012) clinical trials. All \nsubjects received a single dose of vaccine. Clinical efficacy of Ervebo was assessed in Protocol 010.\n\nProtocol 010 (Ring vaccination study) was a Phase 3 open-label cluster-randomized trial of ring \nvaccination (vaccinating contacts and contacts of contacts [CCCs] of index Ebola cases) which\nevaluated efficacy and safety of Ervebo in Guinea. In this trial, 9,096 subjects \u226518 years of age who \nwere considered CCCs of an index case with laboratory-confirmed EVD were randomized to \nimmediate (4,539 subjects in 51 clusters) or 21 days delayed (4,557 subjects in 47 clusters) \nvaccination with Ervebo. Of those 9,096 subjects, 4,160 received Ervebo (2,119 subjects were \nvaccinated in the immediate arm and 2,041 subjects were vaccinated in the delayed arm). The median \nage of consenting CCCs was 35 years old. The final primary analysis included 2,108 subjects (51 \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nclusters) vaccinated in the immediate arm and 1,429 subjects (46 clusters) eligible and consented on \nDay 0 in the delayed arm.\n\nThe final primary analysis was to assess efficacy against laboratory confirmed EVD by comparing \nincidence of cases occurring 10 to 31 days post-randomization for those vaccinated in the immediate \nvaccination rings versus incidence of cases for subjects who consented on Day 0 in the delayed \nvaccination rings. Vaccine efficacy was 100% (unadjusted 95% CI: 63.5% to 100%; 95% CI adjusted \nfor multiplicity: 14.4% to 100%) (0 cases in the immediate arm; 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed \narm). Randomization was stopped after an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the pre-\nspecified alpha level of 0.0027. Of the 10 cases, 7 were in contacts, and 3 in contacts-of-contacts.\nUncertainties remain as to the level, duration and type of protection given the methodological \nlimitations and the exceptional circumstances experienced during the trial. \n\nClinical immunogenicity\n\nNo immune correlates of protection have been defined to date.\n\nProtocol 009 Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL) was a Phase 2 \nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of \nEbola vaccine candidates including Ervebo. This trial compared Ervebo to normal saline placebo in \n1,000 adults \u226518 years of age in Liberia.\n\nProtocol 011 named Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) was a Phase \n2/3 randomized open-label trial which evaluated safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in adults \n\u226518 years of age working in healthcare facilities or on frontline activities related to the Ebola response \nin Sierra Leone. In this trial, 8,673 adult subjects were enrolled and 8,651 with valid consents \nrandomized to immediate (within 7 days of enrolment) or deferred (18 to 24 weeks after enrolment) \nvaccination with Ervebo. An immunogenicity sub-study included 508 subjects who were vaccinated \nand provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity.\n\nProtocol 012 was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the \nsafety and immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot (approximately five times \nhigher than the dose in consistency lots and dose used in other Phase 2/3 trials) of Ervebo compared to \nnormal saline placebo. A total of 1,197 healthy subjects 18 to 65 years of age were enrolled in the US, \nCanada, and Spain.\n\nImmunogenicity testing has been performed in Protocol 009, Protocol 011 and Protocol 012, and \nincludes the assessment of binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to purified Kikwit ZEBOV GP \nby validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (GP-ELISA) as well as validated neutralization of \nvaccine virus by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\n\nAs shown in Tables 2 and 3, the geometric mean titers (GMT) of GP-ELISA and PRNT increased \nfrom pre-vaccination to post-vaccination. Over 93.8% of vaccine recipients met seroresponse criteria \ndefined as a \u22652-fold increase from baseline and \u2265200 EU/mL at any time post-vaccination by GP-\nELISA and over 80.4% of subjects met seroresponse criteria defined as a \u22654-fold increase from \nbaseline at any time post-vaccination by PRNT. Over 80.1% of subjects continued to meet the \nseroresponse criteria for GP-ELISA and over 63.5% of vaccine recipients continued to meet \nseroresponse criteria for PRNT at 12 months. The clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data is \ncurrently not known.\n\nEfficacy data was obtained in Protocol 010 in Guinea and immunogenicity data was obtained in \nProtocol 009 in Liberia, Protocol 011 in Sierra Leone, and Protocol 012 in the United States, Canada, \nand Europe. Baseline seropositivity, gamma irradiation of specimens to reduce risk of wild-type Ebola \nvirus infection of laboratory workers, and other factors may impact the immune response to vaccine, \nwhich results in a higher immune response in Protocol 012.

In a Phase 1 trial in children 6 to 17 years of age (median \nage = 10), non-validated ELISA and Pseudovirion Neutralization Assay (PsVNA) results at Day 28 \nand Day 180 post-vaccination were similar to those observed in adults in the same study (see also \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nErvebo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of Ebola disease (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n---\n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme.\nThis means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every\nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.\n\nWhen Ervebo was administered to female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in \nfoetuses and offspring, likely due to trans-placental transfer during gestation and with the acquisition \nof maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively (see section 4.6).\n\nErvebo administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or \nembryonic/foetal development.\n\nErvebo administered to female rats had no effects on development or behaviour of the offspring.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nThe vaccine virus is a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO). An ERA was conducted to determine \nthe potential impact of this vaccine on human health and the environment. Because this vaccine is \nbased on VSV, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs), the risk assessment included \nspecies that are relevant for the wild type (wt) VSV backbone of this vaccine.\n\nIn a biodistribution study conducted in non-human primates, vaccine virus RNA was detected in \nlymphoid organs up to 112 days post-vaccination. However, infectious virus was detected at Day 1 \nand persistent infectious virus was not detected at any subsequent timepoints measured (Days 56, 84\nand 112).\n\nBased on limited shedding in adults, the results of a toxicity study in non-human primates, and lack of \nhorizontal transmission in pigs, the overall risk of Ervebo to human health and the environment is \n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nconsidered negligible. However, as a precaution, vaccinees should attempt to avoid exposure of \nlivestock to blood and bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination to avoid the theoretical \nrisk of spread of the vaccine virus. People who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine \nshould cover the vesicles until they heal. Cover the vaccination site or any vesicles with an adequate \nbandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect \nagainst direct contact with vesicle fluid (see section 4.2). The bandage may be removed when there is \nno visible fluid leakage. To avoid unintended exposure to livestock, ensure medical waste and other \ncleaning materials do not come in contact with livestock.\n\nSee sections 4.4 and 6.6 for further information.\n\n6.

Upon removal from the freezer, the \nproduct should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and also a new discard \ndate (in place of the labelled expiry date). Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re-frozen.\n\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\nSolution for 1 dose in a vial (type I glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl) and a flip-off plastic cap with \naluminium seal.\n\nPack size of 10 vials.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\n\uf0b7 The vaccine is stored frozen at -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C and should be removed from the freezer and \nthawed in less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. Do not thaw the vial in a refrigerator\nas it is not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. The thawed vial should then \nbe gently inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe. The vaccine should appear \n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nas a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid with no particulates visible. Discard the \nvaccine if particulates are present.\n\n\uf0b7 Withdraw the entire content of the vaccine from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe.\n\nIf feasible, the waste liquid from eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before \ndiscarding into the drain.\n\nAny unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed in compliance with the institutional \nguidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate.\n\nIf breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are proven \nto reduce viral infection potential after only a few minutes.\n\n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are vaccinated because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your healthcare worker.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your healthcare worker. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Ervebo is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you receive Ervebo\n3. How Ervebo is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Ervebo\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Ervebo is and what it is used for\n\n\uf0b7 Ervebo is a vaccine for adults who are 18 years of age and older.\n\uf0b7 Ervebo is given to protect you from getting Ebola virus disease caused by the Zaire Ebola virus, \n\nwhich is a type of Ebola virus. This vaccine will not protect you against the other types of Ebola \nvirus.\n\n\uf0b7 Because Ervebo does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give you Ebola virus disease.\n\nYour healthcare worker may recommend that you receive this vaccine in an emergency involving the \nspread of Ebola virus disease.\n\nWhat is Ebola?\n\uf0b7 Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. If you get Ebola, it can kill you. People catch Ebola \n\nfrom people or animals who are infected with Ebola or who died from Ebola.\n\uf0b7 You can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast \n\nmilk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.\n\uf0b7 You can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or \n\nanimal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).\n\uf0b7 Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.\n\nYour healthcare worker will talk to you and then together you can decide if you should receive this \nvaccine.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Ervebo\n\nDo not receive Ervebo if you:\n\uf0b7 are allergic to Ervebo, rice, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).\nYou should not receive Ervebo if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \nhealthcare worker.\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nWarnings and precautions\nThis vaccine might not protect everyone who receives it and the length of time you are protected from \nEbola by Ervebo is not known.\n\nContinue to follow your healthcare worker\u2019s recommendations to protect yourself from Ebola \ninfection after you get this vaccine.\n\nWashing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like \nEbola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to \nperson.\n\nProper hand washing methods are described below.\n\uf0b7 Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no \n\nneed to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.\n\uf0b7 Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand \n\nsanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.\n\nWhile in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:\n\uf0b7 Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, \n\nsemen, and vaginal fluids).\n\uf0b7 Items that may have come in contact with an infected person\u2019s blood or body fluids (such as \n\nclothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).\n\uf0b7 Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.\n\uf0b7 Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these \n\nanimals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.\n\uf0b7 Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until you \n\nknow the virus is gone from the semen.\n\nIf you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving Ervebo, cover it until it heals. Put the used \nplasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them in the waste bin to to make \nsure that people with a weak immune system or animals do not come into contact with the plasters and \nbandages.\n\nTalk to your healthcare worker before you receive Ervebo if you:\n\nHave had allergic reactions to vaccines or medicines\n\uf0b7 If you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine or medicine, talk to your healthcare \n\nworker before you receive this vaccine.\n\nHave a weak immune system\nIf your immune system is weak (which means your body is less able to fight off diseases), you might \nnot be able to receive Ervebo. You might have a weak immune system if:\n\uf0b7 you have HIV infection or AIDS,\n\uf0b7 you are taking certain medicines that make your immune system weak such as \n\nimmunosuppressants or corticosteroids,\n\uf0b7 you have cancer or a blood problem that makes your immune system weak,\n\uf0b7 a member of your family has a weak immune system.\nIf you think you might have a weak immune system, ask your healthcare worker if you should receive\nthis vaccine. If you do get the vaccine and have a weak immune system, the vaccine may not work as \nwell as in people with a normal immune system.\n\nAre in contact with vulnerable individuals\nTell your healthcare worker if in the 6 weeks after you receive Ervebo you might be in close contact \nwith or in the same household as:\n\uf0b7 babies who are less than 1 year old, \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\n\uf0b7 someone who may be pregnant or breast-feeding,\n\uf0b7 someone who has a weak immune system.\nThis is because you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to them through your body fluids.\n\nIf you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving Ervebo, cover it until it heals. Put the used \nplasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them away in the garbage bin to \navoid having people with a weak immune system come into contact with the plasters and bandages.\n\nPlan to donate blood\n\uf0b7 Do not donate blood for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine.\n\nAre in contact with farm animals\n\uf0b7 Make sure your blood or body fluids do not come into close contact with farm animals for at \n\nleast 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine. This is because of a possibility that you could pass \non the virus in the vaccine to the animals.\n\n\uf0b7 If you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving Ervebo, cover it until it heals.\n\uf0b7 Put the used plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them away in the \n\ngarbage bin to avoid having animals come into contact with the plasters and bandages.\n\nHave a fever (high temperature)\n\uf0b7 If you have a fever (high temperature), you should talk to your healthcare worker before \n\nreceiving Ervebo. The vaccination may have to be delayed until your fever is gone.\n\uf0b7 A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem but talk to your healthcare worker\n\nbefore receiving Ervebo.\n\nHave a bleeding disorder or bruise easily\n\uf0b7 Tell your healthcare worker if you have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily. Ervebo\n\nmight make you bleed or bruise where the vaccine is injected.\n\nTesting for Ebola after you receive Ervebo\n\uf0b7 You may test positive for Ebola virus after you receive Ervebo. This does not mean that you \n\nhave Ebola. Tell your healthcare worker that you have received Ervebo. Your healthcare worker\nmight need to do another test.\n\nIf any of the above warnings and precautions apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your healthcare \nworker before receiving Ervebo.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nIf you or your child is under 18 years old, talk to your healthcare worker. It is not known if it is safe \nand works in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Ervebo\nTell your healthcare worker if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or \nvaccines.\n\nNo studies have looked at how other medicines or vaccines and Ervebo might interact with each other.\nUse of Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.\n\nIf you plan to receive blood or blood products\nDo not receive this vaccine at the same time that you get blood or blood products. Ervebo might not \nwork as well if you get blood or blood products 3 months before or up to 1 month after vaccination.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your healthcare worker for advice before you receive this vaccine. They will help you decide if \nyou should receive Ervebo.\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\n\uf0b7 Do not become pregnant for 2 months after you receive Ervebo. Women who are able to become \npregnant should use an effective method of birth control. It is not known if Ervebo will harm you \nor your unborn baby. It is also not known if it can pass to your baby through your breast milk.\n\n\uf0b7 If you might be in close contact with, or in the same household as someone who may be pregnant \nor breast-feeding during the 6 weeks after you receive Ervebo, tell your healthcare worker. This is \nbecause you could pass the vaccine to them through your body fluids.\n\nErvebo contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium\u2013\nfree\u2019.\n\n3. How Ervebo is given\n\nErvebo is given by a healthcare worker. It is given as a single injection (dose of 1 mL) in the top of \nyour arm or the outside of your thigh.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your healthcare worker.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines, Ervebo can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious side effects are rare. Get medical care right away if you have symptoms of an allergic reaction, \nwhich may include:\n\n\uf0b7 wheezing or trouble breathing,\n\uf0b7 swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or other parts of the body,\n\uf0b7 generalized itching, redness, flushing or itchy bumps on the skin.\n\nOther side effects:\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 Headache,\n\uf0b7 Joint pain,\n\uf0b7 Muscle aches,\n\uf0b7 Fever,\n\uf0b7 Feeling tired,\n\uf0b7 Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 Stomach pain, \n\uf0b7 Nausea,\n\uf0b7 Skin rash,\n\uf0b7 Joint swelling,\n\uf0b7 Chills, \n\uf0b7 Excessive sweating.\n\nCertain white blood cell counts can decrease below normal after vaccination but this decrease has not \nresulted in illness and the counts return to normal.\n\nMost side effects go away within a few days. Joint pain and swelling may last for weeks or months in \nsome people. In some people joint pain and swelling may come back after initially going away.\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nTell your healthcare worker if you get any of the side effects listed above.\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nThe vaccine has been studied in a small number of children and adolescents who were 6 to 17 years of \nage. Overall, the side effects in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your healthcare worker. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine.\n\n5.

This means that there is more evidence to come \nabout this medicine.\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year and \nthis leaflet will be updated as necessary.\n\nOther sources of information\n\nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nThis leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website.\n\n<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>\n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:\n\nStandard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease\n\n \n\nmailto:cyprus_info@merck.com\nmailto:medicalinformation.it@merck.com\nmailto:msd.slovenia@merck.com\nmailto:croatia_info@merck.com\n\n\n30\n\nVaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for \npatients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers, and other ancillary \nproviders who have been vaccinated, should not alter their practices with regard to safe \ninjection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination.\n\nStandard precautions, as outlined by WHO, include the following:\n\n\uf0b7 Basic hand hygiene\n\uf0b7 Respiratory hygiene\n\uf0b7 Use of PPE (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials)\n\uf0b7 Safe injection practices\n\uf0b7 Safe burial practices\n\nHealthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra \n\ninfection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and \n\ncontaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 \n\nmetre) of patients with Ebola Virus Disease, healthcare workers should wear face protection (a face \n\nshield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile \n\ngloves for some procedures).\n\nLaboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of \n\nEbola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.\n\nVaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with the following \n\nmeasures:\n\uf0b7 Hand washing \n\uf0b7 Avoid contact with blood and body fluids \n\uf0b7 Safe burial practices\n\uf0b7 Safe sex\n\uf0b7 Avoid contact with bats and non-human primates or blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from \n\nthese animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.\n\nInstructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration\n\n\uf0b7 Ervebo is stored frozen at -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C and should be removed from the freezer and thawed \nin less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. Do not thaw the vial in a refrigerator as it is \nnot guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. The thawed vial should then be gently \ninverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe.\n\n\uf0b7 After thawing, Ervebo should be used immediately; however, in-use stability data have \ndemonstrated that once thawed, the vaccine can be stored for up to 14 days at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C prior \nto use. At the end of 14 days, the vaccine should be used or discarded. Upon removal from the \nfreezer, the product should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and \nalso a new discard date (in place of the labelled expiry date). Once thawed, the vaccine cannot \nbe re-frozen.\n\n\uf0b7 Ervebo is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid. Discard the vaccine if particulates are \npresent.\n\n\uf0b7 Ervebo should be administered intramuscularly. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly. No \ndata are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.\n\n\uf0b7 Ervebo should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.\n\uf0b7 Withdraw the entire content of Ervebo from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe. The \n\npreferred injection site is the deltoid area of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral \narea of the thigh. Cover the injection site with gauze or bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or \ngauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle \nfluid. The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\n\uf0b7 Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in compliance with the institutional \nguidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate. If \nbreakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are \nproven to reduce viral infection potential after only a few minutes. If feasible, the waste liquid \nfrom eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before discarding into the drain.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nANNEX IV\n\nCONCLUSIONS ON THE GRANTING OF THE CONDITIONAL MARKETING \nAUTHORISATION PRESENTED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY\n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on:\n\n\uf0b7 Conditional marketing authorisation\n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \n\nfavourable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as further \n\nexplained in the European Public Assessment Report.\n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

by ervebo is not known. continue to follow your healthcare worker's recommendations to protect yourself from ebola infection after you get this vaccine. washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like ebola virus. it reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to person. proper hand washing methods are described below. use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. there is no need to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands. use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. do not use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. while in an area affected by ebola, it is important to avoid the following: contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal fluids). items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment). funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from ebola. contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source. contact with semen from a man who had ebola. you should follow safe sex practices until you know the virus is gone from the semen. if you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving ervebo, cover it until it heals. put the used plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them in the waste bin to to make sure that people with a weak immune system or animals do not come into contact with the plasters and bandages. talk to your healthcare worker before you receive ervebo if you: have had allergic reactions to vaccines or medicines if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine or medicine, talk to your healthcare worker before you receive this vaccine. have a weak immune system if your immune system is weak (which means your body is less able to fight off diseases), you might not be able to receive ervebo. you might have a weak immune system if: you have hiv infection or aids, you are taking certain medicines that make your immune system weak such as immunosuppressants or corticosteroids, you have cancer or a blood problem that makes your immune system weak, a member of your family has a weak immune system. if you think you might have a weak immune system, ask your healthcare worker if you should receive this vaccine. if you do get the vaccine and have a weak immune system, the vaccine may not work as well as in people with a normal immune system. are in contact with vulnerable individuals tell your healthcare worker if in the 6 weeks after you receive ervebo you might be in close contact with or in the same household as: babies who are less than 1 year old, 25 someone who may be pregnant or breast-feeding, someone who has a weak immune system. this is because you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to them through your body fluids. if you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving ervebo, cover it until it heals. put the used plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them away in the garbage bin to avoid having people with a weak immune system come into contact with the plasters and bandages. plan to donate blood do not donate blood for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine. are in contact with farm animals make sure your blood or body fluids do not come into close contact with farm animals for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine. this is because of a possibility that you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to the animals. if you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving ervebo, cover it until it heals. put the used plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them away in the garbage bin to avoid having animals come into contact with the plasters and bandages. have a fever (high temperature) if you have a fever (high temperature), you should talk to your healthcare worker before receiving ervebo. the vaccination may have to be delayed until your fever is gone. a minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem but talk to your healthcare worker before receiving ervebo. have a bleeding disorder or bruise easily tell your healthcare worker if you have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily. ervebo might make you bleed or bruise where the vaccine is injected. testing for ebola after you receive ervebo you may test positive for ebola virus after you receive ervebo. this does not mean that you have ebola. tell your healthcare worker that you have received ervebo. your healthcare worker might need to do another test. if any of the above warnings and precautions apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your healthcare worker before receiving ervebo. children and adolescents if you or your child is under 18 years old, talk to your healthcare worker. it is not known if it is safe and works in children and adolescents. other medicines and ervebo tell your healthcare worker if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines. no studies have looked at how other medicines or vaccines and ervebo might interact with each other. use of ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended. if you plan to receive blood or blood products do not receive this vaccine at the same time that you get blood or blood products. ervebo might not work as well if you get blood or blood products 3 months before or up to 1 month after vaccination. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your healthcare worker for advice before you receive this vaccine. they will help you decide if you should receive ervebo. do not become pregnant for 2 months after you receive ervebo. women who are able to become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control. it is not known if ervebo will harm you or your unborn baby. it is also not known if it can pass to your baby through your breast milk. if you might be in close contact with, or in the same household as someone who may be pregnant or breast-feeding during the 6 weeks after you receive ervebo, tell your healthcare worker. this is because you could pass the vaccine to them through your body fluids. ervebo contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ervebo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "allergic", "Type": "PROBLEM",

redness, flushing or itchy bumps on the skin. other side effects: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): headache, joint pain, muscle aches, fever, feeling tired, pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): stomach pain, nausea, skin rash, joint swelling, chills, excessive sweating. certain white blood cell counts can decrease below normal after vaccination but this decrease has not resulted in illness and the counts return to normal. most side effects go away within a few days. joint pain and swelling may last for weeks or months in some people. in some people joint pain and swelling may come back after initially going away. tell your healthcare worker if you get any of the side effects listed above. additional side effects in children and adolescents the vaccine has been studied in a small number of children and adolescents who were 6 to 17 years of age. overall, the side effects in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your healthcare worker. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also
