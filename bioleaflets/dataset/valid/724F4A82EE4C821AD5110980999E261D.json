PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \nClear colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nMenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older \nagainst invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nPosology \n \nPrimary vaccination: \n\u2022 Individuals 12 months of age and older: One single dose (0.5 mL). \nBooster vaccination: \n\u2022 A single 0.5 mL dose of MenQuadfi may be used to boost subjects who have previously received a \n\nmeningococcal vaccine containing the same serogroups (see section 5.1). \n\u2022 There are no data available to indicate the need for or timing of a booster dose of MenQuadfi (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nOther paediatric population \nThe safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi in individuals under 12 months of age have not yet been \nestablished.  \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid region or anterolateral thigh depending on the \nrecipient's age and muscle mass. \n \nFor instructions on handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or after previous \nadministration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nMenQuadfi should not be administered subcutaneously, intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nIt is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with \nregard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical examination. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. \n \nIntercurrent illness \nVaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. However, \nthe presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination. \n \nSyncope \nSyncope (fainting) and other anxiety\u2010related reactions can occur following or even before any \nvaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent \nfalling or injury and to manage syncope.  \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \nMenQuadfi should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs \nthe risk of administration. \n \nProtection \nMenQuadfi will only protect against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y. The vaccine will not \nprotect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups.  \n \nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all vaccine recipients. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nWaning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against serogroup A when using human complement in the \nassay (hSBA) has been reported for other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. The clinical relevance of \nthis observation is unknown. No data are available for MenQuadfi. \n \nLower hSBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) against serogroup A have been observed after a single dose \nof MenQuadfi was administered to toddlers who previously received serogroup C meningococcal \nconjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM) during infancy. Nevertheless, seroprotection rates were comparable \nbetween treatment groups (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. This \naspect might be considered for individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC-CRM \nvaccine in their first year of life.  \n \nImmunodeficiency \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with \nimmunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited (see section 4.5). Persons with \nfamilial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons receiving treatments \nthat inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk of invasive \ndisease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y, even if they develop antibodies \nfollowing vaccination with MenQuadfi. No data on immunocompromised patients are available. \n\nTetanus immunisation \nImmunisation with MenQuadfi vaccine does not substitute for routine tetanus immunisation. \nCo-administration of MenQuadfi with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine does not impair the response to \ntetanus toxoid or impact the safety. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nUse with other vaccines \nInjection sites on separate limbs and separate syringes must be used in the case of concomitant \nadministration. \n \nFor ages 12-23 months, MenQuadfi can be co-administered with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine \n(MMR) and varicella vaccine (V), combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, \nincluding combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B (HBV), inactivated poliovirus (IPV) or \nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) such as DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib (Hib conjugated to tetanus toxoid) \nvaccine and 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine (PCV-13). \n \nFor ages 10-17 years, MenQuadfi can be co-administered with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, \ncomponent) vaccine (adsorbed, reduced antigen(s) content) (Tdap) and human papillomavirus vaccine \n(recombinant, adsorbed) (HPV). \n \nMenQuadfi can be administered concomitantly with PCV-13. Lower hSBA GMTs on day 30 post-dose \nfor serogroup A has been observed when given concommitantly. The clinical relevance of this \nobservation is unknown. As a precaution in children 12-23 months of age at high risk for serogroup A \ndisease, consideration might be given for administration of MenQuadfi and PCV-13 vaccines separately. \n \nMeningococcal vaccine na\u00efve children aged 10-17 years had non inferior response for PT and lower \nantibody responses to FHA, PRN and FIM when Tdap vaccine was administered concomitantly with \nMenQuadfi and HPV compared to co-administration with HPV vaccine alone. The clinical implications \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nof the observed pertussis antigen responses also observed with the existing quadrivalent meningococcal \nconjugate vaccines are unknown. \n \nConcomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably \ncontralateral.  \n \nConcomitant administration of MenQuadfi and other vaccines than those listed above has not been \nstudied. \n \nUse with systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment an adequate immune response \nmay not be elicited (see also section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \nThere is limited amount of data on the use of MenQuadfi in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nMenQuadfi should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefits for the mother outweigh the \npotential risks, including those for the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether MenQuadfi is excreted in human milk. MenQuadfi should only be used during \nbreast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the potential risks. \n \nFertility \nA developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rabbits. There were no effects \non mating performances or female fertility. No study was conducted on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nMenQuadfi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHowever, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may temporarily affect \nthe ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi in individuals 12 months of age and older was evaluated in \nseven randomized, active-controlled, multi-centre pivotal studies.  In these studies, 6,308 subjects \nreceived either a primary dose (N=5,906) or a booster dose (N=402) of MenQuadfi and were included in \nthe safety analyses. This included 1,389 toddlers aged 12 through 23 months of age, 498 children aged 2 \nthrough 9 years, 2,289 adolescents aged 10 through 17 years, 1,684 adults aged 18 through 55 years, \n199 older adults aged 56 through 64 years, and 249 elderly aged 65 years and older. Of these, \n392 adolescents received MenQuadfi co-administered with Tdap and HPV, and 589 toddlers received \nMenQuadfi co-administered with MMR+V (N=189), DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib (N=200) or PCV-13 (N=200). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions within 7 days after vaccination with a single dose of \nMenQuadfi alone in toddlers 12 through 23 months of age were irritability (36.7%) and injection site \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\ntenderness (30.6%) and in ages 2 years and above were injection site pain (38.7%) and myalgia (30.5%). \nThese adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. \nRates of adverse reactions after a booster dose of MenQuadfi in adolescents and adults at least 15 years of \nage were comparable to those seen in adolescents and adults who received a primary dose of MenQuadfi.  \n \nRates of adverse reactions within 7 days following vaccination among toddlers were comparable when \nMMR+V were given concomitantly with or without MenQuadfi, and when DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib was given \nwith or without MenQuadfi. Overall, the rates of adverse reactions were higher in toddlers who received \nPCV-13 given concomitantly with MenQuadfi (36.5%) than in toddlers who received PCV-13 alone \n(17.2%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, as listed below, have been identified from clinical studies conducted \nwith MenQuadfi when given alone to subjects 2 years of age and older. The safety profile observed in \ntoddlers aged 12 through 23 months is presented in the paediatric population section. \nThe adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories: \nVery common (\u22651/10); \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10);  \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100);  \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000).  \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions following administration of MenQuadfi from \nclinical trials in subjects 2 years of age and above \n \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nRare Lymphadenopathy \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \nUncommon Dizziness \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Vomiting, nausea \nRare Diarrhoea, stomach pain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRare Urticaria, pruritus, rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nRare Pain in extremity \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Malaise \nInjection site pain \n\nCommon Fever \nAt the injection site:  swelling, erythema \n\nUncommon Fatigue \nAt the injection site: pruritus, warmth, bruising, rash \n\nRare Chills, axillary pain \nAt the injection site: induration \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile of MenQuadfi in children and adolescents 2 through 17 years of age was generally \ncomparable to that in adults. Injection site erythema and swelling at the MenQuadfi injection site were \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nreported more frequently in children 2 through 9 years of age (very common) than in the older age \ngroups. \n \nIn toddlers 12 through 23 months of age, injection site erythema and swelling (very common) at the \nMenQuadfi injection site, vomiting (common) and diarrhoea (common), were reported more frequently \nthan in the older age groups. The following additional reactions, as listed below in Table 2, have been \nreported very commonly or commonly following administration of MenQuadfi in toddlers during clinical \ntrials:  \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions following administration of MenQuadfi from \nclinical trials in subjects 12 months through 23 months \n \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nMetabolic and nutrition disorders Very common Appetite lost \nPsychiatric disorders Very common Irritability \n\nUncommon Insomnia \nNervous system disorders Very common Drowsiness \nGastrointestinal disorders Common Vomiting, diarrhoea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery Common Abnormal crying \nAt the injection site: tenderness/pain, erythema, \nswelling \n\nCommon Fever \nUncommon At the injection site: pruritus, induration, bruising, \n\nrash \n \nOlder population \nOverall, within 7 days after vaccination with a single dose of MenQuadfi, the same injection site and \nsystemic adverse reactions were observed in older (\u226556 years of age) and younger adults (18 through \n55 years old) but at lower frequencies; except for injection site pruritus, which was more frequent \n(common) in older adults. These adverse reactions mostly were mild or moderate in intensity. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nOverdose with MenQuadfi is unlikely due to its presentation as a single dose vial. In the event of \noverdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: meningococcal vaccines \n \nATC code: J07AH08  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \nMechanism of action \nAnti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal diseases via complement \nmediated bactericidal activity.  \nMenQuadfi induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of \nNeisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. \n \nImmunogenicity \nThe immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for primary vaccination in toddlers (12-23 months of \nage), children and adolescents (2-17 years of age), adults (18-55 years of age) and older adults (56 years \nand above) was assessed in six pivotal studies. The immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for \nbooster vaccination (subjects 15 to 55 years of age) was assessed in one pivotal study.   \n \nPrimary immunogenicity analyses were conducted by measuring serum bactericidal activity (SBA) using \nhuman serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA). Rabbit complement (rSBA) data are \navailable in subsets in all age groups and generally follows the trends observed with human complement \n(hSBA) data. \n \nClinical data are not yet available on the persistence of antibody responses following primary vaccination \nwith MenQuadfi nor for booster vaccination in individuals primed with MenQuadfi. \n \nToddlers 12 to 23 month of age \nImmunogenicity in subjects 12 through 23 months of age was evaluated in two clinical studies (MET51 \n[NCT02955797] and MET57 [NCT03205371]). \n \nMET51 was conducted in subjects who were either meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve or had been primed with \nmonovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccines in their first year of life (see table 3). \nMET57 was conducted in meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve toddlers to assess the immunogenicity and safety \nof the concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with paediatric vaccines (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib \nor PCV-13). \n \nTable 3: Comparison of bactericidal antibody responses to MenQuadfi and MenACWY-TT vaccine \n30 days after vaccination of meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve subjects only or combined (na\u00efve + MenC \nprimed) subjects 12 through 23 months of age (study MET51*) \n \n\nEndpoint by \nSerogroup \n\nMenQuadfi \n(95% CI) \n\nNa\u00efve  \n\nMenACWY-TT  \n(95% CI) \n\nNa\u00efve  \n\nMenQuadfi \n(95% CI) \n\nCombined (Na\u00efve \n+ MenC Primed)  \n\nMenACWY-TT  \n(95% CI) \n\nCombined (Na\u00efve \n+ MenC Primed) \n\nA N=293 N=295 N=490 N=393-394 \n% \u22651:8 \n(Seroprotection)** \n\n90.8 \n(86.9; 93.8) \n\n89.5 \n(85.4; 92.7) \n\n90.4 \n(87.4; 92.9) \n\n91.6 \n(88.4; 94.2) \n\n% Seroresponse 76.8 \n(71.5; 81.5) \n\n72.5 \n(67.1; 77.6) \n\n76.5 \n(72.5; 80.2) \n\n77.1 \n(72.6; 81.2) \n\nhSBA GMT 28.7  \n(25.2; 32.6) \n\n28.0  \n(24.4; 32.1)  \n\n29.9 \n(26.9; 33.2) \n\n34.5 \n(30.5; 39.0) \n\nC N=293 N=295 N=489 N=393-394 \n% \u22651:8 \n(Seroprotection)** \n\n99.3 \n (97.6; 99.9) \n\n81.4 \n(76.4; 85.6) \n\n99.2 \n(97.9; 99.8) \n\n85.5 \n(81.7; 88.9) \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nEndpoint by \nSerogroup \n\nMenQuadfi \n(95% CI) \n\nNa\u00efve  \n\nMenACWY-TT  \n(95% CI) \n\nNa\u00efve  \n\nMenQuadfi \n(95% CI) \n\nCombined (Na\u00efve \n+ MenC Primed)  \n\nMenACWY-TT  \n(95% CI) \n\nCombined (Na\u00efve \n+ MenC Primed) \n\n% Seroresponse 98.3 \n(96.1; 99.4) \n\n71.5 \n(66.0; 76.6) \n\n97.1 \n(95.2; 98.4) \n\n77.4 \n(72.9; 81.4) \n\nhSBA GMT 436 \n(380; 500) \n\n26.4  \n(22.5; 31.0) \n\n880 \n(748; 1035) \n\n77.1 \n(60.7; 98.0) \n\nW N=293 N=296 N=489 N=393-394 \n% \u22651:8 \n(Seroprotection)** \n\n83.6 \n(78.9; 87.7) \n\n83.4 \n (78.7; 87.5) \n\n84.9 \n(81.4; 87.9) \n\n84.0 \n(80.0; 87.5) \n\n% Seroresponse 67.6  \n(61.9; 72.9) \n\n66.6  \n(60.9; 71.9) \n\n70.8 \n(66.5; 74.8) \n\n68.4 \n(63.6; 73.0) \n\nhSBA GMT 22.0 \n(18.9; 25.5) \n\n16.4 \n(14.4; 18.6) \n\n24.4 \n(21.8; 27.5) \n\n17.7 \n(15.8; 19.8) \n\nY N=293 N=296 N=488-490 N=394-395 \n% \u22651:8 \n(Seroprotection)** \n\n93.2 \n(89.7; 95.8) \n\n91.6 \n(87.8; 94.5) \n\n94.3 \n(91.8; 96.2) \n\n91.6 \n(88.5; 94.2) \n\n% Seroresponse 81.9 \n(77.0; 86.1) \n\n79.1  \n(74.0; 83.5) \n\n84.8 \n(81.3; 87.9) \n\n78.9 \n(74.6; 82.9) \n\nhSBA GMT 38.0 \n(33.0; 43.9) \n\n32.2 \n(28.0; 37.0) \n\n41.7 \n(37.5; 46.5) \n\n31.9 \n(28.4; 36.0) \n\n* Clinical trial identifier NCT02955797  \nN: number of subjects in the per-protocol analysis set with valid serology results. \n95% CI of the single proportion calculated from the exact binomial method. \n** Non-inferiority criterion met \n\n \nResponse in subjects previously vaccinated with MenC conjugate vaccines in their first year of life: \nThe majority of monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine primed toddlers (12-23 months of age) \nin study MET51 (NCT02955797) had hSBA titres \u22651:8 in the MenQuadfi group (N=198) (\u2265 86.7%) and \nin MenACWY-TT group (N=99) (\u2265 85.7%) at D30 post-vaccination. These toddlers received during their \ninfancy MenC-TT or MenC-CRM vaccines. Post-vaccination seroprotection rates were comparable \nbetween MenQuadfi and MenACWY-TT for all serogroups regardless of the priming background.  \n \nIn MenC-CRM primed subjects the GMTs for serogroup A were lower in the MenQuadfi group (n=49) \nthan in the MenACWY-TT group (n=25) [12.0 (8.23; 17.5) vs 42.2 (25.9; 68.8)]. After administration of \nMenquadfi seroprotection rates (hSBA titres \u22651:8) for subjects primed with MenC-CRM were lower but \nstill comparable for serogroups A, Y and W compared with those in the MenACWY-TT group [A: 68% \n(53.7; 81.3) vs 96.0% (79.6; 99.9)]; Y: 68.1% (52.9; 80.9) vs 80.0% (59.3; 93.2); W: 68.1% (52.9; 80.9) \nvs 79.2% (57.8; 92.9)]. The rates for serogroup C were comparable in both groups [95.8% (85.7; 99.5) vs \n92.0% (74.0; 99.0)]. The clinical relevance of these results is unknown. This aspect might/ be considered \nfor individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC-CRM vaccine in their first year of \nlife. \n \nMET57 (NCT03205371) was conducted in meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve toddlers 12 through 23 months \nof age to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with \npaediatric vaccines (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib or PCV-13). Overall, the post-vaccination hSBA \nseroprotection rates in subjects who received MenQuadfi was high for all serogroups (between 88.9% and \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n100%). Seroresponse and seroprotection rates for serogroup A were comparable when MenQuadfi was \nco-administered with PCV-13 and alone (56.1%, [95% CI 48.9; 63.2] and 83.7% [95% CI 77.7; 88.6] vs \n71.9% [95%CI 61.8; 80.6] and 90.6% [95%CI 82.9; 95.6]). There were differences in the hSBA GMTs \nfor serogroup A when MenQuadfi was co-administered with PCV-13 (n=196) compared with MenQuadfi \nadministered alone (n=96) (24.6 [95%CI 20.2; 30.1] and 49.0 [95%CI 36.8; 65.3]).)

What MenQuadfi  is and what it is used for \n \nWhat MenQuadfi is used for \nMenQuadfi  is a vaccine that can be given to children from 1 year of age, adolescents and adults.  \n \nMenQuadfi helps to protect against infections caused by a type of bacteria (germs) called \u201cNeisseria \nmeningitidis\u201d, specifically against types A, C, W and Y.  \n \nNeisseria meningitidis bacteria (also called meningococci) can be passed from person to person and can \ncause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections, such as:  \n\u2022 Meningitis \u2013 an inflammation of the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord; \n\u2022 Septicaemia \u2013 an infection of the blood.  \nBoth infections can result in serious disease with long lasting effects or possibly death.  \n \nMenQuadfi should be used in accordance with official national guidelines. \n \nHow the vaccine works \nMenQuadfi works by stimulating the vaccinated person natural defense (immune system), to produce \nprotective antibodies against the bacteria. \n \nMenQuadfi only helps to protect against illnesses caused by Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W and Y.  \n\u2022 It does not protect against infections caused by other types of Neisseria meningitidis. \n\u2022 It does not protect against meningitis or septicaemia caused by other bacteria or viruses.  \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \nAs with any vaccine, MenQuadfi may not fully protect all the people who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2.
