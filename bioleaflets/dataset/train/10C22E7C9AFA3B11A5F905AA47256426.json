NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna dispersion for injection \nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nThis is a multidose vial which contains 10 doses of 0.5 mL. \n \nOne dose (0.5 mL) contains 100 micrograms of messenger RNA (mRNA) (embedded in SM-102 lipid \nnanoparticles).  \n \nSingle-stranded, 5\u2019-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription \nfrom the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersion for injection \nWhite to off white dispersion (pH: 7.0 \u2013 8.0). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by \nSARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIndividuals 18 years of age and older \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is administered as a course of 2 doses (0.5 mL each). It is recommended \nto administer the second dose 28 days after the first dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nThere are no data available on the interchangeability of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna with other \nCOVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination course. Individuals who have received the first dose \nof COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna should receive the second dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna to \ncomplete the vaccination course.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in children and adolescents less than 18 years \nof age have not yet been established. No data are available.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nElderly population \nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals \u226565 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nThe vaccine should be administered intramuscularly. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the \nupper arm.  \n \nDo not administer this vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  \n \nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. \n \nFor precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. \n \nFor instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity and anaphylaxis \n \nAnaphylaxis has been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine.  \n \nClose observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. The second dose of \nthe vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. \n \nAnxiety-related reactions \n \nAnxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress\u2010related \nreactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. \nIt is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n \nConcurrent illness \n \nVaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute \ninfection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \n \nAs with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals \nreceiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as \nhaemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in \nthese individuals. \n \nImmunocompromised individuals \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised \nindividuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COVID-19 \nVaccine Moderna may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. \n \nDuration of protection \n \nThe duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by \nongoing clinical trials. \n \nLimitations of vaccine effectiveness \n \nIndividuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, \nvaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may not protect all vaccine recipients.  \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nSodium  \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say, essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \nConcomitant administration of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna with other vaccines has not been studied.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is limited experience with use of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of COVID-19 \nVaccine Moderna in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any \npotential risks for the mother and foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is excreted in human milk.  \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHowever, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351 \nparticipants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna \n\n\n\n6 \n\n(n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the \npopulation was 52 years (range 18-95); 22,831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and \n7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 65 years of age and older. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), \nheadache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), \naxillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness \n(10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days \nafter vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.  \n  \nOverall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence \nof axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting \nand fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. \nLocal and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n  \nThe safety profile presented below is based on data generated in a placebo- controlled clinical \nstudy on 30,351 adults \u2265 18 years of age. \n  \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency convention:  \n  \nVery common (\u22651/10)  \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10)  \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100)  \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000)  \nVery rare (<1/10,000)  \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n  \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n  \nMedDRA System Organ Class  Frequency  Adverse reactions  \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders  \n\nVery common  Lymphadenopathy*  \n\nImmune system disorders Not known  Anaphylaxis  \nHypersensitivity \n\nNervous system disorders  Very common  Headache \nRare Acute peripheral facial \n\nparalysis** \nGastrointestinal disorders  Very common  Nausea/vomiting \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders  \n\nCommon\u202f  Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders  \n\nVery common  Myalgia \nArthralgia \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration site conditions  \n\nVery common  Injection site pain \nFatigue \nChills \nPyrexia \nInjection site swelling  \n\nCommon  Injection site erythema, \nInjection site urticaria, \nInjection site rash \n\nUncommon Injection site pruritus \nRare Facial swelling*** \n\n*Lymphadenopathy was captured as axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side as the injection site.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n**Throughout the safety follow-up period, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by\u202fthree\u202fparticipants in the \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna group\u202fand one participant in the placebo group. Onset\u202fin the vaccine group \nparticipants\u202fwas\u202f22\u202fdays,\u202f28\u202fdays, and\u202f32 days after Dose 2.  \n***There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of \ndermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination  \n \nThe reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, that \nwere seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for \nSARS-CoV-2 at baseline.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \nIn the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is \nrecommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03 \n \nMechanism of action \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna contains mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA \nencodes for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the \nheptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. After \nintramuscular injection, cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid \nnanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. \nThe delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is non-\nreplicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. \nThe expressed, membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognised by immune cells as \na foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and B-cell responses to generate neutralising antibodies, \nwhich may contribute to protection against COVID-19. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 3 clinical study (NCT04470427) excluded \nindividuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 6 months, as \nwell as participants who were pregnant, or with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nParticipants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza vaccines could be administered 14 \ndays before or 14 days after any dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Participants were also required \nto observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins \nprior to the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. \n \nA total of 30,351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development \nof COVID-19 disease.  \n \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included \n28,207 subjects who received either COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073) \nand had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, \n52.6% male, 79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nparticipants identified as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). \nA dosing window of \u20137 to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was \nallowed for inclusion in the PPS.  98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 \ndays after dose 1 (corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days). \n \nCOVID-19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) and \nby a Clinical Adjudication Committee. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented \nin Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Vaccine Efficacy Analysis: confirmed COVID-19# regardless of severity starting 14 days \nafter the 2nd dose \u2013 Per-Protocol Set  \n \n\nAge Group \n(Years) \n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna Placebo  \n\nSubjects \nN \n\nCOVID-\n19 Cases \n\nn \n\nIncidence Rate \nof COVID-19 per \n\n1,000 Person-\nYears \n\nSubjects \nN \n\nCOVID-19 \nCases \n\nn \n\nIncidence Rate \nof COVID-19 \n\nper 1,000 \nPerson-Years \n\n% Vaccine \nEfficacy (95% \n\nCI)* \n\nOverall \n(\u226518) \n\n14,134 11 3.328 14,073 185 56.510 94.1 \n(89.3, 96.8)** \n\n18 to <65 10,551 7 2.875 10,521 156 64.625 95.6 \n(90.6, 97.9) \n\n\u226565 3,583 4 4.595 3,552 29 33.728 86.4 \n(61.4, 95.2) \n\n\u226565 to <75 2,953 4 5.586 2,864 22 31.744 82.4% \n(48.9, 93.9) \n\n\u226575 630 0 0 688 7 41.968 100% \n(NE, 100)  \n\n#COVID-19: symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 2 systemic symptoms or 1 \nrespiratory symptom.

Multiplicity adjusted statistical analyses were carried out in an interim \nanalysis based on less COVID-19 cases, not reported here. \n \nAmong all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group \ncompared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group. Of the 30 participants with severe \ndisease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the \nremaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (\u2264 93% \non room air).  \n \nThe vaccine efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna to prevent COVID-19, regardless of prior \nSARS-CoV-2 infection (determined by baseline serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) \nfrom 14 days after Dose 2 was 93.6% (95% confidence interval 88.5, 96.4%).  \n \nAdditionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point \nestimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with \nhigh risk of severe COVID-19. \n \nElderly population  \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older, including 3,768 \nsubjects 65 years of age and older. The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was consistent \nbetween elderly (\u226565 years) and younger adult subjects (18-64 years).  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of \nCOVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nConditional Approval \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \nwill review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be \nupdated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose \ntoxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. \n \nGeneral Toxicity: \nGeneral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the \nhuman dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and \ntransient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated \npartial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to \nhumans is low. \n \nGenotoxicity/Carcinogenicity: \nIn vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM-102 of \nthe vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies \nwere not performed. \n \nReproductive Toxicity: \nIn a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of \nmRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of COVID-19 \nVaccine Moderna was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 \nand 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were \npresent in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as \nin foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, \nembryo foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of mRNA-\n1273 vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is and what it is used for \n \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 . It is \ngiven to adults aged 18 years and older. The active substance in COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is \nmRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid \nnanoparticles. \n \nAs COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID-19. \n \nHow the vaccine works  \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna stimulates the body\u2019s natural defences (immune system). The vaccine \nworks by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19. \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry \ninstructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells \nthen make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you \nagainst COVID-19.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna \n \nThe vaccine must not be given if  \n- you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna if:  \n- you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine \n\ninjection or after you were given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in the past.  \n- you have a very weak or compromised immune system \n- you have ever fainted following any needle injection. \n- you have a bleeding disorder  \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n- you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a \nmild fever or upper airway infection like a cold \n\n- you have any serious illness  \n- if you have anxiety related to injections \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. \n \nAs with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may not fully \nprotect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected\u2019 \n \nChildren and adolescents \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is not recommended for children aged under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may affect the way other medicines work, and other \nmedicines may affect how COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna works. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell \nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse before being vaccinated.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the \nvaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  \n \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna contains sodium \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose and, that is to say, \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How you will be given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna \n \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Moderna will be given to you as two 0.5 mL injections. It is recommended to \nadminister the second dose of the same vaccine 28 days after the first dose to complete the vaccination \ncourse. \n \nYour doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in your \nupper arm. \n \nDuring and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you \nfor around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. \n \nIf you miss an appointment for your 2nd dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna \n- If you miss an appointment, arrange another visit as soon as possible with you doctor, nurse, or \n\npharmacist. \n- If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected against COVID-19. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nGet urgent medical attention if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of an allergic \nreaction:  \n\n- feeling faint or light-headed; \n- changes in your heartbeat; \n- shortness of breath; \n- wheezing; \n- swelling of your lips, face, or throat; \n- hives or rash; \n- nausea or vomiting; \n- stomach pain. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you develop any other side effects.
