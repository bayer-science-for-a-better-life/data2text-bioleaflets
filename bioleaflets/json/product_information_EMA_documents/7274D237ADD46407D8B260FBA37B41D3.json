QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nHemlibra 30 mg/mL solution for injection \n \nEach mL of solution contains 30 mg of emicizumab* \n \nEach vial of 1 mL contains 30 mg of emicizumab at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. \n \nHemlibra 150 mg/mL solution for injection \n \nEach mL of solution contains 150 mg of emicizumab* \n \nEach vial of 0.4 mL contains 60 mg of emicizumab at a concentration of 150 mg/mL. \n \nEach vial of 0.7 mL contains 105 mg of emicizumab at a concentration of 150 mg/mL. \n \nEach vial of 1 mL contains 150 mg of emicizumab at a concentration of 150 mg/mL. \n \n* Emicizumab is a humanised monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody produced \nusing recombinant DNA technology in mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nColourless to slightly yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHemlibra is indicated for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with  \n● haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors \n● severe haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII < 1%) without factor VIII \n\ninhibitors.  \n \nHemlibra can be used in all age groups. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and/or bleeding disorders. \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment (including routine prophylaxis) with bypassing agents (e.g. aPCC and rFVIIa) should be \ndiscontinued the day before starting Hemlibra therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nFactor VIII (FVIII) prophylaxis may be continued for the first 7 days of Hemlibra treatment. \n \nThe recommended dose is 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks (loading dose), followed by \nmaintenance dose of either 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 6 mg/kg every four \nweeks , all doses administered as a subcutaneous injection. \n \nThe loading dose regimen is the same, irrespective of the maintenance dose regimen. \n \nThe maintenance dose regimen should be selected based on physician and patient/caregiver dosing \nregimen preference to support adherence. \n \nThe patient dose (in mg) and volume (in mL) should be calculated as follows: \n \n● Loading dose (3 mg/kg) once weekly for the first 4 weeks:  \n\nPatient bodyweight (kg) x dose (3 mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of emicizumab to be \nadministered \n\n● Followed by a maintenance dose of either 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks or \n6 mg/kg every four weeks,  from week 5 on:  \nPatient bodyweight (kg) x dose (1.5; 3 or 6 mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of emicizumab to be \nadministered \n\n \nThe total volume of Hemlibra to be injected subcutaneously is calculated as follows: \nTotal amount (mg) of emicizumab to be administered ÷ vial concentration (mg/mL) = total volume of \nHemlibra (mL) to be injected. \n \nDifferent Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in the same \nsyringe when making up the total volume to be administered. \n \nA volume greater than 2 mL per injection should not be administered. \n \nExamples:  \n \nPatient’s bodyweight of 16 kg, under a maintenance dose regimen of 1.5 mg/kg once weekly: \n● Loading dose (first 4 weeks) example: 16 kg x 3 mg/kg = 48 mg of emicizumab needed for the \n\nloading dose. \n● To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 48 mg by 150 mg/mL: 48 mg \n\nof emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 0.32 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be injected. \n● Choose appropriate dosage and volume from vial strengths available. \n \n● Maintenance dose (from week 5 on) example: 16 kg x 1.5 mg/kg = 24 mg of emicizumab \n\nneeded for the maintenance dose. \n● To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 24 mg by 30 mg/mL: 24 mg \n\nof emicizumab ÷ 30 mg/mL = 0.8 mL of 30 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be injected once \nweekly. \n\n● Choose appropriate dosage and volume from vial strength available.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nPatient’s bodyweight of 40 kg, under a maintenance dose regimen of 3 mg/kg every two weeks: \n● Loading dose (first 4 weeks) example: 40 kg x 3 mg/kg = 120 mg of emicizumab needed for the \n\nloading dose. \n● To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 120 mg by 150 mg/mL: \n\n120 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 0.8 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be \ninjected. \n\n● Choose appropriate dosage and volume from vial strengths available. \n \n● Maintenance dose (from week 5 on) example: 40 kg x 3 mg/kg = 120 mg of emicizumab needed \n\nfor the maintenance dose. \n● To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 120 mg by 150 mg/mL: \n\n120 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 0.8 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be \ninjected every two weeks. \n\n● Choose appropriate dosage and volume from vial strength available.  \n \nPatient’s bodyweight of 60 kg, under a maintenance dose regimen of 6 mg/kg every four weeks: \n● Loading dose (first 4 weeks) example: 60 kg x 3 mg/kg = 180 mg of emicizumab needed for the \n\nloading dose. \n● To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 180 mg by 150 mg/mL: \n\n180 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 1.20 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be \ninjected. \n\n● Choose appropriate dosage and volume from vial strengths available.  \n \n● Maintenance dose (from week 5 on) example: 60 kg x 6 mg/kg = 360 mg of emicizumab needed \n\nfor the maintenance dose. \n● To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 360 mg by 150 mg/mL: \n\n360 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 2.4 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be \ninjected every four weeks. \n\n● Choose appropriate dosage and volume from vial strengths available. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nHemlibra is intended for long-term prophylactic treatment.  \n \nDosage adjustments during treatment  \n \nNo dosage adjustments of Hemlibra are recommended. \n \nDelayed or missed doses  \n \nIf a patient misses a scheduled subcutaneous injection of Hemlibra, the patient should be instructed to \ntake the missed dose as soon as possible, up to a day before the day of the next scheduled dose. The \npatient should then administer the next dose on the usual scheduled dosing day. The patient should not \ntake two doses on the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric  \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended in paediatric patients (see section 5.2). There are no data in \npatients less than 1 year of age. \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).   There \nare no data in patients over 77 years old. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended in patients with mild , renal or hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). There are limited data available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with moderate renal or \nhepatic impairment.  Emicizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal or hepatic \nimpairment \n \nManagement in the perioperative setting \n \nThe safety and efficacy of emicizumab have not been formally evaluated in the surgical setting. \nPatients have had surgical procedures without discontinuing emicizumab prophylaxis in clinical trials.  \n \nIf bypassing agents (e.g. aPCC and rFVIIa) are required in the perioperative period, please refer to the \ndosing guidance on the use of bypassing agents in section 4.4. \nIf FVIII is required in the perioperative period, please refer to section 4.5. \n \nWhen monitoring a patients underlying hemostatic activity, please refer to section 4.4 for laboratory \ntests unaffected by emicizumab. \n \nImmune tolerance induction (ITI) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of emicizumab in patients receiving ongoing immune tolerance induction have \nnot yet been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHemlibra is for subcutaneous use only, and it should be administered using appropriate aseptic \ntechnique (see section 6.6). \n \nThe injection should be restricted to the recommended injection sites: the abdomen, the upper outer \narms and the thighs (see section 5.2).  \n \nAdministration of Hemlibra subcutaneous injection in the upper outer arm should be performed by a \ncaregiver or healthcare professional. \n \nAlternating the site of injection may help prevent or reduce injection site reactions (see section 4.8). \nHemlibra subcutaneous injection should not be administered into areas where the skin is red, bruised, \ntender or hard, or areas where there are moles or scars.  \n \nDuring treatment with Hemlibra, other medicinal products for subcutaneous administration should, \npreferably, be injected at different anatomical sites. \n \nAdministration by the patient and/or caregiver \n \nHemlibra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional. After proper training in \nsubcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject Hemlibra, or the patient’s caregiver may \nadminister it, if their physician determines that it is appropriate.  \n \nThe physician and the caregiver should determine the appropriateness of the child self-injecting \nHemlibra. However, self-administration is not recommended for children below 7 years of age. \n \nFor comprehensive instructions on the administration of Hemlibra, see section 6.6 and package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability  \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy associated with Hemlibra and activated prothrombin complex \nconcentrate \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were reported from a clinical trial in patients receiving \nHemlibra prophylaxis when on average a cumulative amount of  >100U/kg/24 hours of activated \nprothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) for 24 hours or more was administered (see section 4.8). \nTreatment for the TMA events included supportive care with or without plasmapheresis and \nhaemodialysis. Evidence of improvement was seen within one week following discontinuation of \naPCC and interruption of Hemlibra. This rapid improvement is distinct from the usual clinical course \nobserved in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and classic TMAs, such as thrombotic \nthrombocytopenic purpura (see section 4.8). One patient resumed Hemlibra following resolution of \nTMA and continued to be treated safely. \n \nPatients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis should be monitored for the development of TMA when \nadministering aPCC. The physician should immediately discontinue aPCC and interrupt Hemlibra \ntherapy if clinical symptoms and/or laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as \nclinically indicated. Physicians and patients/caregivers should weigh the benefits and risks of \nresuming Hemlibra prophylaxis following complete resolution of TMA on a case-by-case basis. In \ncase a bypassing agent is indicated in a patient receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, see below for dosing \nguidance on the use of bypassing agents. \n \nCaution should be used when treating patients who are at high risk for TMA (e.g. have a previous \nmedical history or family history of TMA), or those who are receiving concomitant medications \nknown to be a risk factor for the development of TMA (e.g. ciclosporin, quinine, tacrolimus). \n \nThromboembolism associated with Hemlibra and activated prothrombin complex concentrate  \n \nSerious thrombotic events were reported from a clinical trial in patients receiving Hemlibra \nprophylaxis when on average a cumulative amount of >100U/kg/24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or \nmore was administered (see section 4.8). No cases required anticoagulation therapy. Following \ndiscontinuation of aPCC and interruption of Hemlibra, evidence of improvement or resolution was \nseen within one month (see section 4.8). One patient resumed Hemlibra following resolution of \nthrombotic event and continued to be treated safely.  \n \nPatients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis should be monitored for the development of \nthromboembolism when administering aPCC. The physician should immediately discontinue aPCC \nand interrupt Hemlibra therapy if clinical symptoms, imaging, and/or laboratory findings consistent \nwith thrombotic events occur, and manage as clinically indicated. Physicians and patients/caregivers \nshould weigh the benefits and risks of resuming Hemlibra prophylaxis following complete resolution \nof thrombotic events on a case-by-case basis. In case a bypassing agent is indicated in a patient \nreceiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, see below for dosing guidance on the use of bypassing agents. \n \nGuidance on the use of bypassing agents in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis \n \nTreatment with bypassing agents should be discontinued the day before starting Hemlibra therapy. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \nPhysicians should discuss with all patients and/or caregivers the exact dose and schedule of bypassing \nagents to use, if required while receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. \n \nHemlibra increases the patient’s coagulation potential. The bypassing agent dose required may \ntherefore be lower than that used without Hemlibra prophylaxis. The dose and duration of treatment \nwith bypassing agents will depend on the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient’s clinical \ncondition. Use of aPCC should be avoided unless no other treatment options/alternatives are available. \nIf aPCC is indicated in a patient receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, the initial dose should not exceed \n50 U/kg and laboratory monitoring is recommended (including but not restricted to renal monitoring, \nplatelet testing, and evaluation of thrombosis). If bleeding is not controlled with the initial dose of \naPCC up to 50 U/kg, additional aPCC doses should be administered under medical guidance or \nsupervision with consideration made to laboratory monitoring for the diagnosis of TMA or \nthromboembolism and verification of bleeds prior to repeated dosing. The total aPCC dose should not \nexceed 100 U/kg in the first 24-hours of treatment. Treating physicians must carefully weigh the risk \nof TMA and thromboembolism against the risk of bleeding when considering aPCC treatment beyond \na maximum of 100 U/kg in the first 24-hours. \n \nIn clinical trials, no cases of TMA or thrombotic events were observed with use of activated \nrecombinant human FVII (rFVIIa) alone in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. \n \nBypassing agent dosing guidance should be followed for at least 6 months following discontinuation \nof Hemlibra prophylaxis (see section 5.2). \n \nEffects of emicizumab on coagulation tests \n \nEmicizumab restores the tenase cofactor activity of missing activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). \nCoagulation laboratory tests based on intrinsic clotting, including the activated clotting time (ACT), \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (e.g. aPTT), measure the total clotting time including time \nneeded for activation of FVIII to FVIIIa by thrombin. Such intrinsic pathway based tests will yield \noverly shortened clotting times with emicizumab, which does not require activation by thrombin. The \noverly shortened intrinsic clotting time will then disturb all single factor assays based on aPTT, such \nas the one stage FVIII activity assay (see section 4.4, Table 1). However, single factor assays utilising \nchromogenic or immuno-based methods are not affected by emicizumab and may be used to monitor \ncoagulation parameters during treatment, with specific considerations for FVIII chromogenic activity \nassays as described below. \n \nChromogenic factor VIII activity tests may be manufactured with either human or bovine coagulation \nproteins. Assays containing human coagulation factors are responsive to emicizumab but may \noverestimate the clinical haemostatic potential of emicizumab. In contrast, assays containing bovine \ncoagulation factors are insensitive to emicizumab (no activity measured) and can be used to monitor \nendogenous or infused factor VIII activity, or to measure anti FVIII inhibitors. \n \nEmicizumab remains active in the presence of inhibitors against factor VIII and so will produce a false \nnegative result in clotting based Bethesda assays for functional inhibition of factor VIII. Instead, a \nchromogenic Bethesda assay utilising a bovine based factor VIII chromogenic test that is insensitive to \nemicizumab may be used. \n \nThese two pharmacodynamic markers do not reflect the true haemostatic effect of emicizumab in vivo \n(aPTT is overly shortened and reported factor VIII activity may be overestimated) but provide a \nrelative indication of the pro-coagulant effect of emicizumab. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nIn summary, intrinsic pathway clotting-based laboratory test results in patients treated with Hemlibra \nshould not be used to monitor its activity, determine dosing for factor replacement or anti-coagulation, \nor measure factor VIII inhibitors titers. Caution should be taken if intrinsic pathway clotting based \nlaboratory tests are used, as misinterpretation of their results may lead to under-treatment of patients \nexperiencing bleeding episodes, which can potentially result in severe or life-threatening bleeds.  \n \nLaboratory tests affected and unaffected by emicizumab are shown in Table 1 below. Due to its long \nhalf-life, these effects on coagulation assays may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nTable 1 Coagulation test results affected and unaffected by emicizumab \n \n\nResults Affected by emicizumab Results Unaffected by emicizumab \n\n- Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) \n- Bethesda assays (clotting-based) for FVIII \ninhibitor titers  \n- One-stage, aPTT-based, single-factor assays \n- aPTT-based activated protein C resistance \n(APC-R) \n- Activated clotting time (ACT) \n\n- Bethesda assays (bovine chromogenic) for FVIII \ninhibitor titers \n- Thrombin time (TT) \n- One-stage, prothrombin time (PT)-based, \nsingle-factor assays \n- Chromogenic-based single-factor assays other \nthan FVIII1 \n- Immuno-based assays (e.g. ELISA, \nturbidimetric methods) \n- Genetic tests of coagulation factors (e.g. Factor \nV Leiden, Prothrombin 20210) \n\n1For important considerations regarding FVIII chromogenic activity assays, see section 4.4. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere are no data in children < 1 year of age. The developing hemostatic system in neonates and \ninfants is dynamic and evolving, and the relative concentrations of pro- and anticoagulant proteins in \nthese patients should be taken into consideration when making a benefit-risk assessment, including \npotential risk of thrombosis (e.g. central venous catheter-related thrombosis). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo adequate or well-controlled drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with emicizumab.  \n \nClinical experience indicates a drug interaction exists with emicizumab and aPCC (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8).  \n \nThere is a possibility for hypercoagulability with rFVIIa or FVIII with emicizumab based on \npreclinical experiments. Emicizumab increases coagulation potential, therefore the FVIIa or FVIII \ndose required to achieve hemostasis may be lower than when used without Hemlibra prophylaxis. \n \nIn case of thrombotic complication, the physician should consider  discontinuing rFVIIa or FVIII and \ninterrupt Hemlibra prophylaxis as clinically indicated. Further management should be tailored to the \nindividual clinical circumstances. \n● Decision about dose modifications should take into account the half-life of medications; \n\nspecifically, interruption of emicizumab may not have an immediate effect. \n● Monitoring using a FVIII chromogenic assay may guide the administration of coagulation \n\nfactors, and testing for thrombophilic traits may be considered. \n \nExperience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics with aPCC or rFVIIa in patients \nreceiving Hemlibra prophylaxis is limited. However, the possibility of thrombotic events should be \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nconsidered when systemic anti-fibrinolytics are used in combination with aPCC or rFVIIa in patients \nreceiving emicizumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential receiving Hemlibra should use effective contraception during, and \nfor at least 6 months after cessation of Hemlibra treatment (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no clinical studies of emicizumab use in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have \nnot been conducted with Hemlibra. It is not known whether emicizumab can cause fetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Hemlibra should be used \nduring pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus \ntaking into account that, during pregnancy and after parturition, the risk for thrombosis is increased \nand that several pregnancy complications are linked to an increased risk for disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation (DIC). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether emicizumab is excreted in human milk. No studies have been conducted to \nassess the impact of emicizumab on milk production or its presence in breast milk. Human IgG is \nknown to be present in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or \nto discontinue/abstain from Hemlibra therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). No fertility data are available in humans. Thus, the effect of emicizumab on male \nand female fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHemlibra has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported from the clinical trials with Hemlibra were \nthrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and thrombotic events, including cavernous sinus thrombosis \n(CST) and superficial vein thrombosis contemporaneous with skin necrosis (see below and \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe most common ADRs reported in ≥ 10% of patients treated with at least one dose of Hemlibra \nwere: injection site reactions (20 %), arthralgia (15 %) and headache (14 %). \n \nIn total three patients (0.8 %) in the clinical trials receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis withdrew from \ntreatment due to ADRs, which were TMA, skin necrosis contemporaneous with superficial \nthrombophlebitis, and headache.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions  \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are based on pooled data from four phase III clinical \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\ntrials (adult and adolescent studies [BH29884 - HAVEN 1, BH30071 – HAVEN 3, and BO39182 – \nHAVEN 4] and a paediatric study BH29992 - HAVEN 2]), in which a total of 373 male patients with \nhaemophilia A received at least one dose of Hemlibra as routine prophylaxis. Two hundred and sixty-\nsix (71 %) were adults, 47(13 %) were adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years), 55 (15 %) were children (≥ 2 \nto < 12 years) and five (1 %) were infants and toddlers (1 month to < 2 years). The median duration of \nexposure across the studies was 33 weeks (range: 0.1 to 94.3 weeks).  \n \nADRs from the phase III clinical trials in patients who received Hemlibra are listed by MedDRA \nsystem organ class (Table 2). The corresponding frequency categories for each ADR are based on the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).  \n \nTable 2 Summary of adverse drug reactions from pooled HAVEN clinical trials with \n\nHemlibra  \n \nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Adverse reactions \n\n(preferred term, MedDRA) \nFrequency \n\n   \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombotic microangiopathy Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Very common \n\nVascular disorders Thrombophlebitis superficial Uncommon \n\n*Cavernous sinus thrombosis Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea  Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Skin necrosis Uncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nArthralgia Very common \n\nMyalgia Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site reaction Very common \n\nPyrexia Common \n*Vascular disorders is a secondary SOC for cavernous sinus thrombosis. \nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy \n \nIn pooled phase III clinical trials, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) events were reported in less \nthan 1 % of patients (3/373) and in 9.7 % of patients (3/31) who received at least one dose of aPCC \nwhile being treated with emicizumab. All 3 TMAs occurred when on average a cumulative amount \nof > 100 U/Kg/24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or more was administered during a treatment event (see \nsection 4.4). Patients presented with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute \nkidney injury, without severe deficiencies in ADAMTS13 activity. One patient resumed Hemlibra \nfollowing resolution of TMA without recurrence. \n \nThrombotic events \n \nIn pooled phase III clinical trials, serious thrombotic events were reported in less than 1 % of patients \n(2/373) and in 6.5 % of patients (2/31) who received at least one dose of aPCC while being treated \nwith emicizumab. Both serious thrombotic events occurred when on average a cumulative amount \nof > 100 U/Kg/24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or more was administered during a treatment event. One \npatient resumed Hemlibra following resolution of the thrombotic event without recurrence (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nCharacterization of the interaction between emicizumab and aPCC treatment in pivotal clinical trials  \n \nThere were 82 instances of aPCC treatment* in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, of which \neight instances (10%) consisted of on average a cumulative amount of >100 U/kg/24 hours of aPCC \nfor 24 hours or more; two of the eight instances were associated with thrombotic events and three of \nthe eight instances were associated with TMA (Table 3). No TMA or thrombotic events were \nassociated with the remaining instances of aPCC treatment. Of all instances of aPCC treatment, 68 % \nconsisted of only one infusion < 100 U/kg. \n \nTable 3 Characterisation of aPCC treatment* in the pooled phase III clinical studies  \n \n\nDuration of aPCC \ntreatment  \n\nAverage cumulative amount of aPCC over 24 hours \n(U/kg/24 hours) \n\n<50 50–100 >100 \n\n<24 hours 9 47 13 \n24-48 hours 0 3 1b \n>48 hours 1 1 7a,a,a,b \n\n \n\n* An instance of aPCC treatment is defined as all doses of aPCC received by a patient, for any reason, until there \nwas a 36-hour treatment-free break. Includes all instances of aPCC treatment excluding those in the first 7 days \nand those that occurred 30 days after the discontinuation of Hemlibra. \na Thrombotic microangiopathy \nb Thrombotic event \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site reactions (ISRs) were reported very commonly (20 %) from clinical trials. All ISRs \nobserved in the Hemlibra clinical trials were reported as being non-serious and mild to moderate in \nintensity, and 95 % resolved without treatment. The most commonly reported ISR symptoms were \ninjection site erythema (11  %), injection site pain (4 %) and injection site pruritus (3 %). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe paediatric population studied comprises a total of 107 patients, of which 5 (5 %) were infants and \ntoddlers (1 month to less than 2 years of age), 55 (51 %) were children (from 2 to less than 12 years of \nage) and 47 (44 %) were adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years old). \nThe safety profile of Hemlibra was overall consistent between infants, children, adolescents, and \nadults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose   \n \nThere is limited experience with overdose of Hemlibra. \n \nSymptoms \n \nAccidental overdose may result in hypercoagulability.  \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n12 \n \n\nManagement \n \nPatients who receive an accidental overdose should immediately contact their physician and be \nmonitored closely.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics; ATC code: B02BX06 \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nEmicizumab is a humanized monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody with a \nbispecific antibody structure. \n \nEmicizumab bridges activated factor IX and factor X to restore the function of missing activated factor \nVIII that is needed for effective haemostasis. \n \nEmicizumab has no structural relationship or sequence homology to factor VIII and, as such, does not \ninduce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to factor VIII. \n \nPharmacodynamics \n \nProphylactic therapy with Hemlibra shortens the aPTT and increases the reported factor VIII activity \n(using a chromogenic assay with human coagulation factors). These two pharmacodynamic markers \ndo not reflect the true haemostatic effect of emicizumab in vivo (aPTT is overly shortened and \nreported factor VIII activity may be overestimated) but provide a relative indication of the pro-\ncoagulant effect of emicizumab. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A with or without FVIII \ninhibitors was evaluated in four clinical studies (three adult and adolescent studies [HAVEN 3, \nHAVEN 1, and HAVEN 4] and a paediatric study [HAVEN 2]). \n \nClinical studies in adults and adolescents \n \nPatients (aged ≥ 12 years old and > 40 kg) with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors (Study \nBH30071 – HAVEN 3) \n \nThe HAVEN 3 study was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase III clinical study in 152 adult \nand adolescent males (aged ≥ 12 years and > 40 kg) with severe hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors \nwho previously received either episodic (“on demand”) or prophylactic treatment with FVIII.  Patients \nreceived subcutaneous Hemlibra, 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks followed by either \n1.5 mg/kg once weekly (Arms A and D) or 3 mg/kg every two weeks (Arm B) thereafter, or no \nprophylaxis (Arm C).  Patients in Arm C could switch to Hemlibra (3 mg/kg every two weeks) after \ncompleting at least 24 weeks without prophylaxis.  For Arms A and B dose up-titration to 3 mg/kg \nweekly was allowed after 24 weeks for patients who experienced two or more qualified bleeds (i.e., \nspontaneous and clinically significant bleeds occurring at steady state).  Arm D patients could up-\ntitrate after the second qualifying bleed.  At the time of the primary analysis, five patients underwent \nup-titration of their maintenance dose. \n \nEighty-nine patients previously treated with episodic (“on demand”) FVIII were randomized in a 2:2:1 \nratio to receive Hemlibra either once weekly (Arm A; N = 36), every two weeks (Arm B; N = 35) or \nno prophylaxis (Arm C; N = 18), with stratification by prior 24-week bleed rate (< 9 or ≥ 9).  Sixty-\n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nthree patients previously treated with prophylactic FVIII were enrolled into Arm D to receive \nHemlibra (1.5 mg/kg once weekly). \n \nThe primary objective of the study was to evaluate in patients previously treated with episodic FVIII \nthe efficacy of prophylactic Hemlibra weekly (Arm A) or every two weeks (Arm B) compared to no \nprophylaxis (Arm C) based on the number of bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors (see \nTable 4).  Other objectives of the study included evaluation of the randomized comparison of Arms A \nor B and Arm C for the efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis in reducing the number of all bleeds, \nspontaneous bleeds, joint bleeds, and target joint bleeds (see Table 4), as well as assessing patient \ntreatment preference using a preference survey. \n \nThe efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis was also compared with previous prophylactic FVIII treatment \n(Arm D) in patients who had participated in a non-interventional study (NIS) prior to enrollment (see \nTable 5).  Only patients from the NIS were included in this comparison, because bleed and treatment \ndata were collected with the same level of granularity as used in HAVEN 3. \nThe NIS is an observational study with the main objective of capturing detailed clinical data on the \nbleeding episodes and haemophilia medication use of patients with haemophilia A outside of an \ninterventional trial setting. \n \nPatients (aged ≥ 12 years old) with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors (Study BH29884 – \nHAVEN 1) \n \nIn the HAVEN 1 study a randomised, multicentre, open-label clinical study in 109 adolescent and \nadult males (aged  ≥  12 years old) with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors who had previously \nreceived either episodic or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents (aPCC and rFVIIa). In the \nstudy, patients received weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis (Arms A, C, and D) — 3 mg/kg once weekly \nfor four weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly thereafter — or no prophylaxis (Arm B). Patients \nrandomized to Arm B could switch to Hemlibra prophylaxis after completing at least 24 weeks \nwithout prophylaxis. Dose up-titration to 3 mg/kg once weekly was allowed after 24 weeks on \nHemlibra prophylaxis for patients who experienced two or more qualified bleeds (i.e.  spontaneous \nand verified clinically significant bleeds occurring at steady state).  At the time of the primary \nanalysis, two patients underwent up-titration of their maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg once weekly.  \n \nFifty-three patients previously treated with episodic (“on-demand”) bypassing agents were randomised \nin a 2:1 ratio to receive Hemlibra prophylaxis (Arm A) or no prophylaxis (Arm B), with stratification \nby prior 24-week bleed rate (< 9 or ≥ 9). \n \nForty-nine patients previously treated with prophylactic bypassing agents were enrolled in Arm C to \nreceive Hemlibra prophylaxis.  Seven patients previously treated with episodic (“on-demand”) \nbypassing agents who had participated in the NIS prior to enrolment but were unable to enroll in \nHAVEN 1 prior to the closure of Arms A and B were enrolled in Arm D to receive Hemlibra \nprophylaxis.  \n \nThe primary objective of the study was to evaluate, among patients previously treated with episodic \n(“on-demand”) bypassing agents, the treatment effect of weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis compared with \nno prophylaxis (Arm A vs. Arm B) on the number of bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation \nfactors over time (minimum of 24 weeks or date of discontinuation) (see Table 6). Other secondary \nobjectives of the randomised comparison of Arms A and B were the efficacy of weekly Hemlibra \nprophylaxis in reducing the number of all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, joint bleeds and target joint \nbleeds (see Table 6), as well as assessing patients’ HRQoL and health status (see Tables 9 and 10). \nThe mean exposure time (+SD) for all patients on study was 21.38 weeks (12.01). For each treatment \narm, the mean exposure times (+SD) were 28.86 weeks (8.37) for Arm A, 8.79 (3.62) for Arm B, \n21.56 (11.85) for Arm C and 7.08 (3.89) for Arm D. One patient in Arm A withdrew from study prior \nto initiation of Hemlibra. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nThe study also evaluated the efficacy of weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis compared with previous \nepisodic (on-demand) and prophylactic bypassing agents (separate comparisons) in patients who had \nparticipated in the NIS prior to enrolment (Arms A and C, respectively) (see Table 7).  \n \nPatients (aged ≥ 12 years old) with haemophilia A with or without factor VIII inhibitors (Study \nBO39182 – HAVEN 4) \n \nHemlibra was investigated in a single arm, multicenter, phase III clinical study in 41 adult and \nadolescent males (aged ≥ 12 years and > 40 kg) who have hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors or \nsevere hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic (“on demand”) \nor prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents or FVIII.  Patients received Hemlibra prophylaxis – \n3 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks thereafter.   \nThe primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis given every \nfour weeks in maintaining adequate bleed control, based on treated bleeds.  Other objectives were to \nevaluate the clinical efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis on all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, \ntreated joint bleeds and treated target joint bleeds  (see Table 8).  Patient treatment preference was also \nassessed using a preference survey. \n \nAdults and Adolescents Efficacy Results \n \nHAVEN 3 \n \nThe efficacy results of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis with respect to rate of \ntreated bleeds, all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds, and treated target joint \nbleeds are shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4 HAVEN 3 study: Annualised Bleed Rate for Hemlibra prophylaxis arm versus no \n\nprophylaxis arm in patients ≥ 12 years of age without factor VIII inhibitors \n \n\n Endpoint \nArm C: \n\nNo Prophylaxis \n(N = 18) \n\nArm A: \nHemlibra \n\n1.5 mg/kg weekly \n(N = 36) \n\nArm B: \nHemlibra \n3 mg/kg \n\nevery 2 weeks \n(N = 35) \n\nTreated Bleeds  \n\nABR (95% CI)  38.2 (22.9; 63.8) 1.5 (0.9; 2.5) 1.3 (0.8; 2.3) \n\n% reduction (RR), p-value \n \n \n\nNA \n96% (0.04), \n< 0.0001 97% (0.03), < 0.0001 \n\n% patients with 0 bleeds \n(95% CI) 0.0 (0.0; 18.5) 55.6 (38.1; 72.1) 60.0 (42.1; 76.1) \n\nMedian ABR (IQR) 40.4 (25.3; 56.7) 0 (0; 2.5) 0 (0; 1.9) \nAll Bleeds \n\nABR (95% CI) 47.6 (28.5; 79.6) 2.5 (1.6; 3.9) 2.6 (1.6; 4.3) \n\n% reduction (RR), p-value NA 95% (0.05 <0.0001 94% (0.06), <0.0001 \n\n% patients with 0 bleeds \n(95% CI) \n\n0 (0.0:18.5) 50 (32.9; 67.1) 40 (23.9; 57.9) \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n Endpoint \nArm C: \n\nNo Prophylaxis \n(N = 18) \n\nArm A: \nHemlibra \n\n1.5 mg/kg weekly \n(N = 36) \n\nArm B: \nHemlibra \n3 mg/kg \n\nevery 2 weeks \n(N = 35) \n\nTreated Spontaneous Bleeds \n\nABR (95% CI) 15.6 (7.6; 31.9) 1.0 (0.5; 1.9) 0.3 (0.1; 0.8) \n\n% reduction (RR), p-value NA 94% (0.06), <0.0001 98% (0.02), <0.0001 \n\n% patients with 0 bleeds \n(95% CI) \n\n22.2 (6.4; 47.6) 66.7 (49.0; 81.4) 88.6 (73.3; 96.8) \n\nTreated Joint Bleeds \n\nABR (95% CI)  26.5 (14.67; 47.79) 1.1 (0.59; 1.89) 0.9 (0.44; 1.67) \n\n% reduction (RR), p-value NA 96% (0.04), <0.0001 97% (0.03), <0.0001 \n\n% patients with 0 bleeds \n(95% CI) \n\n0 (0; 18.5) 58.3 (40.8; 74.5) 74.3 (56.7; 87.5) \n\nTreated Target Joint Bleeds \n\nABR (95% CI) 13.0 (5.2; 32.3) 0.6 (0.3; 1.4) 0.7 (0.3; 1.6) \n\n% reduction (RR), p-value NA 95% (0.05), <0.0001 95% (0.05),  <0.0001 \n\n% patients with 0 bleeds \n(95% CI) \n\n27.8 (9.7; 53.5) 69.4 (51.9; 83.7) 77.1 (59.9; 89.6) \n\n \nRate ratio, and confidence interval (CI) come from negative binomial regression (NBR) model and p-value from Stratified \nWald test, comparing bleed rate between specified arms. \n Arm C: includes no prophylaxis period only. \n  Bleed definitions adapted based on ISTH criteria. \n  Treated bleeds = bleeds treated with FVIII \n  All bleeds = bleeds treated and not treated with FVIII. \n  Includes data before up-titration only, for patients whose dose was up-titrated. \n  Patients exposed to emicizumab started with a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks.  \n ABR= Annualised Bleed Rate; CI= confidence interval; RR= rate ratio; IQR= interquartile range, 25th percentile to 75th \npercentile, NA=Not Applicable \n \n\n \nIn the HAVEN 3 clinical study intra-patient analysis, Hemlibra prophylaxis resulted in a statistically \nsignificant (p<0.0001) reduction (68 %) in bleed rate for treated bleeds compared with previous FVIII \nprophylaxis collected in the NIS prior to enrollment (see Table 5). \n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nTable 5 HAVEN 3 study: Intra-patient comparison of Annualized Bleed Rate (treated \nBleeds) with Hemlibra prophylaxis versus previous FVIII prophylaxis \n\n \n Endpoint Arm D NIS:  \n\nPrevious FVIII Prophylaxis \n(N = 48) \n\nArm D:  \nHemlibra 1.5 mg/kg weekly \n(N = 48) \n\nMedian Efficacy Period (weeks) 30.1 33.7 \nTreated Bleeds \nABR (95% CI) a 4.8 (3.2; 7.1) 1.5 (1; 2.3) \n% reduction (RR), p-value 68% (0.32), <0.0001 \n% patients with zero bleeds \n(95% CI) 39.6 (25.8; 54.7) 54.2 (39.2; 68.6) \n\nMedian ABR (IQR) 1.8 (0; 7.6) 0 (0; 2.1) \nRate ratio and confidence interval (CI) comes from negative binomial regression (NBR) model and p-\nvalue  from Stratified Wald test, comparing ABR between specified arms.  \n\nIntra-patient comparator data from the NIS.

For bypassing agent guidance refer to section 4.4.  \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response in patients treated with \nemicizumab. A total of 398 patients were tested for anti-emicizumab antibodies in the HAVEN 1-4 \nclinical trials. Less than 5 % of  patients  tested positive for anti-emicizumab antibodies and  < 1 % of \npatients had anti-emicizumab antibodies with neutralizing potential (based on declining \npharmacokinetics). Loss of efficacy was reported in 1 out of 398 patients. . \n \nIn case of clinical signs of loss of efficacy, a change of treatment should be considered. \n \nElderly population \n \nUse of Hemlibra in patients aged 65 and over with haemophilia A is supported by adult and adolescent \nstudies HAVEN 1, HAVEN 3, and HAVEN 4. Based on limited data, there is no evidence to suggest a \ndifference in efficacy or safety in patients aged 65 years or above.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nHemlibra in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of hereditary factor VIII \ndeficiency (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emicizumab was determined via non-compartmental analysis in healthy \nsubjects and using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a database composed of 389 patients with \nhaemophilia A. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nAbsorption  \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration in haemophilia A patients, the absorption half-life was \n1.6 days.  \n \nFollowing multiple subcutaneous administrations of 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks in \nhaemophilia A patients, mean (±SD) trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab achieved \n52.6±13.6 µg/mL at Week 5. \n \nThe predicted mean (±SD) Ctrough ,and Cmax and ratios of Cmax/Ctrough at steady- state for the \nrecommended maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks or 6 mg/kg \nevery four weeks are shown in Table 14 . \n \nTable 14 Mean (± SD) steady-state emicizumab concentrations \n \n Maintenance dose \n\nParameters 1.5 mg/kg once weekly 3 mg/kg every two \nweeks \n\n6 mg/kg every four \nweeks \n\nCmax, ss (µg/mL) 54.9±15.9 58.1±16.5 66.8±17.7 \n\nCavg, ss (µg/mL) 53.5 ±15.7 53.5 ±15.7 53.5 ±15.7 \n\nCtrough, ss (µg/mL) 51.1±15.3 46.7±16.9 38.3±14.3 \n\nCmax/Ctrough ratio 1.08±0.03 1.26±0.12 1.85±0.46 \n\nCavg, ss = average concentration at steady state; Cmax, ss = maximum plasma concentration at steady state; Ctrough, ss \n= trough concentration at steady state; QW = once weekly; Q2W = every two weeks; Q4W = every four weeks.  \nPharmacokinetic parameters derived from the population PK model. \n\n \nSimilar PK  profiles were observed following once weekly dosing (3 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks \nfollowed by 1.5 mg/kg/week) in adults/adolescents (≥ 12 years) and children (< 12 years) (see \nFigure 1). \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nFigure 1:  Mean (±95% CI) plasma emicizumab concentration versus time profiles for \npatients ≥ 12 years (studies HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 3) compared with patients < 12 years (study \nHAVEN 2) \n \n\n \n \nIn healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg was \nbetween 80.4% and 93.1% depending on the injection site. Similar pharmacokinetic profiles were \nobserved following subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, upper arm, and thigh. Emicizumab \ncan be administered interchangeably at these anatomical sites (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution  \n \nFollowing a single intravenous dose of 0.25 mg/kg emicizumab in healthy subjects, the volume of \ndistribution at steady state was 106 mL/kg (i.e. 7.4 L for a 70-kg adult).  \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F), estimated from the population PK analysis, in haemophilia \nA patients following multiple subcutaneous doses of emicizumab was 10.4 L. \n \nMetabolism \n \nThe metabolism of emicizumab has not been studied. IgG antibodies are mainly catabolised by \nlysosomal proteolysis and then eliminated from or reused by the body. \n \nElimination  \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of 0.25 mg/kg in healthy subjects, the total clearance of \nemicizumab was 3.26 mL/kg/day (i.e. 0.228 L/d for a 70-kg adult) and the mean terminal half-life was \n26.7 days. \n \nFollowing single subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, the elimination half-life was \napproximately 4 to 5 weeks. \n \nFollowing multiple subcutaneous injections in haemophilia A patients, the apparent clearance was \n0.272 L/day and the elimination apparent half-life was 26.8 days. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nDose linearity \n \nEmicizumab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in patients with haemophilia A after the \nfirst dose of Hemlibra over a dose range from 0.3 to 6 mg/kg . The exposure (Cavg, ss) of multiple doses \nis comparable between 1.5 mg/kg every week, 3mg/kg every 2 weeks and 6mg/kg dose every 4 weeks. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nPaediatric \n \nThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab was assessed in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included 5 infants (≥ 1 month to < 2 years),  55 children (less \nthan 12 years) and 50 adolescents (12 to < 18 years) with haemophilia A.  \nAge did not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab in paediatric patients.  \n \nElderly \n \nThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab was assessed in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included thirteen subjects aged 65 years and older (no subjects were \nolder than 77 years of age). Relative bioavailability decreased with older age, but no clinically \nimportant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab between subjects \n< 65 years and subjects ≥ 65 years.  \n \nRace \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics analyses in patients with haemophilia A showed that race did not affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. No dose adjustment is required for this demographic factor.   \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dedicated studies of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have \nbeen conducted.  \n \nMost of the patients with hemophilia A in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal \nfunction (N = 332; creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 90 mL/min) or mild renal impairment (N = 27; CLcr \nof 60-89 mL/min).  Mild renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. . There \nare limited data available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with moderate renal impairment (only 2 \npatients with CLcr of 30-59 mL/min) and no data in patients with severe renal impairment. The impact \nof moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab cannot be \nconcluded. \n \nEmicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism rather than renal excretion and a \nchange in dose is not expected to be required for patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dedicated studies on the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have \nbeen conducted. Most of the patients with haemophilia A in the population pharmacokinetic analysis \nhad normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, N = 300) or mild hepatic impairment \n(bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin from 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST, N = 51). Only \n6 patients had moderate hepatic impairment (1.5 × ULN <  bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN and any AST).  Mild \nhepatic impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab (see section 4.2). The safety \nand efficacy of emicizumab have not been specifically tested in patients with hepatic impairment. \nPatients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were included in clinical trials. No data are \navailable on the use of Hemlibra in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nEmicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and cleared via catabolism rather than hepatic metabolism and \na change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nOther special populations \n \nModelling shows that less frequent dosing in patients with hypoalbuminemia and low body weight for \ntheir age results in lower emicizumab exposures; simulations indicate that these patients would still \nbenefit from clinically meaningful bleed control. No patients with such characteristics were enrolled in \nclinical trials. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on studies of acute and repeated dose \ntoxicity, including safety pharmacology endpoints and endpoints for reproductive toxicity.  \n \nFertility \n \nEmicizumab did not cause any changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus \nmonkeys up to the highest tested dose of 30 mg/kg/week (equivalent to 11 times the human exposure \nat the highest dose of 3 mg/kg/week, based on AUC). \n \nTeratogenicity \n \nNo data are available with respect to potential side effects of emicizumab on embryo-foetal \ndevelopment.  \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nReversible hemorrhage, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, degeneration/necrosis of subcutis \nand swelling of endothelium in the subcutis was noted in animals after subcutaneous injection. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nHemlibra 30 mg/mL solution for injection \n\n \nemicizumab \n\n \n \n\n This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n● Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n● If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n● This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.   \n● If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Hemlibra is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Hemlibra \n3. How to use Hemlibra \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Hemlibra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Hemlibra is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Hemlibra is \n \nHemlibra contains the active substance “emicizumab”. This belongs to a group of medicines called \n“monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that recognise and bind to a \ntarget in the body. \n \nWhat Hemlibra is used for \n \nHemlibra is a medicine used for treating patients of all ages with  \n● either haemophilia A who  have developed factor VIII inhibitors  \n● or with severe haemophilia A who have not developed factor VIII inhibitors (the FVIII blood  \nlevel is less than 1%). \n \nHaemophilia A is an inherited condition caused by a lack of factor VIII, an essential substance \nrequired for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. \n \nThe medicine prevents bleeding or reduces bleeding episodes in people with this condition. \n \nSome patients with haemophilia A can develop factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies against factor VIII) \nwhich stop the replacement factor VIII from working. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nHow Hemlibra works \n \nHemlibra restores the function of missing activated factor VIII  that is needed for effective blood \nclotting. Its structure is different from factor VIII, therefore Hemlibra is not affected by factor VIII \ninhibitors.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Hemlibra  \n \nDo not use Hemlibra: \n \n● if you are allergic to emicizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Hemlibra. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nBefore you start using Hemlibra, it is very important to talk to your doctor about using \n“bypassing agents” (medicines that help blood clot but which work in a different way from factor \nVIII). This is because treatment with bypassing agents may need to change while receiving \nHemlibra. Examples of bypassing agents include activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) \nand recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa). Serious and potentially life-threatening side effects can occur when \naPCC is used in patients who are also receiving Hemlibra: Potentially serious side effects of using \naPCC while receiving Hemlibra  \n \n● Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) \n\n- This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  \n- When people have this condition, the lining of the blood vessels can be damaged and \n\nblood clots may develop in small blood vessels. In some cases, this can cause damage to \nthe kidneys and other organs.  \n\n- Be cautious if you are at high risk for this condition (have had this condition in the past, \nor a member of your family have suffered from it), or if you are taking medicines that can \nincrease the risk of developing this condition, such as ciclosporin, quinine or tacrolimus. \n\n- It is important to know the symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy, in case you \ndevelop the condition (see section 4, “Possible side effects” for a list of symptoms).  \n\n \nStop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices \nany symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy. \n\n \n● Blood clots (thromboembolism) \n\n- In rare cases, a blood clot can form inside blood vessels and block them, which may be \nlife-threatening.  \n\n- It is important to know the symptoms of such internal blood clots, in case they develop \n(see section 4, “Possible side effects” for a list of symptoms). \n\n \nStop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices \nany symptoms of blood clots in blood vessels.     \n \nChildren below the age of 1 year \n \nIn children less than one year of age, the blood system is still developing. If your child is less than one \nyear old, your doctor may prescribe Hemlibra only after carefully weighing the expected benefits and \nrisks of using this product.  \n \nOther medicines and Hemlibra \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n● Using a bypassing agent while receiving Hemlibra \n- Before you start using Hemlibra, talk to your doctor and carefully follow their \n\ninstructions on when to use a bypassing agent and the dose and schedule you should \nuse. Hemlibra increases the ability of your blood to clot. Therefore, the dose of bypassing \nagent required may be lower than the dose you used before starting Hemlibra.  \n\n- Use aPCC only if no other treatment can be used.  If aPCC is required, talk to your doctor \nin case you feel you need a total of more than 50 units/kg of aPCC. For more information \non using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra, see in section 2: “Potentially serious side \neffects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra”.  \n\n- Despite limited experience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics with \naPCC or rFVIIa in patients treated with Hemlibra, you should know that there may be a \npossibility of thrombotic events using anti-fibrinolytics administered intravenously in \ncombination with aPCC or rFVIIa. \n\n \nLaboratory tests \n \nTell your doctor if you are using Hemlibra before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your \nblood is clotting. This is because Hemlibra in the blood may interfere with some laboratory tests, \nleading to inaccurate results. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n● You should use an effective method of birth control (contraception) during treatment with \n\nHemlibra and for 6 months after your last injection of Hemlibra. \n● If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will consider \nthe benefit of you taking Hemlibra against the risk to your baby. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Hemlibra \n \nHemlibra is provided in single-use vials as ready to use solution which does not need to be diluted. \nA doctor qualified to care for patients with haemophilia will start you on treatment with Hemlibra. \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your healthcare provider if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nKeeping a record \n \nEach time you use Hemlibra, record the name and batch number of the medicine. \n \nHow much Hemlibra to use \n \nThe dose of Hemlibra depends on your weight and your doctor  \nwill calculate the amount (in mg) and corresponding  amount of Hemlibra solution (in mL) to be \ninjected: \n \n● Loading dose regimen: Weeks 1 to 4: The dose is 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, \n\ninjected once a week. \n \n● Maintenance dose regimen: Week 5 and onwards: The dose is either 1.5 milligrams for every \n\n1 kilogram you weigh, injected once a week, 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, \ninjected every 2 weeks, or 6 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, injected every 4 weeks.  \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nThe decision, to use either the 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 6 mg/kg every \nfour weeks maintenance dose, should be made in consultation with your doctor and, where applicable, \nwith your caregiver. \n \nDifferent Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in a single \ninjection when making up the total volume to be injected. \n \nThe amount of Hemlibra solution given in each injection must not be more than 2 mL  \n \nHow Hemlibra is given \n \nIf you inject Hemlibra yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must \ncarefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”. \n \n● Hemlibra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). \n● Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject Hemlibra. \n● Once you have been trained, you should be able to inject this medicine at home, by yourself or \n\nwith the help of a caregiver.  \n● To correctly insert the needle under the skin, pinch a fold of loose skin at the clean injection site \n\nwith your free hand. Pinching the skin is important to ensure that you inject under the skin (into \nfatty tissue) but not any deeper (into muscle). Injecting into a muscle could cause discomfort. \n\n● Prepare and give the injection in clean and germ-free conditions using aseptic technique. Your \ndoctor or nurse will give more information about this. \n\n \nWhere to inject Hemlibra  \n \n● Your doctor will show you which areas of the body  are suitable for injecting Hemlibra.  \n● The recommended places to give an injection are: the front of the waist (lower abdomen), upper \n\nouter arms, or the front of the thighs. Use only recommended places for injection.  \n● For each injection, use a different area of the body to the one you used last time.  \n● Do not give injections where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, or areas where there are \n\nmoles or scars. \n● When using Hemlibra, any other medicine injected under the skin should be given in a different \n\narea. \n \nUsing syringes and needles \n \n● A syringe, a transfer needle (or vial adapter), and an injection needle are needed to draw up the \n\nHemlibra solution from the vial into the syringe and to inject it under the skin.  \n● Syringes, transfer needles, vial adapters and injection needles are not provided in this pack. For \n\nmore information, see in section 6 “What is needed for Hemlibra administration and is not \ncontained in this pack”.  \n\n● Make sure that you use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it after a single \nuse. \n\n● A 1 mL syringe should be used for an injection up to 1 mL of Hemlibra solution. \n● A 2 to 3 mL syringe should be used for an injection greater than 1 mL and up to 2 mL of \n\nHemlibra solution. \n● When used together with a vial adapter, a low dead space plunger syringe must be used. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nHemlibra can be used in adolescents and children of all ages.  \n● A child can self-inject the medicine provided the child’s healthcare provider and the parent or \n\ncaregiver agree. Self-injection for children below the age of 7 years is not recommended.  \n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nIf you use more Hemlibra than you should \n \nIf you use more Hemlibra than you are supposed to, tell your doctor immediately. This is because you \nmay be at risk of developing side effects such as blood clots. Always use Hemlibra exactly as your \ndoctor has told you, and check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you forget to use Hemlibra \n \n● If you forget your scheduled injection, inject the forgotten dose as soon as possible before the \n\nday of the next scheduled dose. Then, continue to inject the medicine  as scheduled. Do not \ninject two doses on the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n● If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you stop using Hemlibra \n \nDo not stop using Hemlibra without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Hemlibra, you may no \nlonger be protected against bleeding. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra \n \nStop using Hemlibra and aPCC and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices \nany of the following side effects:  \n● Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy):  \n\n- confusion, weakness, swelling of arms and legs, yellowing of skin and eyes, vague belly \n(abdominal) or back pain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) or urinating less – \nthese symptoms may be signs of thrombotic microangiopathy.      \n\n● Blood clots (thromboembolism):   \n- swelling, warmth, pain or redness – these symptoms may be signs of a blood clot in a \n\nvein near the surface of the skin. \n- headache, numbness in your face, eye pain or swelling or problems with your vision – \n\nthese symptoms may be signs of a blood clot in a vein behind your eye. \n- blackening of the skin – this symptom may be a sign of severe damage to the skin tissue. \n\n \nOther side effects when using Hemlibra \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n● a reaction in the area where the injection is given (redness, itching, pain) \n● headache  \n● joint pain \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n● fever \n● muscle aches \n● diarrhoea \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n● destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) \n● blood clot in a vein behind your eye (cavernous sinus thrombosis) \n● severe damage of the skin tissue (skin necrosis) \n● blood clot in a vein near the surface of the skin (superficial thrombophlebitis) \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

What you need to know before you use Hemlibra \n3. How to use Hemlibra \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Hemlibra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Hemlibra is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Hemlibra is \n \nHemlibra contains the active substance “emicizumab”. This belongs to a group of medicines called \n“monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that recognise and bind to a \ntarget in the body. \n \nWhat Hemlibra is used for \n \nHemlibra is a medicine used for treating patients of all ages with  \n● either haemophilia A who  have developed factor VIII inhibitors  \n● or with severe haemophilia A who have not developed factor VIII inhibitors (the FVIII blood \n\nlevel is less than 1%). \n \nHaemophilia A is an inherited condition caused by a lack of factor VIII, an essential substance \nrequired for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. \n \nThe medicine prevents bleeding or reduces bleeding episodes in people with this condition. \n \nSome patients with haemophilia A can develop factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies against factor VIII) \nwhich stop the replacement factor VIII from working. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n \n\nHow Hemlibra works \n \nHemlibra restores the function of missing activated factor VIII  that is needed for effective blood \nclotting Its structure is different from factor VIII, therefore Hemlibra is not affected by factor VIII \ninhibitors.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Hemlibra  \n \nDo not use Hemlibra: \n \n● if you are allergic to emicizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Hemlibra. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nBefore you start using Hemlibra, it is very important to talk to your doctor about using \n“bypassing agents” (medicines that help blood clot but which work in a different way from factor \nVIII). This is because treatment with bypassing agents may need to change while receiving \nHemlibra. Examples of bypassing agents include activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) \nand recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa). Serious and potentially life-threatening side effects can occur when \naPCC is used in patients who are also receiving Hemlibra: Potentially serious side effects of using \naPCC while receiving Hemlibra  \n \n● Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) \n\n- This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  \n- When people have this condition, the lining of the blood vessels can be damaged and \n\nblood clots may develop in small blood vessels. In some cases, this can cause damage to \nthe kidneys and other organs.  \n\n- Be cautious if you are at high risk for this condition (have had this condition in the past, \nor a member of your family have suffered from it), or if you are taking medicines that can \nincrease the risk of developing this condition, such as ciclosporin, quinine or tacrolimus. \n\n- It is important to know the symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy, in case you \ndevelop the condition (see section 4, “Possible side effects” for a list of symptoms).  \n\n \nStop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices \nany symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy. \n\n \n● Blood clots (thromboembolism) \n\n- In rare cases, a blood clot can form inside blood vessels and block them, which may be \nlife-threatening.  \n\n- It is important to know the symptoms of such internal blood clots, in case they develop \n(see section 4, “Possible side effects” for a list of symptoms). \n\n \nStop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices \nany symptoms of blood clots in blood vessels.     \n \nChildren below the age of 1 year \n \nIn children less than one year of age, the blood system is still developing. If your child is less than one \nyear old, your doctor may prescribe Hemlibra only after carefully weighing the expected benefits and \nrisks of using this product.  \n \nOther medicines and Hemlibra \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n \n\n● Using a bypassing agent while receiving Hemlibra \n- Before you start using Hemlibra, talk to your doctor and carefully follow their \n\ninstructions on when to use a bypassing agent and the dose and schedule you should \nuse. Hemlibra increases the ability of your blood to clot. Therefore, the dose of bypassing \nagent required may be lower than the dose you used before starting Hemlibra.  \n\n- Use aPCC only if no other treatment can be used.  If aPCC is required, talk to your doctor \nin case you feel you need a total of more than 50 units/kg of aPCC. For more information \non using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra, see in section 2: “Potentially serious side \neffects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra”.  \n\n- Despite limited experience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics with \naPCC or rFVIIa in patients treated with Hemlibra, you should know that there may be a \npossibility of thrombotic events using anti-fibrinolytics administered intravenously in \ncombination with aPCC or rFVIIa. \n\n \nLaboratory tests \n \nTell your doctor if you are using Hemlibra before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your \nblood is clotting. This is because Hemlibra in the blood may interfere with some laboratory tests, \nleading to inaccurate results. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n● You should use an effective method of birth control (contraception) during treatment with \n\nHemlibra and for 6 months after your last injection of Hemlibra. \n● If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will consider \nthe benefit of you taking Hemlibra against the risk to your baby. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Hemlibra \n \nHemlibra is provided in single-use vials as ready to use solution which does not need to be diluted. \nA doctor qualified to care for patients with haemophilia will start you on treatment with Hemlibra. \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your healthcare provider if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nKeeping a record \n \nEach time you use Hemlibra, record the name and batch number of the medicine. \n \nHow much Hemlibra to use \n \nThe dose of Hemlibra depends on your weight and your doctor  \nwill calculate the amount (in mg) and corresponding  amount of Hemlibra solution (in mL) to be \ninjected: \n \n● Loading dose regimen: Weeks 1 to 4: The dose is 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, \n\ninjected once a week. \n \n● Maintenance dose regimen: Week 5 and onwards: The dose is either 1.5 milligrams for every \n\n1 kilogram you weigh, injected once a week, 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, \ninjected every 2 weeks, or 6 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, injected every 4 weeks.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n \n\nThe decision, to use either the 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 6 mg/kg every \nfour weeks maintenance dose, should be made in consultation with your doctor and, where applicable, \nwith your caregiver. \n  \nDifferent Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in a single \ninjection when making up the total volume to be injected. \n \nThe amount of Hemlibra solution given in each injection must not be more than 2 mL  \n \nHow Hemlibra is given \n \nIf you inject Hemlibra yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must \ncarefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”. \n \n● Hemlibra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). \n● Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject Hemlibra. \n● Once you have been trained, you should be able to inject this medicine at home, by yourself or \n\nwith the help of a caregiver.  \n● To correctly insert the needle under the skin, pinch a fold of loose skin at the clean injection site \n\nwith your free hand. Pinching the skin is important to ensure that you inject under the skin (into \nfatty tissue) but not any deeper (into muscle). Injecting into a muscle could  cause discomfort. \n\n● Prepare and give the injection in clean and germ-free conditions using aseptic technique. Your \ndoctor or nurse will give more information about this. \n\n \nWhere to inject Hemlibra  \n \n● Your doctor will show you which areas of the body  are suitable for injecting Hemlibra.  \n● The recommended places to give an injection are: the front of the waist (lower abdomen), upper \n\nouter arms, or the front of the thighs. Use only recommended places for injection.  \n● For each injection, use a different area of the body to the one you used last time.  \n● Do not give injections where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, or areas where there are \n\nmoles or scars. \n● When using Hemlibra, any other medicine injected under the skin should be given in a different \n\narea. \n \nUsing syringes and needles \n \n● A syringe, a transfer needle (or vial adapter), and an injection needle are needed to draw up the \n\nHemlibra solution from the vial into the syringe and to inject it under the skin.  \n● Syringes, transfer needles, vial adapters and injection needles are not provided in this pack. For \n\nmore information, see in section 6 “What is needed for Hemlibra administration and is not \ncontained in this pack”.  \n\n● Make sure that you use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it after a single \nuse. \n\n● A 1 mL syringe should be used for an injection up to 1 mL of Hemlibra solution. \n● A 2 to 3 mL syringe should be used for an injection greater than 1 mL and up to 2 mL of \n\nHemlibra solution. \n● When used together with a vial adapter, a low dead space plunger syringe must be used. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nHemlibra can be used in adolescents and children of all ages.  \n● A child can self-inject the medicine provided the child’s healthcare provider and the parent or \n\ncaregiver agree. Self-injection for children below the age of 7 years is not recommended.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n \n\nIf you use more Hemlibra than you should \n \nIf you use more Hemlibra than you are supposed to, tell your doctor immediately. This is because you \nmay be at risk of developing side effects such as blood clots. Always use Hemlibra exactly as your \ndoctor has told you, and check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you forget to use Hemlibra \n \n● If you forget your scheduled injection, inject the forgotten dose as soon as possible before the \n\nday of the next scheduled dose. Then, continue to inject the medicine as scheduled. Do not \ninject two doses on the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n● If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you stop using Hemlibra \n \nDo not stop using Hemlibra without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Hemlibra, you may no \nlonger be protected against bleeding. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra \n \nStop using Hemlibra and aPCC and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices \nany of the following side effects:  \n● Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy):  \n\n- confusion, weakness, swelling of arms and legs, yellowing of skin and eyes, vague belly \n(abdominal) or back pain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) or urinating less – \nthese symptoms may be signs of thrombotic microangiopathy.      \n\n● Blood clots (thromboembolism):   \n- swelling, warmth, pain or redness – these symptoms may be signs of a blood clot in a \n\nvein near the surface of the skin. \n- headache, numbness in your face, eye pain or swelling or problems with your vision – \n\nthese symptoms may be signs of a blood clot in a vein behind your eye. \n- blackening of the skin – this symptom may be a sign of severe damage to the skin tissue. \n\n \nOther side effects when using Hemlibra \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n● a reaction in the area where the injection is given (redness, itching, pain) \n● headache \n● joint pain \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n● fever \n● muscle aches \n● diarrhoea \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n● destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) \n● blood clot in a vein behind your eye (cavernous sinus thrombosis) \n● severe damage of the skin tissue (skin necrosis) \n● blood clot in a vein near the surface of the skin (superficial thrombophlebitis) \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
