CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nTofacitinib in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe \nactive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are \nintolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Tofacitinib can be given as monotherapy \nin case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nTofacitinib in combination with MTX is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in \nadult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nTofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative \ncolitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional \ntherapy or a biologic agent (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of conditions for which tofacitinib is indicated. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose is 5 mg administered twice daily, which should not be exceeded. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nSwitching between tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets and tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets \nPatients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily may be switched to tofacitinib 11 mg \nprolonged-release tablets once daily on the day following the last dose of tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated \ntablets.  \n \nPatients treated with tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets once daily may be switched to tofacitinib \n5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily on the day following the last dose of tofacitinib 11 mg \nprolonged-release tablets. \n \nDose adjustment  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required when used in combination with MTX. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nInduction treatment \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg given orally twice daily for induction for 8 weeks.  \n \nFor patients who do not achieve adequate therapeutic benefit by week 8, the induction dose of 10 mg \ntwice daily can be extended for an additional 8 weeks (16 weeks total), followed by 5 mg twice daily for \nmaintenance. Tofacitinib induction therapy should be discontinued in any patient who shows no evidence \nof therapeutic benefit by week 16. \n \nMaintenance treatment \nThe recommended dose for maintenance treatment is tofacitinib 5 mg given orally twice daily. \n \nTofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for maintenance treatment is not recommended in patients with UC who \nhave known venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors, unless there is no suitable alternative treatment \navailable (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nFor patients with UC who are not at increased risk for VTE (see section 4.4), tofacitinib 10 mg orally \ntwice daily may be considered if the patient experiences a decrease in response on tofacitinib 5 mg twice \ndaily and failed to respond to alternative treatment options for ulcerative colitis such as tumour necrosis \nfactor inhibitor (TNF inhibitor) treatment. Tofacitinib 10\u202fmg twice daily for maintenance treatment should \nbe used for the shortest duration possible. The lowest effective dose needed to maintain response should \nbe used. \n \nIn patients who have responded to treatment with tofacitinib, corticosteroids may be reduced and/or \ndiscontinued in accordance with standard of care. \n \nRetreatment in UC \nIf therapy is interrupted, restarting treatment with tofacitinib can be considered. If there has been a loss of \nresponse, reinduction with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily may be considered. The treatment interruption \nperiod in clinical studies extended up to 1 year. Efficacy may be regained by 8 weeks of 10 mg twice daily \ntherapy (see section 5.1).  \n \nDose interruption and discontinuation  \n \nTofacitinib treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is \ncontrolled. \n \nInterruption of dosing may be needed for management of dose-related laboratory abnormalities including \nlymphopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. As described in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below, recommendations for \ntemporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of treatment are made according to the severity \nof laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended not to initiate dosing in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than \n750 cells/mm3. \n \nTable 1: Low absolute lymphocyte count \n\nLow absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (see section 4.4) \nLab value \n(cells/mm3) \n\nRecommendation \n\nALC greater than or equal \nto 750 \n\nDose should be maintained. \n\nALC 500-750 For persistent (2 sequential values in this range on routine testing) \ndecrease in this range, dosing should be reduced or interrupted until \nALC is greater than 750.  \n \nFor patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, dosing should be \nreduced to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. \n \nFor patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, dosing should be \ninterrupted. \n \nWhen ALC is greater than 750, treatment should be resumed as \nclinically appropriate. \n\nALC less than 500 \n \n\nIf lab value confirmed by repeat testing within 7 days, dosing should \nbe discontinued. \n\n \nIt is recommended not to initiate dosing in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than \n1,000 cells/mm3. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nTable 2: Low absolute neutrophil count \nLow absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (see section 4.4) \n\nLab Value \n(cells/mm3) \n\nRecommendation \n\nANC greater than 1,000 Dose should be maintained. \nANC 500-1,000 For persistent (2 sequential values in this range on routine testing) \n\ndecreases in this range, dosing should be reduced or interrupted until \nANC is greater than 1,000. \n \nFor patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, dosing should be \nreduced to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. \n \nFor patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, dosing should be \ninterrupted. \n \nWhen ANC is greater than 1,000, treatment should be resumed as \nclinically appropriate. \n\nANC less than 500 \n \n\nIf lab value confirmed by repeat testing within 7 days, dosing should \nbe discontinued.  \n\n \nIt is recommended not to initiate dosing in patients with haemoglobin less than 9 g/dL. \n \nTable 3: Low haemoglobin value \n\nLow haemoglobin value (Section 4.4) \nLab value \n\n(g/dL) \nRecommendation \n\nLess than or equal to 2 g/dL \ndecrease and greater than or \nequal to 9.0 g/dL \n\nDose should be maintained. \n\nGreater than 2 g/dL \ndecrease or less than \n8.0 g/dL \n(confirmed by repeat \ntesting) \n\nDosing should be interrupted until haemoglobin values have \nnormalised. \n\n \nDrug-drug interactions \nTofacitinib total daily dose should be reduced by half in patients receiving potent inhibitors of cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) and in patients receiving 1 or more concomitant medicinal products \nthat result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 as well as potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., \nfluconazole) (see section 4.5) as follows: \n\u2022 Tofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg once daily in patients receiving 5 mg twice daily. \n\u2022 Tofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg twice daily in patients receiving 10 mg twice daily.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years and older. There are limited data in patients aged \n75 years and older. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nHepatic impairment \n  \nTable 4:  Dose adjustment for hepatic impairment  \nHepatic \nimpairment \ncategory \n\nClassification Dose adjustment in hepatic impairment for different \nstrength tablets \n\nMild Child Pugh A No dose adjustment required. \nModerate Child Pugh B Dose should be reduced to 5 mg once daily when the \n\nindicated dose in the presence of normal hepatic function \nis 5 mg twice daily. \n \nDose should be reduced to 5 mg twice daily when the \nindicated dose in the presence of normal hepatic function \nis 10 mg twice daily (see section 5.2). \n\nSevere Child Pugh C Tofacitinib should not be used in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n  \nTable 5:  Dose adjustment for renal impairment  \nRenal \nimpairment \ncategory \n\nCreatinine \nclearance \n\nDose adjustment in renal impairment for different \nstrength tablets \n\nMild 50-80 mL/min No dose adjustment required. \nModerate 30-49 mL/min No dose adjustment required. \nSevere (including \npatients \nundergoing \nhaemodialysis) \n\n< 30 mL/min Dose should be reduced to 5 mg once daily when the \nindicated dose in the presence of normal renal function is \n5 mg twice daily. \n \nDose should be reduced to 5 mg twice daily when the \nindicated dose in the presence of normal renal function is \n10 mg twice daily.  \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment should remain on a \nreduced dose even after haemodialysis (see section 5.2). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in children aged 0 to less than 18 years have not been established. \n \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use.  \n \nTofacitinib is given orally with or without food. \n \nFor patients who have difficulties swallowing, tofacitinib tablets may be crushed and taken with water.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Active tuberculosis (TB), serious infections such as sepsis, or opportunistic infections (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\u2022 Severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\u2022 Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCombination with other therapies \n \nTofacitinib has not been studied and its use should be avoided in combination with biologics such as TNF \nantagonists, interleukin (IL)-1R antagonists, IL-6R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, IL-17 \nantagonists, IL-12/IL-23 antagonists, anti-integrins, selective co-stimulation modulators and potent \nimmunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, ciclosporine and tacrolimus because of the \npossibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection. \n \nThere was a higher incidence of adverse events for the combination of tofacitinib with MTX versus \ntofacitinib as monotherapy in RA clinical studies. \n \nThe use of tofacitinib in combination with phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors has not been studied in \ntofacitinib clinical studies. \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE)  \n \nSerious VTE events including pulmonary embolism (PE), some of which were fatal, and deep vein \nthrombosis (DVT), have been observed in patients taking tofacitinib. A dose dependent increased risk for \nVTE was observed in a clinical study with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors (see sections 4.8 and \n5.1). \n \nTofacitnib should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for VTE, regardless of \nindication and dosage.  \n \nTofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for maintenance treatment is not recommended in patients with UC who \nhave known VTE risk factors, unless there is no suitable alternative treatment available (see section 4.2).  \n \nVTE risk factors include previous VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, myocardial \ninfarction (within previous 3 months), heart failure, use of combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone \nreplacement therapy, inherited coagulation disorder, malignancy. Additional VTE risk factors such as age, \nobesity (BMI \u226530), diabetes, hypertension, smoking status should also be considered. Patients should be \nre-evaluated periodically during tofacitinib treatment to assess for changes in VTE risk. \n \nPromptly evaluate patients with signs and symptoms of VTE and discontinue tofacitinib in patients with \nsuspected VTE, regardless of dose or indication. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other \nopportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving tofacitinib. The risk of opportunistic \ninfections is higher in Asian geographic regions (see section 4.8). Rheumatoid arthritis patients taking \ncorticosteroids may be predisposed to infection. \n \nTofacitinib should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including localised infections. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nThe risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating tofacitinib in patients: \n\u2022 with recurrent infections, \n\u2022 with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection, \n\u2022 who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic mycoses,  \n\u2022 who have underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection, \n\u2022 who are over 65 years of age \n\n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and \nafter treatment with tofacitinib. Treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection, \nan opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with \ntofacitinib should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an \nimmunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should \nbe closely monitored. \n \nAs there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly and in the diabetic populations in general, \ncaution should be used when treating the elderly and patients with diabetes (see section 4.8). In patients \nover 65 years of age tofacitinib should only be considered if no suitable alternative treatment is available \n(see section 5.1). \n \nRisk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be \ngiven to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Discontinuation and \nmonitoring criteria for lymphopenia are discussed in section 4.2. \n \nTuberculosis \n \nThe risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating tofacitinib in patients: \n\n\u2022 who have been exposed to TB, \n\u2022 who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB. \n\n \nPatients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active infection prior to and per applicable guidelines \nduring administration of tofacitinib. \n \nPatients with latent TB, who test positive, should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy \nbefore administering tofacitinib. \n \nAntituberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to administration of tofacitinib in patients who \ntest negative for TB but who have a past history of latent or active TB and where an adequate course of \ntreatment cannot be confirmed; or those who test negative but who have risk factors for TB infection. \nConsultation with a healthcare professional with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in \nthe decision about whether initiating antituberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients \nwho tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy. \n \nViral reactivation \n \nViral reactivation and cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster) were observed in clinical \nstudies with tofacitinib. In patients treated with tofacitinib, the incidence of herpes zoster appears to be \nincreased in:  \n\n\u2022 Japanese or Korean patients.  \n\u2022 Patients with an ALC less than 1,000 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n\u2022 Patients with long standing RA who have previously received two or more biological disease \n\nmodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  \n\u2022 Patients treated with 10 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nThe impact of tofacitinib on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients screened positive for \nhepatitis B or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in \naccordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with tofacitinib. \n \nMalignancy and lymphoproliferative disorder \n \nThe risks and benefits of tofacitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients \nwith current or a history of malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer \n(NMSC) or when considering continuing tofacitinib in patients who develop a malignancy. The possibility \nexists for tofacitinib to affect host defences against malignancies. \n \nLymphomas have been observed in patients treated with tofacitinib. Patients with RA, particularly those \nwith highly active disease may be at a higher risk (up to several-fold) than the general population for the \ndevelopment of lymphoma. The effect of tofacitinib on the development of lymphoma is uncertain. \n \nOther malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting, including, but not \nlimited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. \n \nThe effect of tofacitinib on the development and course of malignancies is not known. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n \nNMSCs have been reported in patients treated with tofacitinib. The risk of NMSC may be higher in \npatients treated with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily than in patients treated with 5 mg twice daily. Periodic \nskin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer (see Table 6 in \nsection 4.8). \n \nInterstitial lung disease  \n \nCaution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease as they may be more prone \nto infections. Events of interstitial lung disease (some of which had a fatal outcome) have been reported in \npatients treated with tofacitinib in RA clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting although the role of \nJanus kinase (JAK) inhibition in these events is not known. Asian RA patients are known to be at higher \nrisk of interstitial lung disease, thus caution should be exercised in treating these patients. \n \nGastrointestinal perforations \n \nEvents of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials although the role of JAK \ninhibition in these events is not known. Tofacitinib should be used with caution in patients who may be at \nincreased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis, patients with \nconcomitant use of corticosteroids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Patients presenting with \nnew onset abdominal signs and symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early identification of \ngastrointestinal perforation. \n \nCardiovascular risk \n \nRA and PsA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with tofacitinib \nshould have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \nLiver enzymes \n \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation in some \npatients (see section 4.8 liver enzyme tests). Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of \ntofacitinib treatment in patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), particularly when initiated in combination with potentially hepatotoxic medicinal \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nproducts such as MTX. Following initiation, routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of \nthe causes of any observed liver enzyme elevations are recommended to identify potential cases of drug-\ninduced liver injury. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of tofacitinib should be \ninterrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIn post-marketing experience, cases of drug hypersensitivity associated with tofacitinib administration \nhave been reported. Allergic reactions included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. \nIf any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, tofacitinib should be discontinued immediately. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nLymphocytes \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of lymphopenia compared to \nplacebo. Lymphocyte counts less than 750 cells/mm3 were associated with an increased incidence of \nserious infections. It is not recommended to initiate or continue tofacitinib treatment in patients with a \nconfirmed lymphocyte count less than 750 cells/mm3. Lymphocytes should be monitored at baseline and \nevery 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts, see section 4.2. \n \nNeutrophils \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than \n2,000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. It is not recommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in patients \nwith an ANC less than 1,000 cells/mm3. ANC should be monitored at baseline and after 4 to 8 weeks of \ntreatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC, see section 4.2. \n \nHaemoglobin \nTreatment with tofacitinib has been associated with decreases in haemoglobin levels. It is not \nrecommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in patients with a haemoglobin value less than 9 g/dL. \nHaemoglobin should be monitored at baseline and after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months \nthereafter. For recommended modifications based on haemoglobin level, see section 4.2. \n \nLipid monitoring \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects \nwere generally observed within 6 weeks. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed after \n8 weeks following initiation of tofacitinib therapy. Patients should be managed according to clinical \nguidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia. Increases in total and LDL cholesterol associated with \ntofacitinib may be decreased to pretreatment levels with statin therapy. \n \nVaccinations \n \nPrior to initiating tofacitinib, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all \nimmunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines. It is recommended that live vaccines \nnot be given concurrently with tofacitinib. The decision to use live vaccines prior to tofacitinib treatment \nshould take into account the pre-existing immunosuppression in a given patient. \n \nProphylactic zoster vaccination should be considered in accordance with vaccination guidelines. Particular \nconsideration should be given to patients with longstanding RA who have previously received two or \nmore biological DMARDs. If live zoster vaccine is administered; it should only be administered to \npatients with a known history of chickenpox or those that are seropositive for varicella zoster virus (VZV). \nIf the history of chickenpox is considered doubtful or unreliable it is recommended to test for antibodies \nagainst VZV. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nVaccination with live vaccines should occur at least 2 weeks but preferably 4 weeks prior to initiation of \ntofacitinib or in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunomodulatory medicinal \nproducts. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines to patients \nreceiving tofacitinib. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to influence the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tofacitinib \n \nSince tofacitinib is metabolised by CYP3A4, interaction with medicinal products that inhibit or induce \nCYP3A4 is likely. Tofacitinib exposure is increased when coadministered with potent inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) or when administration of one or more concomitant medicinal products \nresults in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., fluconazole) (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nTofacitinib exposure is decreased when coadministered with potent CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin). \nInhibitors of CYP2C19 alone or P-glycoprotein are unlikely to significantly alter the PK of tofacitinib. \n \nCoadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), fluconazole (moderate CYP3A4 and \npotent CYP2C19 inhibitor), tacrolimus (mild CYP3A4 inhibitor) and ciclosporine (moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitor) increased tofacitinib AUC, while rifampicin (potent CYP inducer) decreased tofacitinib AUC. \nCoadministration of tofacitinib with potent CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin) may result in a loss of or \nreduced clinical response (see Figure 1). Coadministration of potent inducers of CYP3A4 with tofacitinib \nis not recommended. Coadministration with ketoconazole and fluconazole increased tofacitinib Cmax, \nwhile tacrolimus, ciclosporine and rifampicin decreased tofacitinib Cmax. Concomitant administration with \nMTX 15-25 mg once weekly had no effect on the PK of tofacitinib in RA patients (see Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nFigure 1. Impact of other medicinal products on PK of tofacitinib \n\nNote: Reference group is administration of tofacitinib alone. \na Tofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg twice daily in patients receiving 10 mg twice daily. Tofacitinib dose should be \n\nreduced to 5 mg once daily in patients receiving 5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). \n \nPotential for tofacitinib to influence the PK of other medicinal products \n \nCoadministration of tofacitinib did not have an effect on the PK of oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel and \nethinyl estradiol, in healthy female volunteers. \n \nIn RA patients, coadministration of tofacitinib with MTX 15-25 mg once weekly decreased the AUC and \nCmax of MTX by 10% and 13%, respectively. The extent of decrease in MTX exposure does not warrant \nmodifications to the individualised dosing of MTX. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of tofacitinib in pregnant women. Tofacitinib \nhas been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and to affect parturition and peri/postnatal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, the use of tofacitinib during pregnancy is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with \ntofacitinib and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose. \n \n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC CYP3A Inhibitor Ketoconaz\n\nl  \n\nCYP3A & CYP2C19 \nInhibitor Fluconazole \n\nCYP Inducer \nRifampicin \n\nMethotrexate \n\nTacrolimus \n\nCiclosporine \n\nTofacitinib dose should be reduced a \n \n\nTofacitinib dose should be reduced a \n \n\nEfficacy may be decreased \n\nNo dose adjustment \n\nCombined use of tofacitinib with  \ntacrolimus should be avoided \n\nCombined use of tofacitinib with  \n ciclosporine should be avoided \n\nRatio relative to reference \n\nCoadminist\n Drug \n\nPK  Ratio and 90% CI Recommendation \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether tofacitinib is secreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. Tofacitinib was secreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, the use of tofacitinib during breast-feeding is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nFormal studies of the potential effect on human fertility have not been conducted. Tofacitinib impaired \nfemale fertility but not male fertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTofacitinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections (see section 4.4). The most common \nserious infections reported with tofacitinib were pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract \ninfection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Among opportunistic infections, TB and other mycobacterial \ninfections, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, oesophageal candidiasis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, \ncytomegalovirus, BK virus infections and listeriosis were reported with tofacitinib. Some patients have \npresented with disseminated rather than localised disease. Other serious infections that were not reported \nin clinical studies may also occur (e.g., coccidioidomycosis). \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials were \nheadache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, nausea and hypertension (see \nTable 6, Adverse Drug Reactions [ADRs] based on all study durations). \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during first 3 months of \nthe double-blind, placebo or MTX controlled studies was 3.8% for patients taking tofacitinib. The most \ncommon infections resulting in discontinuation of therapy were herpes zoster and pneumonia. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nOverall, the safety profile observed in patients with active PsA treated with tofacitinib was consistent with \nthe safety profile observed in patients with RA treated with tofacitinib. \n \nUlcerative colitis \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily in the \ninduction studies were headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and arthralgia.  \n \nIn the induction and maintenance studies, across tofacitinib and placebo treatment groups, the most \ncommon categories of serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders and infections, and the \nmost common serious adverse reaction was worsening of UC. \n \nOverall, the safety profile observed in patients with UC treated with tofacitinib was consistent with the \nsafety profile of tofacitinib in the RA indication. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe ADRs listed in the table below are from clinical studies in patients with RA, PsA, and UC and are \npresented by System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency categories, defined using the following \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nconvention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).

The incidence rates (95% CI) for PE \nfor tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 0.54 (0.32-0.87), \n0.27 (0.12-0.52), and 0.09 (0.02-0.26)\u202fpatients with events per 100\u202fpatient-years, respectively. Compared \nwith TNF inhibitors, the hazard ratio (HR) for PE was 5.96 (1.75-20.33) and 2.99 (0.81-11.06) for \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, respectively (see section 5.1).  \n \nIn a subgroup analysis in patients with VTE risk factors in the above-mentioned study, the risk for PE was \nfurther increased. Compared with TNF inhibitors, the HR for PE was 9.14 (2.11-39.56) for tofacitinib \n10 mg twice daily and 3.92 (0.83-18.48) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) \nIn the UC ongoing extension trial, cases of PE and DVT have been observed in patients using tofacitinib \n10 mg twice daily and with underlying VTE risk factor(s). \n \nOverall infections \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nIn controlled phase 3 clinical studies, the rates of infections over 0-3 months in the 5 mg twice daily (total \n616 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (total 642 patients) tofacitinib monotherapy groups were 16.2% \n(100 patients) and 17.9% (115 patients), respectively, compared to 18.9% (23 patients) in the placebo \ngroup (total 122 patients). In controlled phase 3 clinical studies with background DMARDs, the rates of \ninfections over 0-3 months in the 5 mg twice daily (total 973 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (total \n969 patients) tofacitinib plus DMARD group were 21.3% (207 patients) and 21.8% (211 patients), \nrespectively, compared to 18.4% (103 patients) in the placebo plus DMARD group (total 559 patients). \n \nThe most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis (3.7% \nand 3.2%, respectively). \n \nThe overall incidence rate of infections with tofacitinib in the long-term safety all exposure population \n(total 4,867 patients) was 46.1 patients with events per 100 patient-years (43.8 and 47.2 patients with \nevents for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively). For patients (total 1,750) on monotherapy, the rates \nwere 48.9 and 41.9 patients with events per 100 patient-years for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, \nrespectively. For patients (total 3,117) on background DMARDs, the rates were 41.0 and 50.3 patients \nwith events per 100 patient-years for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \n \nUlcerative colitis \nIn the randomised 8-week Phase 2/3 induction studies, the proportions of patients with infections were \n21.1% (198 patients) in the tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily group compared to 15.2% (43 patients) in the \nplacebo group. In the randomised 52-week phase 3 maintenance study, the proportion of patients with \ninfections were 35.9% (71 patients) in the 5 mg twice daily and 39.8% (78 patients) in the 10 mg twice \ndaily tofacitinib groups, compared to 24.2% (48 patients) in the placebo group.  \n \nIn the entire treatment experience with tofacitinib, the most commonly reported infection was \nnasopharyngitis, occurring in 18.2% of patients (211 patients).  \n \nIn the entire treatment experience with tofacitinib, the overall incidence rate of infections was 60.3 events \nper 100 patient-years (involving 49.4% of patients; total 572 patients).  \n \nSerious infections \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nIn the 6-month and 24-month, controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections in the 5 mg twice \ndaily tofacitinib monotherapy group was 1.7 patients with events per 100 patient-years. In the 10 mg twice \ndaily tofacitinib monotherapy group the rate was 1.6 patients with events per 100 patient-years, the rate \nwas 0 events per 100 patient-years for the placebo group, and the rate was 1.9 patients with events per \n100 patient-years for the MTX group. \n \nIn studies of 6-, 12-, or 24-month duration, the rates of serious infections in the 5 mg twice daily and \n10 mg twice daily tofacitinib plus DMARD groups were 3.6 and 3.4 patients with events per 100 patient-\nyears, respectively, compared to 1.7 patients with events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus \nDMARD group. \n\nIn the long-term safety all exposure population, the overall rates of serious infections were 2.4 and \n3.0 patients with events per 100 patient-years for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily tofacitinib groups, \nrespectively. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, herpes zoster, urinary tract \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\ninfection, cellulitis, gastroenteritis and diverticulitis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported \n(see section 4.4). \n \nUlcerative colitis \nThe incidence rates and types of serious infections in the UC clinical studies were generally similar to \nthose reported in RA clinical studies with tofacitinib monotherapy treatment groups. \n \nSerious infections in the elderly \nOf the 4,271 patients who enrolled in RA studies I-VI (see section 5.1), a total of 608 RA patients were \n65 years of age and older, including 85 patients 75 years and older. The frequency of serious infection \namong tofacitinib-treated patients 65 years of age and older was higher than those under the age of 65 (4.8 \nper 100 patient-years versus 2.4 per 100 patient-years, respectively). \n \nAs there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used \nwhen treating the elderly (see section 4.4).  \n \nViral reactivation \n \nPatients treated with tofacitinib who are Japanese or Korean, or patients with long standing RA who have \npreviously received two or more biological DMARDs, or patients with an ALC less than 1,000 cells/mm3, \nor patients treated with 10 mg twice daily may have an increased risk of herpes zoster (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nLymphocytes \nIn the controlled RA clinical studies, confirmed decreases in ALC below 500 cells/mm3 occurred in 0.3% \nof patients and for ALC between 500 and 750 cells/mm3 in 1.9% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and \n10 mg twice daily doses combined. \n \nIn the RA long-term safety population, confirmed decreases in ALC below 500 cells/mm3 occurred in \n1.3% of patients and for ALC between 500 and 750 cells/mm3 in 8.4% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily \nand 10 mg twice daily doses combined. \n \nConfirmed ALC less than 750 cells/mm3 were associated with an increased incidence of serious infections \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIn the clinical studies in UC, changes in ALC observed with tofacitinib treatment were similar to the \nchanges observed in clinical studies in RA. \n \nNeutrophils \nIn the controlled RA clinical studies, confirmed decreases in ANC below 1,000 cells/mm3 occurred in \n0.08% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily doses combined. There were no \nconfirmed decreases in ANC below 500 cells/mm3 observed in any treatment group. There was no clear \nrelationship between neutropenia and the occurrence of serious infections. \n \nIn the RA long-term safety population, the pattern and incidence of confirmed decreases in ANC remained \nconsistent with what was seen in the controlled clinical studies (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the clinical studies in UC, changes in ANC observed with tofacitinib treatment were similar to the \nchanges observed in clinical studies in RA. \n \nLiver enzyme tests \nConfirmed increases in liver enzymes greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (3x ULN) were \nuncommonly observed in RA patients. In those patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nof treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tofacitinib, or \nreduction in tofacitinib dose, resulted in decrease or normalisation of liver enzymes. \n \nIn the controlled portion of the RA phase 3 monotherapy study (0-3 months) (study I, see section 5.1), \nALT elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in 1.65%, 0.41%, and 0% of patients receiving \nplacebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In this study, AST elevations greater than \n3x ULN were observed in 1.65%, 0.41% and 0% of patients receiving placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg \ntwice daily, respectively. \n \nIn the RA phase 3 monotherapy study (0-24 months) (study VI, see section 5.1), ALT elevations greater \nthan 3x ULN were observed in 7.1%, 3.0%, and 3.0% of patients receiving MTX, tofacitinib 5 mg and \n10 mg twice daily, respectively. In this study, AST elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in \n3.3%, 1.6% and 1.5% of patients receiving MTX, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \n \nIn the controlled portion of the RA phase 3 studies on background DMARDs (0-3 months) (studies II-V, \nsee section 5.1), ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in 0.9%, 1.24% and 1.14% of \npatients receiving placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In these studies, AST \nelevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in 0.72%, 0.5% and 0.31% of patients receiving placebo, \ntofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \n \nIn the RA long-term extension studies, on monotherapy, ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN were \nobserved in 1.1% and 1.4% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \nAST elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in < 1.0% in both the tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg \ntwice daily groups. \n \nIn the RA long-term extension studies, on background DMARDs, ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN \nwere observed in 1.8% and 1.6% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, \nrespectively. AST elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in < 1.0% in both the tofacitinib 5 mg \nand 10 mg twice daily groups.  \n \nIn the clinical studies in UC, changes in liver enzyme tests observed with tofacitinib treatment were \nsimilar to the changes observed in clinical studies in RA.  \n \nLipids \nElevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were \nfirst assessed at 1 month following initiation of tofacitinib in the controlled double-blind clinical trials of \nRA. Increases were observed at this time point and remained stable thereafter. \n \nChanges in lipid parameters from baseline through the end of the study (6-24 months) in the controlled \nclinical studies in RA are summarised below: \n \n\u2022 Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily arm and 20% in the \n\ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 12, and increased by 16% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice \ndaily arm and 19% in the tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 24. \n\n\u2022 Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 17% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily arm and 18% in the \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 12, and increased by 19% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice \ndaily arm and 20% in the tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 24. \n\n \nUpon withdrawal of tofacitinib treatment, lipid levels returned to baseline. \n \nMean LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios and Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)/ApoA1 ratios were \nessentially unchanged in tofacitinib-treated patients. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nIn an RA controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment \nlevels in response to statin therapy. \n \nIn the RA long-term safety populations, elevations in the lipid parameters remained consistent with what \nwas seen in the controlled clinical studies. \n \nIn the clinical studies in UC, changes in lipids observed with tofacitinib treatment were similar to the \nchanges observed in clinical studies in RA. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse \nreactions. There is no specific antidote for overdose with tofacitinib. Treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. \n \nPharmacokinetic data up to and including a single dose of 100 mg in healthy volunteers indicate that more \nthan 95% of the administered dose is expected to be eliminated within 24 hours. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic groups: Immunosuppressants, Selective Immunosuppressants; ATC code: L04AA29 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the JAK family. In enzymatic assays, tofacitinib inhibits \nJAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent TyK2. In contrast, tofacitinib has a high degree of selectivity \nagainst other kinases in the human genome. In human cells, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling by \nheterodimeric cytokine receptors that associate with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over \ncytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2. Inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 by tofacitinib attenuates \nsignalling of interleukins (IL-2, -4, -6, -7, -9, -15, -21) and type I and type II interferons, which will result \nin modulation of the immune and inflammatory response. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn patients with RA, treatment up to 6 months with tofacitinib was associated with dose-dependent \nreductions of circulating CD16/56+ natural killer (NK) cells, with estimated maximum reductions \noccurring at approximately 8-10 weeks after initiation of therapy. These changes generally resolved within \n2-6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with tofacitinib was associated with dose-\ndependent increases in B cell counts. Changes in circulating T-lymphocyte counts and T-lymphocyte \nsubsets (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) were small and inconsistent. \n \nFollowing long-term treatment (median duration of tofacitinib treatment of approximately 5 years), CD4+ \nand CD8+ counts showed median reductions of 28% and 27%, respectively, from baseline. In contrast to \nthe observed decrease after short-term dosing, CD16/56+ natural killer cell counts showed a median \nincrease of 73% from baseline. CD19+ B cell counts showed no further increases after long-term \ntofacitinib treatment. All these lymphocyte subset changes returned toward baseline after temporary \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment. There was no evidence of a relationship between serious or opportunistic \ninfections or herpes zoster and lymphocyte subset counts (see section 4.2 for absolute lymphocyte count \nmonitoring). \n \nChanges in total serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels over 6-month tofacitinib dosing in patients with RA were \nsmall, not dose-dependent and similar to those seen on placebo, indicating a lack of systemic humoral \nsuppression. \n \nAfter treatment with tofacitinib in RA patients, rapid decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were \nobserved and maintained throughout dosing. Changes in CRP observed with tofacitinib treatment do not \nreverse fully within 2 weeks after discontinuation, indicating a longer duration of pharmacodynamic \nactivity compared to the half-life. \n \nVaccine studies \n \nIn a controlled clinical trial of patients with RA initiating tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily or placebo, the \nnumber of responders to influenza vaccine was similar in both groups: tofacitinib (57%) and placebo \n(62%). For pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine the number of responders was as follows: 32% in \npatients receiving both tofacitinib and MTX; 62% for tofacitinib monotherapy; 62% for MTX \nmonotherapy; and 77% for placebo. The clinical significance of this is unknown, however, similar results \nwere obtained in a separate vaccine study with influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in \npatients receiving long-term tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily. \n \nA controlled study was conducted in patients with RA on background MTX immunised with a live \nattenuated virus vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) 2 to 3 weeks before initiating a 12-week treatment with tofacitinib \n5 mg twice daily or placebo. Evidence of humoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV was observed in \nboth tofacitinib and placebo-treated patients at 6 weeks. These responses were similar to those observed in \nhealthy volunteers aged 50 years and older. A patient with no previous history of varicella infection and \nno anti-varicella antibodies at baseline experienced dissemination of the vaccine strain of varicella \n16 days after vaccination. Tofacitinib was discontinued and the patient recovered after treatment with \nstandard doses of antiviral medication.

The co-primary endpoints are adjudicated malignancy (excluding NMSC) and \nadjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); cumulative incidence and statistical assessment \nof endpoints are blinded. The study is an event-powered study that also requires at least 1500 patients to \nbe followed for 3 years. The study treatment of tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily has been stopped and \npatients were switched to 5 mg twice daily because of a dose-dependent signal of venous thromboembolic \nevents (VTE). \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) \nIn an interim analysis of study A3921133, an increased and dose-dependent incidence of VTE was \nobserved in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors (see section 4.8). The majority of \nthese events were serious and some cases of PE resulted in death. The incidence rates (95% CI) for PE for \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 0.54 (0.32-0.87), \n0.27 (0.12-0.52), and 0.09 (0.02-0.26) patients with events per 100\u202fpatient-years, respectively. Compared \nwith TNF inhibitors, the HR for PE with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily was 5.96 (1.75-20.33), and for 5 mg \ntwice daily the HR was 2.99 (0.81-11.06). The incidence rates (95% CI) for DVT for tofacitinib 10 mg \ntwice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 0.38 (0.20-0.67), 0.30 (0.14-0.55), and \n0.18\u202f(0.07-0.39) patients with events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Compared with TNF inhibitors, \nthe HR for DVT with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily was 2.13 (0.80-5.69), and for 5 mg twice daily the HR \nwas 1.66 (0.60-4.57). \n \nMortality \nIn an interim analysis of study A3921133, increased mortality within 28 days of last treatment was \nobserved in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. The incidence rates (95% CI) \nwere 0.89 (0.59-1.29) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 0.57 (0.34-0.89) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, \nand 0.27 (0.12-0.51) for TNF-inhibitors; with a HR (95% CI) of 3.28 (1.55-6.95) for tofacitinib 10 mg \ntwice daily and of 2.11 (0.96-4.67) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, versus TNF inhibitors. Mortality was \nmainly due to cardiovascular events, infections and malignancies.  \n\nFor cardiovascular mortality within 28 days of last treatment, the incidence rates (95% CI) per \n100 patients-years were 0.45 (0.24-0.75) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 0.24 (0.10-0.47) for tofacitinib \n5 mg twice daily, and 0.21 (0.08-0.43) for TNF inhibitors; with an incident rate ratio (IRR) (95% CI) of \n2.12 (0.80-6.20) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and of 1.14 (0.36-3.70) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, \nversus TNF inhibitors.  \n\nFor fatal infections within 28 days of last treatment, the incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% CI) \nwere 0.22 (0.09-0.46), 0.18 (0.07-0.39), and 0.06 (0.01-0.22) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and 5 mg \ntwice daily, and TNF inhibitors, respectively; with an IRR (95% CI) of 3.70 (0.71-36.5) for 10 mg twice \ndaily and of 3.00 (0.54-30.4) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, versus TNF inhibitors. \n \nSerious infections \nFor non-fatal serious infections, the incidence rates (95% CI) per 100 patient-years were 3.51 (2.93-4.16), \n3.35 (2.78-4.01), and 2.79 (2.28-3.39), for tofacitinib 10 mg and 5 mg twice daily and TNF inhibitors, \nrespectively. The risk of serious (fatal and non-fatal) infections was further increased in patients over 65 \nyears of age, as compared to younger patients in study A3921133. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of tofacitinib were assessed in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nPhase 3 studies in adult patients with active PsA (\u2265 3 swollen and \u2265 3 tender joints). Patients were \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nrequired to have active plaque psoriasis at the screening visit. For both studies, the primary endpoints were \nACR20 response rate and change from baseline in HAQ-DI at month 3. \n \nStudy PsA-I (OPAL BROADEN) evaluated 422 patients who had a previous inadequate response (due to \nlack of efficacy or intolerance) to a csDMARD (MTX for 92.7% of patients); 32.7% of the patients in this \nstudy had a previous inadequate response to > 1 csDMARD or 1 csDMARD and a targeted synthetic \nDMARD (tsDMARD). In OPAL BROADEN, previous treatment with TNF inhibitor was not allowed. All \npatients were required to have 1 concomitant csDMARD; 83.9% of patients received concomitant MTX, \n9.5% of patients received concomitant sulfasalazine, and 5.7% of patients received concomitant \nleflunomide. The median PsA disease duration was 3.8 years. At baseline, 79.9% and 56.2% of patients \nhad enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively. Patients randomised to tofacitinib received 5 mg twice daily or \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for 12 months. Patients randomised to placebo were advanced in a blinded \nmanner at month 3 to either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and received \ntreatment until month 12. Patients randomised to adalimumab (active-control arm) received 40 mg \nsubcutaneously every 2 weeks for 12 months. \n \nStudy PsA-II (OPAL BEYOND) evaluated 394 patients who had discontinued a TNF inhibitor due to lack \nof efficacy or intolerance; 36.0% had a previous inadequate response to > 1 biological DMARD. All \npatients were required to have 1 concomitant csDMARD; 71.6% of patients received concomitant MTX, \n15.7% of patients received concomitant sulfasalazine, and 8.6% of patients received concomitant \nleflunomide. The median PsA disease duration was 7.5 years. At baseline, 80.7% and 49.2% of patients \nhad enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively. Patients randomised to tofacitinib received 5 mg twice daily or \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for 6 months. Patients randomised to placebo were advanced in a blinded \nmanner at month 3 to either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and received \ntreatment until month 6.  \n \nSigns and symptoms \nTreatment with tofacitinib resulted in significant improvements in some signs and symptoms of PsA, as \nassessed by the ACR20 response criteria compared to placebo at month 3.

Maintenance of clinical response was defined by a decrease from the induction study (OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE \n\nInduction 2) baseline Mayo score of \u2265 3 points and \u2265 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of \n\u2265 1 point or rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Patients were to be in clinical response at baseline of the maintenance study \nOCTAVE Sustain. \n\ne. Sustained corticosteroid-free remission was defined as being in remission and not taking corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks \nprior to the visit at both week 24 and week 52.  \n\nf.

In the maintenance \nstudy (OCTAVE Sustain), tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily demonstrated \ngreater maintenance of improvement compared to placebo in PCS and MCS scores, and in all 8 domains \nof the SF-36 at week 24 and week 52.  \n \nTofacitinib 10 mg twice daily demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo at \nweek 8 in the total and all 4 domain scores of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) \n(bowel symptoms, systemic function, emotional function, and social function) in the induction studies \n(OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2). In the maintenance study (OCTAVE Sustain), tofacitinib \n5 mg twice daily or tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily demonstrated greater maintenance of improvement \ncompared to placebo in the total and all 4 domain scores of the IBDQ at week 24 and week 52. \n \nImprovements were also observed in the EuroQoL 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) and various domains of the \nWork Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI-UC) questionnaire in both induction and maintenance \nstudies compared to placebo. \n \nOpen-label extension study (OCTAVE Open) \nPatients who did not achieve clinical response in one of the induction studies (OCTAVE Induction 1 or \nOCTAVE Induction 2) after 8 weeks of tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily were allowed to enter an open-label \nextension study (OCTAVE Open). After an additional 8 weeks of tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily in \nOCTAVE Open, 53% (154/293) patients achieved clinical response and 14% (42/293) patients achieved \nremission.  \n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nPatients who achieved clinical response in 1 of the induction studies (OCTAVE Induction 1 or OCTAVE \nInduction 2) with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily but experienced treatment failure after their dose was \nreduced to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or following treatment interruption in OCTAVE Sustain (i.e., were \nrandomised to placebo), had their dose increased to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily in OCTAVE Open. After \n8 weeks on tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily in OCTAVE Open, remission was achieved in 35% (20/58) \npatients who received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily in OCTAVE Sustain and 40% (40/99) patients with \ndose interruption in OCTAVE Sustain. At month 12 in OCTAVE Open, 52% (25/48) and 45% (37/83) of \nthese patients achieved remission, respectively.  \n \nFurthermore, at month 12 of study OCTAVE Open, 74% (48/65) of patients who achieved remission at \nthe end of study OCTAVE Sustain on either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily \nremained in remission while receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit results of studies with tofacitinib in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in ulcerative colitis \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe PK profile of tofacitinib is characterised by rapid absorption (peak plasma concentrations are reached \nwithin 0.5-1 hour), rapid elimination (half-life of ~3 hours) and dose-proportional increases in systemic \nexposure. Steady state concentrations are achieved in 24-48 hours with negligible accumulation after twice \ndaily administration. \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nTofacitinib is well-absorbed, with an oral bioavailability of 74%. Coadministration of tofacitinib with a \nhigh-fat meal resulted in no changes in AUC while Cmax was reduced by 32%. In clinical trials, tofacitinib \nwas administered without regard to meal. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 87 L. Approximately 40% of circulating \ntofacitinib is bound to plasma proteins. Tofacitinib binds predominantly to albumin and does not appear to \nbind to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. Tofacitinib distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nClearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic metabolism and 30% renal excretion \nof the parent drug. The metabolism of tofacitinib is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor \ncontribution from CYP2C19. In a human radiolabelled study, more than 65% of the total circulating \nradioactivity was accounted for by unchanged active substance, with the remaining 35% attributed to \n8 metabolites, each accounting for less than 8% of total radioactivity. All metabolites have been observed \nin animal species and are predicted to have less than 10-fold potency than tofacitinib for JAK1/3 \ninhibition. No evidence of stereo conversion in human samples was detected. The pharmacologic activity \nof tofacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule. In vitro, tofacitinib is a substrate for MDR1, but not for \nbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OATP1B1/1B3, or OCT1/2. \n \nPharmacokinetics in patients \n \nThe enzymatic activity of CYP enzymes is reduced in RA patients due to chronic inflammation. In RA \npatients, the oral clearance of tofacitinib does not vary with time, indicating that treatment with tofacitinib \ndoes not normalise CYP enzyme activity. \n \nPopulation PK analysis in RA patients indicated that systemic exposure (AUC) of tofacitinib in the \nextremes of body weight (40 kg, 140 kg) were similar (within 5%) to that of a 70 kg patient. Elderly \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\npatients 80 years of age were estimated to have less than 5% higher AUC relative to the mean age of \n55 years. Women were estimated to have 7% lower AUC compared to men. The available data have also \nshown that there are no major differences in tofacitinib AUC between White, Black and Asian patients. \nAn approximate linear relationship between body weight and volume of distribution was observed, \nresulting in higher peak (Cmax) and lower trough (Cmin) concentrations in lighter patients. However, this \ndifference is not considered to be clinically relevant. The between-subject variability (percentage \ncoefficient of variation) in AUC of tofacitinib is estimated to be approximately 27%. \n \nResults from population PK analysis in patients with active PsA or moderate to severe UC were consistent \nwith those in patients with RA. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSubjects with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min), \nand severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal impairment had 37%, 43% and 123% higher AUC, \nrespectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function (see section 4.2). In subjects with end-stage \nrenal disease (ESRD), contribution of dialysis to the total clearance of tofacitinib was relatively small. \nFollowing a single dose of 10 mg, mean AUC in subjects with ESRD based on concentrations measured \non a non-dialysis day was approximately 40% (90% confidence intervals: 1.5-95%) higher compared to \nsubjects with normal renal function. In clinical trials, tofacitinib was not evaluated in patients with \nbaseline creatinine clearance values (estimated by Cockroft-Gault equation) less than 40 mL/min (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nSubjects with mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment had 3%, and 65% \nhigher AUC, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In clinical trials, tofacitinib \nwas not evaluated in subjects with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4), or \nin patients screened positive for hepatitis B or C. \n \nDrug interactions \n \nTofacitinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, and CYP3A4) and is not an inhibitor of UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and \nUGT2B7). Tofacitinib is not an inhibitor of MDR1, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT2, OAT1/3, or MRP at clinically \nmeaningful concentrations. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn non-clinical studies, effects were observed on the immune and haematopoietic systems that were \nattributed to the pharmacological properties (JAK inhibition) of tofacitinib. Secondary effects from \nimmunosuppression, such as bacterial and viral infections and lymphoma were observed at clinically \nrelevant doses. Lymphoma was observed in 3 of 8 adult monkeys at 6 or 3 times the clinical tofacitinib \nexposure level (unbound AUC in humans at a dose of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily), and 0 of 14 juvenile \nmonkeys at 5 or 2.5 times the clinical exposure level of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Exposure in monkeys \nat the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the lymphomas was approximately 1 or 0.5 times the \nclinical exposure level of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Other findings at doses exceeding human exposures \nincluded effects on the hepatic and gastrointestinal systems. \n \nTofacitinib is not mutagenic or genotoxic based on the results of a series of in vitro and in vivo tests for \ngene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of tofacitinib was assessed in 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity \nand 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies. Tofacitinib was not carcinogenic in mice at exposures up to 38 or \n19 times the clinical exposure level at 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Benign testicular interstitial (Leydig) \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\ncell tumours were observed in rats: benign Leydig cell tumours in rats are not associated with a risk of \nLeydig cell tumours in humans. Hibernomas (malignancy of brown adipose tissue) were observed in \nfemale rats at exposures greater than or equal to 83 or 41 times the clinical exposure level at 5 mg or \n10 mg twice daily. Benign thymomas were observed in female rats at 187 or 94 times the clinical exposure \nlevel at 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. \n \nTofacitinib was shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and have effects in rats on female fertility \n(decreased pregnancy rate; decreases in the numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, and viable \nfoetuses; and an increase in early resorptions), parturition, and peri/postnatal development. Tofacitinib had \nno effects on male fertility, sperm motility or sperm concentration. Tofacitinib was secreted in milk of \nlactating rats at concentrations approximately 2-fold those in serum from 1 to 8 hours postdose. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nTofacitinib in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe \nactive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are \nintolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Tofacitinib can be given as monotherapy \nin case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is one 11 mg prolonged-release tablet administered once daily, which should not \nbe exceeded. \n \nSwitching between tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets and tofacitinib 5mg film-coated tablets \nPatients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily may be switched to tofacitinib 11 mg \nprolonged-release tablets once daily on the day following the last dose of tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated \ntablets.  \n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nPatients treated with tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets once daily may be switched to tofacitinib \n5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily on the day following the last dose of tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-\nrelease tablets. \n \nTofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets once daily has demonstrated pharmacokinetic equivalence \n(AUC and Cmax) to tofacitinib 5 mg film-coated tablets twice daily.  \n \nDose adjustment  \nNo dose adjustment is required when used in combination with MTX. \n \nDose interruption and discontinuation  \n \nTofacitinib treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is \ncontrolled. \n \nInterruption of dosing may be needed for management of dose-related laboratory abnormalities including \nlymphopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. As described in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below, recommendations for \ntemporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of treatment are made according to the severity \nof laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended not to initiate dosing in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than \n750 cells/mm3. \n \nTable 1: Low absolute lymphocyte count \n\nLow absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (see section 4.4) \nLab value \n(cells/mm3) \n\nRecommendation \n\nALC greater than or equal \nto 750 \n\nDose should be maintained. \n\nALC 500-750 For persistent (2 sequential values in this range on routine testing) \ndecrease in this range, tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release dosing \nshould be interrupted until ALC is greater than 750.  \n \nWhen ALC is greater than 750, treatment should be resumed as \nclinically appropriate. \n\nALC less than 500 \n \n\nIf lab value confirmed by repeat testing within 7 days, dosing should \nbe discontinued. \n\n \nIt is recommended not to initiate dosing in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than \n1,000 cells/mm3. \n \nTable 2: Low absolute neutrophil count \n\nLow absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (see section 4.4) \nLab Value \n(cells/mm3) \n\nRecommendation \n\nANC greater than 1,000 Dose should be maintained. \nANC 500-1,000 For persistent (2 sequential values in this range on routine testing) \n\ndecreases in this range, tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release dosing \nshould be interrupted until ANC is greater than 1,000. \n \nWhen ANC is greater than 1,000, treatment should be resumed as \nclinically appropriate. \n\nANC less than 500 \n \n\nIf lab value confirmed by repeat testing within 7 days, dosing should \nbe discontinued.  \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\n \nIt is recommended not to initiate dosing in patients with haemoglobin less than 9 g/dL. \n \nTable 3: Low haemoglobin value \n\nLow haemoglobin value (Section 4.4) \nLab Value \n\n(g/dL) \nRecommendation \n\nLess than or equal to 2 g/dL \ndecrease and greater than or \nequal to 9.0 g/dL \n\nDose should be maintained. \n\nGreater than 2 g/dL \ndecrease or less than \n8.0 g/dL \n(confirmed by repeat \ntesting) \n\nDosing should be interrupted until haemoglobin values have \nnormalised. \n\n \nDrug-drug interactions \nTofacitinib total daily dose should be reduced by half in patients receiving potent inhibitors of cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) and in patients receiving 1 or more concomitant medicinal products \nthat result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 as well as potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., \nfluconazole) (see section 4.5). \n \nTofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg film-coated tablet once daily in patients receiving 11 mg \nprolonged-release tablet once daily. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years and older. There are limited data in patients aged \n75 years and older. \n \nHepatic impairment \n  \nTable 4:  Dose adjustment for hepatic impairment  \nHepatic \nimpairment \ncategory \n\nClassification Dose adjustment in hepatic impairment for different \nstrength tablets \n\nMild Child Pugh A No dose adjustment required. \nModerate Child Pugh B Dose should be reduced to 5 mg film-coated tablets once \n\ndaily when the indicated dose in the presence of normal \nhepatic function is 11 mg prolonged-release tablet once \ndaily (see section 5.2). \n\nSevere Child Pugh C Tofacitinib should not be used in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nRenal impairment \n  \nTable 5:  Dose adjustment for renal impairment  \nRenal \nimpairment \ncategory \n\nCreatinine \nclearance \n\nDose adjustment in renal impairment for different \nstrength tablets \n\nMild 50-80 mL/min No dose adjustment required. \nModerate 30-49 mL/min No dose adjustment required. \nSevere (including \npatients \nundergoing \nhaemodialysis) \n\n< 30 mL/min Dose should be reduced to 5 mg film-coated tablet once \ndaily when the indicated dose in the presence of normal \nrenal function is 11 mg prolonged-release tablet once \ndaily (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment should remain on a \nreduced dose even after haemodialysis (see section 5.2). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in children aged 0 to less than 18 years have not been established. \n \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use.  \n \nTofacitinib is given orally with or without food. \n \nTofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets must be taken whole in order to ensure the entire dose is \ndelivered correctly. They must not be crushed, split or chewed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Active tuberculosis (TB), serious infections such as sepsis, or opportunistic infections (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\u2022 Severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\u2022 Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCombination with other therapies \n \nTofacitinib has not been studied and its use should be avoided in combination with biologics such as TNF \nantagonists, interleukin (IL)-1R antagonists, IL-6R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, \nselective co-stimulation modulators and potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-\nmercaptopurine, ciclosporine and tacrolimus because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression \nand increased risk of infection. \n \nThere was a higher incidence of adverse events for the combination of tofacitinib with MTX versus \ntofacitinib as monotherapy in RA clinical studies. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE)  \n \nSerious VTE events including pulmonary embolism (PE), some of which were fatal, and deep vein \nthrombosis (DVT), have been observed in patients taking tofacitinib. A dose dependent increased risk for \nVTE was observed in a clinical study with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors (see sections 4.8 and \n5.1). \n \nTofacitnib should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for VTE, regardless of \nindication and dosage.  \n \nVTE risk factors include previous VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, myocardial \ninfarction (within previous 3 months), heart failure, use of combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone \nreplacement therapy, inherited coagulation disorder, malignancy. Additional VTE risk factors such as age, \nobesity (BMI \u226530), diabetes, hypertension, smoking status should also be considered. Patients should be \nre-evaluated periodically during tofacitinib treatment to assess for changes in VTE risk. \n \nPromptly evaluate patients with signs and symptoms of VTE and discontinue tofacitinib in patients with \nsuspected VTE, regardless of dose or indication. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other \nopportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving tofacitinib. The risk of opportunistic \ninfections is higher in Asian geographic regions (see section 4.8). Rheumatoid arthritis patients taking \ncorticosteroids may be predisposed to infection. \n \nTofacitinib should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including localised infections. \n \nThe risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating tofacitinib in patients: \n\u2022 with recurrent infections, \n\u2022 with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection, \n\u2022 who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic mycoses,  \n\u2022 who have underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection, \n\u2022 who are over 65 years of age \n\n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and \nafter treatment with tofacitinib. Treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection, \nan opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with \ntofacitinib should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an \nimmunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should \nbe closely monitored. \n \nAs there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly and in the diabetic populations in general, \ncaution should be used when treating the elderly and patients with diabetes (see section 4.8). In patients \nover 65 years of age tofacitinib should only be considered if no suitable alternative treatment is available \n(see section 5.1). \n \nRisk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be \ngiven to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Discontinuation and \nmonitoring criteria for lymphopenia are discussed in section 4.2. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nTuberculosis \n \nThe risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating tofacitinib in patients: \n\u2022 who have been exposed to TB, \n\u2022 who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB. \n \nPatients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active infection prior to and per applicable guidelines \nduring administration of tofacitinib. \n \nPatients with latent TB, who test positive, should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy \nbefore administering tofacitinib. \n \nAntituberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to administration of tofacitinib in patients who \ntest negative for TB but who have a past history of latent or active TB and where an adequate course of \ntreatment cannot be confirmed; or those who test negative but who have risk factors for TB infection. \nConsultation with a healthcare professional with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in \nthe decision about whether initiating antituberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients \nwho tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy. \n \nViral reactivation \n \nViral reactivation and cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster) were observed in clinical \nstudies with tofacitinib. In patients treated with tofacitinib, the incidence of herpes zoster appears to be \nincreased in:  \n\u2022 Japanese or Korean patients.  \n\u2022 Patients with an ALC less than 1,000 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n\u2022 Patients with long standing RA who have previously received two or more biological disease \n\nmodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  \n\u2022 Patients treated with 10 mg twice daily. \n \nThe impact of tofacitinib on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients screened positive for \nhepatitis B or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in \naccordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with tofacitinib. \n \nMalignancy and lymphoproliferative disorder \n \nThe risks and benefits of tofacitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients \nwith current or a history of malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer \n(NMSC) or when considering continuing tofacitinib in patients who develop a malignancy. The possibility \nexists for tofacitinib to affect host defences against malignancies. \n \nLymphomas have been observed in patients treated with tofacitinib. Patients with RA, particularly those \nwith highly active disease may be at a higher risk (up to several-fold) than the general population for the \ndevelopment of lymphoma. The effect of tofacitinib on the development of lymphoma is uncertain. \n \nOther malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting, including, but not \nlimited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. \n \nThe effect of tofacitinib on the development and course of malignancies is not known. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n \nNMSCs have been reported in patients treated with tofacitinib. The risk of NMSC may be higher in \npatients treated with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily than in patients treated with 5 mg twice daily. Periodic \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nskin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer (see Table 6 in \nsection 4.8). \n \nInterstitial lung disease  \n \nCaution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease as they may be more prone \nto infections. Events of interstitial lung disease (some of which had a fatal outcome) have been reported in \npatients treated with tofacitinib in RA clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting although the role of \nJanus kinase (JAK) inhibition in these events is not known. Asian RA patients are known to be at higher \nrisk of interstitial lung disease, thus caution should be exercised in treating these patients. \n \nGastrointestinal perforations \n \nEvents of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials although the role of JAK \ninhibition in these events is not known. Tofacitinib should be used with caution in patients who may be at \nincreased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis, patients with \nconcomitant use of corticosteroids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Patients presenting with \nnew onset abdominal signs and symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early identification of \ngastrointestinal perforation. \n \nCardiovascular risk \n \nRA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with tofacitinib should \nhave risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \nLiver enzymes \n \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation in some \npatients (see section 4.8 liver enzyme tests). Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of \ntofacitinib treatment in patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), particularly when initiated in combination with potentially hepatotoxic medicinal \nproducts such as MTX. Following initiation, routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of \nthe causes of any observed liver enzyme elevations are recommended to identify potential cases of drug-\ninduced liver injury. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of tofacitinib should be \ninterrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIn post-marketing experience, cases of drug hypersensitivity associated with tofacitinib administration \nhave been reported. Allergic reactions included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. \nIf any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, tofacitinib should be discontinued immediately. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nLymphocytes \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of lymphopenia compared to \nplacebo. Lymphocyte counts less than 750 cells/mm3 were associated with an increased incidence of \nserious infections. It is not recommended to initiate or continue tofacitinib treatment in patients with a \nconfirmed lymphocyte count less than 750 cells/mm3. Lymphocytes should be monitored at baseline and \nevery 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts (see section 4.2). \n \nNeutrophils \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than \n2,000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. It is not recommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in patients \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nwith an ANC less than 1,000 cells/mm3. ANC should be monitored at baseline and after 4 to 8 weeks of \ntreatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC (see section 4.2). \n \nHaemoglobin \nTreatment with tofacitinib has been associated with decreases in haemoglobin levels. It is not \nrecommended to initiate tofacitinib treatment in patients with a haemoglobin value less than 9 g/dL. \nHaemoglobin should be monitored at baseline and after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months \nthereafter. For recommended modifications based on haemoglobin level (see section 4.2). \n \nLipid monitoring \nTreatment with tofacitinib was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects \nwere generally observed within 6 weeks. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed after \n8 weeks following initiation of tofacitinib therapy. Patients should be managed according to clinical \nguidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia. Increases in total and LDL cholesterol associated with \ntofacitinib may be decreased to pretreatment levels with statin therapy. \n \nVaccinations \n \nPrior to initiating tofacitinib, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all \nimmunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines. It is recommended that live vaccines \nnot be given concurrently with tofacitinib. The decision to use live vaccines prior to tofacitinib treatment \nshould take into account the pre-existing immunosuppression in a given patient. \n \nProphylactic zoster vaccination should be considered in accordance with vaccination guidelines. Particular \nconsideration should be given to patients with longstanding RA who have previously received two or \nmore biological DMARDs. If live zoster vaccine is administered; it should only be administered to \npatients with a known history of chickenpox or those that are seropositive for varicella zoster virus (VZV). \nIf the history of chickenpox is considered doubtful or unreliable it is recommended to test for antibodies \nagainst VZV. \n \nVaccination with live vaccines should occur at least 2 weeks but preferably 4 weeks prior to initiation of \ntofacitinib or in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunomodulatory medicinal \nproducts. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines to patients \nreceiving tofacitinib. \n \nGastrointestinal obstruction with a non-deformable prolonged-release formulation \n \nCaution should be used when administering tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets to patients with \npre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of \nobstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other \nmedicinal products utilising a non-deformable prolonged-release formulation. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nTofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablets contains sorbitol. The additive effect of concomitantly \nadministered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should \nbe taken into account. \n \nThe content of sorbitol in medicinal products for oral use may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal \nproducts for oral use administered concomitantly. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to influence the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tofacitinib \n \nSince tofacitinib is metabolised by CYP3A4, interaction with medicinal products that inhibit or induce \nCYP3A4 is likely. Tofacitinib exposure is increased when coadministered with potent inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) or when administration of one or more concomitant medicinal products \nresults in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., fluconazole) (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nTofacitinib exposure is decreased when coadministered with potent CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin). \nInhibitors of CYP2C19 alone or P-glycoprotein are unlikely to significantly alter the PK of tofacitinib. \n \nCoadministration with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), fluconazole (moderate CYP3A4 and \npotent CYP2C19 inhibitor), tacrolimus (mild CYP3A4 inhibitor) and ciclosporine (moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitor) increased tofacitinib AUC, while rifampicin (potent CYP inducer) decreased tofacitinib AUC. \nCoadministration of tofacitinib with potent CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin) may result in a loss of or \nreduced clinical response (see Figure 1). Coadministration of potent inducers of CYP3A4 with tofacitinib \nis not recommended. Coadministration with ketoconazole and fluconazole increased tofacitinib Cmax, \nwhile tacrolimus, ciclosporine and rifampicin decreased tofacitinib Cmax. Concomitant administration with \nMTX 15-25 mg once weekly had no effect on the PK of tofacitinib in RA patients (see Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1. Impact of other medicinal products on PK of tofacitinib \n\n \n\nNote: Reference group is administration of tofacitinib alone. \na Tofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg (as film-coated  tablet) once daily in patients receiving 11 mg (as prolonged-release \n\ntablet) once daily (see section 4.2). \n \n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC \n\nCmax \nAUC CYP3A Inhibitor Ketoconazole \n\nCYP3A & CYP2C19 Inhibitor \nFluconazole \n\nCYP Inducer \nRifampicin \n\nMethotrexate \n\nTacrolimus \n\nCiclosporine \n\nTofacitinib dose should be reduced a \n \n\nTofacitinib dose should be reduced a \n \n\nEfficacy may be decreased \n\nNo dose adjustment \n\nCombined use of tofacitinib with  \ntacrolimus should be avoided \n\nCombined use of tofacitinib with  \n ciclosporine should be avoided \n\nRatio relative to reference \n\nCoadministered \nDrug \n\nPK  Ratio and 90% CI Recommendation \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nPotential for tofacitinib to influence the PK of other medicinal products \n \nCoadministration of tofacitinib did not have an effect on the PK of oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel and \nethinyl estradiol, in healthy female volunteers. \n \nIn RA patients, coadministration of tofacitinib with MTX 15-25 mg once weekly decreased the AUC and \nCmax of MTX by 10% and 13%, respectively. The extent of decrease in MTX exposure does not warrant \nmodifications to the individualised dosing of MTX. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of tofacitinib in pregnant women. Tofacitinib \nhas been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and to affect parturition and peri/postnatal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, the use of tofacitinib during pregnancy is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with \ntofacitinib and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether tofacitinib is secreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. Tofacitinib was secreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, the use of tofacitinib during breast-feeding is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nFormal studies of the potential effect on human fertility have not been conducted. Tofacitinib impaired \nfemale fertility but not male fertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTofacitinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections (see section 4.4). The most common \nserious infections reported with tofacitinib were pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract \ninfection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Among opportunistic infections, TB and other mycobacterial \ninfections, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, oesophageal candidiasis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, \ncytomegalovirus, BK virus infections and listeriosis were reported with tofacitinib. Some patients have \npresented with disseminated rather than localised disease. Other serious infections that were not reported \nin clinical studies may also occur (e.g., coccidioidomycosis). \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials were \nheadache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, nausea and hypertension (see \nTable 6, Adverse Drug Reactions [ADRs] based on all study durations). \n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during first 3 months of \nthe double-blind, placebo or MTX controlled studies was 3.8% for patients taking tofacitinib. The most \ncommon infections resulting in discontinuation of therapy were herpes zoster and pneumonia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe ADRs listed in the table below are from clinical studies in patients with RA, PsA, and UC and are \npresented by System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency categories, defined using the following \nconvention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).

The incidence rates (95% CI) for PE \nfor tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 0.54 (0.32-0.87), \n0.27 (0.12-0.52), and 0.09 (0.02-0.26)\u202fpatients with events per 100\u202fpatient-years, respectively. Compared \nwith TNF inhibitors, the hazard ratio (HR) for PE was 5.96 (1.75-20.33) and 2.99 (0.81-11.06) for \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, respectively (see section 5.1).  \n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nIn a subgroup analysis in patients with VTE risk factors in the above-mentioned study, the risk for PE was \nfurther increased. Compared with TNF inhibitors, the HR for PE was 9.14 (2.11-39.56) for tofacitinib \n10 mg twice daily and 3.92 (0.83-18.48) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. \n \nOverall infections \n \nIn controlled phase 3 clinical studies, the rates of infections over 0-3 months in the 5 mg film-coated \ntablets twice daily (total 616 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (total 642 patients) tofacitinib monotherapy \ngroups were 16.2% (100 patients) and 17.9% (115 patients), respectively, compared to 18.9% (23 patients) \nin the placebo group (total 122 patients). In controlled phase 3 clinical studies with background DMARDs, \nthe rates of infections over 0-3 months in the 5 mg twice daily (total 973 patients) and 10 mg twice daily \n(total 969 patients) tofacitinib plus DMARD group were 21.3% (207 patients) and 21.8% (211 patients), \nrespectively, compared to 18.4% (103 patients) in the placebo plus DMARD group (total 559 patients). \n \nThe most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis (3.7% \nand 3.2%, respectively). \n \nThe overall incidence rate of infections with tofacitinib in the long-term safety all exposure population \n(total 4,867 patients) was 46.1 patients with events per 100 patient-years (43.8 and 47.2 patients with \nevents for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively). For patients (total 1,750) on monotherapy, the rates \nwere 48.9 and 41.9 patients with events per 100 patient-years for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, \nrespectively. For patients (total 3,117) on background DMARDs, the rates were 41.0 and 50.3 patients \nwith events per 100 patient-years for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \n \nSerious infections \n \nIn the 6-month and 24-month, controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections in the 5 mg twice \ndaily tofacitinib monotherapy group was 1.7 patients with events per 100 patient-years. In the 10 mg twice \ndaily tofacitinib monotherapy group the rate was 1.6 patients with events per 100 patient-years, the rate \nwas 0 events per 100 patient-years for the placebo group, and the rate was 1.9 patients with events per \n100 patient-years for the MTX group. \n \nIn studies of 6-, 12-, or 24-month duration, the rates of serious infections in the 5 mg twice daily and \n10 mg twice daily tofacitinib plus DMARD groups were 3.6 and 3.4 patients with events per 100 patient-\nyears, respectively, compared to 1.7 patients with events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus \nDMARD group. \n\nIn the long-term safety all exposure population, the overall rates of serious infections were 2.4 and \n3.0 patients with events per 100 patient-years for 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily tofacitinib groups, \nrespectively. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, herpes zoster, urinary tract \ninfection, cellulitis, gastroenteritis and diverticulitis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported \n(see section 4.4). \n \nViral reactivation \n \nPatients treated with tofacitinib who are Japanese or Korean, or patients with long standing RA who have \npreviously received two or more biological DMARDs, or patients with an ALC less than 1,000 cells/mm3, \nor patients treated with 10 mg twice daily may have an increased risk of herpes zoster (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nLaboratory tests \n \nLymphocytes \nIn the controlled RA clinical studies, confirmed decreases in ALC below 500 cells/mm3 occurred in 0.3% \nof patients and for ALC between 500 and 750 cells/mm3 in 1.9% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and \n10 mg twice daily doses combined. \n \nIn the RA long-term safety population, confirmed decreases in ALC below 500 cells/mm3 occurred in \n1.3% of patients and for ALC between 500 and 750 cells/mm3 in 8.4% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily \nand 10 mg twice daily doses combined. \n \nConfirmed ALC less than 750 cells/mm3 were associated with an increased incidence of serious infections \n(see section 4.4). \n \nNeutrophils \nIn the controlled RA clinical studies, confirmed decreases in ANC below 1,000 cells/mm3 occurred in \n0.08% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily doses combined. There were no \nconfirmed decreases in ANC below 500 cells/mm3 observed in any treatment group. There was no clear \nrelationship between neutropenia and the occurrence of serious infections. \n \nIn the RA long-term safety population, the pattern and incidence of confirmed decreases in ANC remained \nconsistent with what was seen in the controlled clinical studies (see section 4.4). \n \nLiver enzyme tests \nConfirmed increases in liver enzymes greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (3x ULN) were \nuncommonly observed in RA patients. In those patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification \nof treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tofacitinib, or \nreduction in tofacitinib dose, resulted in decrease or normalisation of liver enzymes. \n \nIn the controlled portion of the RA phase 3 monotherapy study (0-3 months) (study I, see section 5.1), \nALT elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in 1.65%, 0.41%, and 0% of patients receiving \nplacebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In this study, AST elevations greater than \n3x ULN were observed in 1.65%, 0.41% and 0% of patients receiving placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg \ntwice daily, respectively. \n \nIn the RA phase 3 monotherapy study (0-24 months) (study VI, see section 5.1), ALT elevations greater \nthan 3x ULN were observed in 7.1%, 3.0%, and 3.0% of patients receiving MTX, tofacitinib 5 mg and \n10 mg twice daily, respectively. In this study, AST elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in \n3.3%, 1.6% and 1.5% of patients receiving MTX, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \n \nIn the controlled portion of the RA phase 3 studies on background DMARDs (0-3 months) (studies II-V, \nsee section 5.1), ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in 0.9%, 1.24% and 1.14% of \npatients receiving placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In these studies, AST \nelevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in 0.72%, 0.5% and 0.31% of patients receiving placebo, \ntofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \n \nIn the RA long-term extension studies, on monotherapy, ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN were \nobserved in 1.1% and 1.4% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. \nAST elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in < 1.0% in both the tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg \ntwice daily groups. \n \nIn the RA long-term extension studies, on background DMARDs, ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN \nwere observed in 1.8% and 1.6% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, \nrespectively. AST elevations greater than 3x ULN were observed in < 1.0% in both the tofacitinib 5 mg \nand 10 mg twice daily groups.  \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\n \nLipids \nElevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were \nfirst assessed at 1 month following initiation of tofacitinib in the controlled double-blind clinical trials of \nRA. Increases were observed at this time point and remained stable thereafter. \n \nChanges in lipid parameters from baseline through the end of the study (6-24 months) in the controlled \nclinical studies in RA are summarised below: \n \n\u2022 Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily arm and 20% in the \n\ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 12, and increased by 16% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice \ndaily arm and 19% in the tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 24. \n\n\u2022 Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 17% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily arm and 18% in the \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 12, and increased by 19% in the tofacitinib 5 mg twice \ndaily arm and 20% in the tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm at month 24. \n\n \nUpon withdrawal of tofacitinib treatment, lipid levels returned to baseline. \n \nMean LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios and Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)/ApoA1 ratios were \nessentially unchanged in tofacitinib-treated patients. \n \nIn an RA controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment \nlevels in response to statin therapy. \n \nIn the RA long-term safety populations, elevations in the lipid parameters remained consistent with what \nwas seen in the controlled clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse \nreactions. There is no specific antidote for overdose with tofacitinib. Treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. \n \nPharmacokinetic data up to and including a single dose of 100 mg in healthy volunteers indicate that more \nthan 95% of the administered dose is expected to be eliminated within 24 hours. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic groups: Immunosuppressants, Selective Immunosuppressants; ATC code: L04AA29 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the JAK family. In enzymatic assays, tofacitinib inhibits \nJAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent TyK2. In contrast, tofacitinib has a high degree of selectivity \nagainst other kinases in the human genome. In human cells, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling by \nheterodimeric cytokine receptors that associate with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n56 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\ncytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2. Inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 by tofacitinib attenuates \nsignalling of interleukins (IL-2, -4, -6, -7, -9, -15, -21) and type I and type II interferons, which will result \nin modulation of the immune and inflammatory response. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn patients with RA, treatment up to 6 months with tofacitinib was associated with dose-dependent \nreductions of circulating CD16/56+ natural killer (NK) cells, with estimated maximum reductions \noccurring at approximately 8-10 weeks after initiation of therapy. These changes generally resolved within \n2-6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with tofacitinib was associated with dose-\ndependent increases in B cell counts. Changes in circulating T-lymphocyte counts and T-lymphocyte \nsubsets (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) were small and inconsistent. \n \nFollowing long-term treatment (median duration of tofacitinib treatment of approximately 5 years), CD4+ \nand CD8+ counts showed median reductions of 28% and 27%, respectively, from baseline. In contrast to \nthe observed decrease after short-term dosing, CD16/56+ natural killer cell counts showed a median \nincrease of 73% from baseline. CD19+ B cell counts showed no further increases after long-term \ntofacitinib treatment. All these lymphocyte subset changes returned toward baseline after temporary \ndiscontinuation of treatment. There was no evidence of a relationship between serious or opportunistic \ninfections or herpes zoster and lymphocyte subset counts (see section 4.2 for absolute lymphocyte count \nmonitoring). \n \nChanges in total serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels over 6-month tofacitinib dosing in patients with RA were \nsmall, not dose-dependent and similar to those seen on placebo, indicating a lack of systemic humoral \nsuppression. \n \nAfter treatment with tofacitinib in RA patients, rapid decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were \nobserved and maintained throughout dosing. Changes in CRP observed with tofacitinib treatment do not \nreverse fully within 2 weeks after discontinuation, indicating a longer duration of pharmacodynamic \nactivity compared to the half-life. \n \nVaccine studies \n \nIn a controlled clinical trial of patients with RA initiating tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily or placebo, the \nnumber of responders to influenza vaccine was similar in both groups: tofacitinib (57%) and placebo \n(62%). For pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine the number of responders was as follows: 32% in \npatients receiving both tofacitinib and MTX; 62% for tofacitinib monotherapy; 62% for MTX \nmonotherapy; and 77% for placebo. The clinical significance of this is unknown, however, similar results \nwere obtained in a separate vaccine study with influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in \npatients receiving long-term tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily. \n \nA controlled study was conducted in patients with RA on background MTX immunised with a live \nattenuated virus vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) 2 to 3 weeks before initiating a 12-week treatment with tofacitinib \n5 mg twice daily or placebo. Evidence of humoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV was observed in \nboth tofacitinib and placebo-treated patients at 6 weeks. These responses were similar to those observed in \nhealthy volunteers aged 50 years and older. A patient with no previous history of varicella infection and \nno anti-varicella antibodies at baseline experienced dissemination of the vaccine strain of varicella \n16 days after vaccination. Tofacitinib was discontinued and the patient recovered after treatment with \nstandard doses of antiviral medication. This patient subsequently made a robust, though delayed, humoral \nand cellular response to the vaccine (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of tofacitinib were assessed in 6 randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre \nstudies in patients greater than 18 years of age with active RA diagnosed according to American College \nof Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

Patients receiving \neither 5 mg or 10 mg tofacitinib twice daily experienced significantly greater improvement from baseline \ncompared to placebo in all 8 domains as well as the Physical Component Summary and Mental \nComponent Summary scores at month 3 in ORAL Solo, ORAL Scan and ORAL Step. In ORAL Scan, \nmean SF-36 improvements were maintained to 12 months in tofacitinib-treated patients. \n \nImprovement in fatigue was evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue \n(FACIT-F) scale at month 3 in all studies. Patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily \ndemonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline in fatigue compared to placebo in all \n5 studies. In ORAL Standard and ORAL Scan, mean FACIT-F improvements were maintained to \n12 months in tofacitinib-treated patients. \n \nImprovement in sleep was assessed using the Sleep Problems Index I and II summary scales of the \nMedical Outcomes Study Sleep (MOS-Sleep) measure at month 3 in all studies. Patients receiving \ntofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily demonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline in \nboth scales compared to placebo in ORAL Sync, ORAL Standard and ORAL Scan. In ORAL Standard \nand ORAL Scan, mean improvements in both scales were maintained to 12 months in tofacitinib-treated \npatients. \n \nDurability of clinical responses \n \nDurability of effect was assessed by ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 response rates in studies of duration of up \nto two years. Changes in mean HAQ-DI and DAS28-4(ESR) were maintained in both tofacitinib treatment \ngroups through to the end of the studies. \n \nEvidence of persistence of efficacy with tofacitinib treatment for up to 7 years is also provided from data \nin the one ongoing and one completed open-label, long-term follow-up studies. \n \nLong-term controlled safety data \n \nStudy ORAL Surveillance (A3921133) is a large (N=4362), ongoing, randomised active-controlled \npost-authorisation safety surveillance study of rheumatoid arthritis patients who were at least 50 years of \nage and older and had at least one cardiovascular risk factor (CV risk factors defined as: current cigarette \nsmoker, diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of premature coronary heart disease, \nhistory of coronary artery disease including a history of revascularization procedure, coronary artery \nbypass grafting, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, and \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\npresence of extra-articular disease associated with RA, e.g. nodules, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, anemia of \nchronic disease, pulmonary manifestations). \n \nPatients were randomised to open-label tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, or a \nTNF inhibitor (TNF inhibitor was either etanercept 50 mg once weekly or adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The co-primary endpoints are adjudicated malignancy (excluding NMSC) and \nadjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); cumulative incidence and statistical assessment \nof endpoints are blinded. The study is an event-powered study that also requires at least 1500 patients to \nbe followed for 3 years. The study treatment of tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily has been stopped and \npatients were switched to 5 mg twice daily because of a dose-dependent signal of venous thromboembolic \nevents (VTE). \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) \nIn an interim analysis of study A3921133, an increased and dose-dependent incidence of VTE was \nobserved in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors (see section 4.8). The majority of \nthese events were serious and some cases of PE resulted in death. The incidence rates (95% CI) for PE for \ntofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 0.54 (0.32-0.87), \n0.27 (0.12-0.52), and 0.09 (0.02-0.26) patients with events per 100\u202fpatient-years, respectively. Compared \nwith TNF inhibitors, the HR for PE with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily was 5.96 (1.75-20.33), and for 5 mg \ntwice daily the HR was 2.99 (0.81-11.06). The incidence rates (95% CI) for DVT for tofacitinib 10 mg \ntwice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 0.38 (0.20-0.67), 0.30 (0.14-0.55), and \n0.18\u202f(0.07-0.39) patients with events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Compared with TNF inhibitors, \nthe HR for DVT with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily was 2.13 (0.80-5.69), and for 5 mg twice daily the HR \nwas 1.66 (0.60-4.57). \n \nMortality \nIn an interim analysis of study A3921133, increased mortality within 28 days of last treatment was \nobserved in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. The incidence rates (95% CI) \nwere 0.89 (0.59-1.29) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 0.57 (0.34-0.89) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, \nand 0.27 (0.12-0.51) for TNF-inhibitors; with a HR (95% CI) of 3.28 (1.55-6.95) for tofacitinib 10 mg \ntwice daily and of 2.11 (0.96-4.67) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, versus TNF inhibitors. Mortality was \nmainly due to cardiovascular events, infections and malignancies.  \n\nFor cardiovascular mortality within 28 days of last treatment, the incidence rates (95% CI) per \n100 patients-years were 0.45 (0.24-0.75) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 0.24 (0.10-0.47) for tofacitinib \n5 mg twice daily, and 0.21 (0.08-0.43) for TNF inhibitors; with an incident rate ratio (IRR) (95% CI) of \n2.12 (0.80-6.20) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and of 1.14 (0.36-3.70) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, \nversus TNF inhibitors.  \n\nFor fatal infections within 28 days of last treatment, the incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% CI) \nwere 0.22 (0.09-0.46), 0.18 (0.07-0.39), and 0.06 (0.01-0.22) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and 5 mg \ntwice daily, and TNF inhibitors, respectively; with an IRR (95% CI) of 3.70 (0.71-36.5) for 10 mg twice \ndaily and of 3.00 (0.54-30.4) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, versus TNF inhibitors. \n \nSerious infections \nFor non-fatal serious infections, the incidence rates (95% CI) per 100 patient-years were 3.51 (2.93-4.16), \n3.35 (2.78-4.01), and 2.79 (2.28-3.39), for tofacitinib 10 mg and 5 mg twice daily and TNF inhibitors, \nrespectively. The risk of serious (fatal and non-fatal) infections was further increased in patients over 65 \nyears of age, as compared to younger patients in study A3921133. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit results of studies with tofacitinib in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in ulcerative colitis \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing oral administration of tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablet, peak plasma concentrations \nare reached at 4 hours and half-life is ~6 hours. Steady state concentrations are achieved within 48 hours \nwith negligible accumulation after once daily administration. Steady-state AUC and Cmax of tofacitinib for \ntofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablet administered once daily are equivalent to those of tofacitinib \n5 mg film-coated tablets administered twice daily. \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nCoadministration of tofacitinib 11 mg prolonged-release tablet with a high-fat meal resulted in no changes \nin AUC while Cmax was increased by 27%. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 87 L. Approximately 40% of circulating \ntofacitinib is bound to plasma proteins. Tofacitinib binds predominantly to albumin and does not appear to \nbind to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. Tofacitinib distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nClearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic metabolism and 30% renal excretion \nof the parent drug. The metabolism of tofacitinib is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor \ncontribution from CYP2C19. In a human radiolabelled study, more than 65% of the total circulating \nradioactivity was accounted for by unchanged active substance, with the remaining 35% attributed to \n8 metabolites, each accounting for less than 8% of total radioactivity. All metabolites have been observed \nin animal species and are predicted to have less than 10-fold potency than tofacitinib for JAK1/3 \ninhibition. No evidence of stereo conversion in human samples was detected. The pharmacologic activity \nof tofacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule. In vitro, tofacitinib is a substrate for MDR1, but not for \nbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OATP1B1/1B3, or OCT1/2.   \n \nPharmacokinetics in patients \n \nThe enzymatic activity of CYP enzymes is reduced in RA patients due to chronic inflammation. In RA \npatients, the oral clearance of tofacitinib does not vary with time, indicating that treatment with tofacitinib \ndoes not normalise CYP enzyme activity. \n \nPopulation PK analysis in RA patients indicated that systemic exposure (AUC) of tofacitinib in the \nextremes of body weight (40 kg, 140 kg) were similar (within 5%) to that of a 70 kg patient. Elderly \npatients 80 years of age were estimated to have less than 5% higher AUC relative to the mean age of \n55 years. Women were estimated to have 7% lower AUC compared to men. The available data have also \nshown that there are no major differences in tofacitinib AUC between White, Black and Asian patients. \nAn approximate linear relationship between body weight and volume of distribution was observed, \nresulting in higher peak (Cmax) and lower trough (Cmin) concentrations in lighter patients. However, this \ndifference is not considered to be clinically relevant. The between-subject variability (percentage \ncoefficient of variation) in AUC of tofacitinib is estimated to be approximately 27%. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSubjects with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min), \nand severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal impairment had 37%, 43% and 123% higher AUC, \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nrespectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function (see section 4.2). In subjects with end-stage \nrenal disease (ESRD), contribution of dialysis to the total clearance of tofacitinib was relatively small. \nFollowing a single dose of 10 mg, mean AUC in subjects with ESRD based on concentrations measured \non a non-dialysis day was approximately 40% (90% confidence intervals: 1.5-95%) higher compared to \nsubjects with normal renal function. In clinical trials, tofacitinib was not evaluated in patients with \nbaseline creatinine clearance values (estimated by Cockroft-Gault equation) less than 40 mL/min (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nSubjects with mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment had 3%, and 65% \nhigher AUC, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In clinical trials, tofacitinib \nwas not evaluated in subjects with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4), or \nin patients screened positive for hepatitis B or C. \n \nDrug interactions \n \nTofacitinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, and CYP3A4) and is not an inhibitor of UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and \nUGT2B7). Tofacitinib is not an inhibitor of MDR1, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT2, OAT1/3, or MRP at clinically \nmeaningful concentrations. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn non-clinical studies, effects were observed on the immune and haematopoietic systems that were \nattributed to the pharmacological properties (JAK inhibition) of tofacitinib. Secondary effects from \nimmunosuppression, such as bacterial and viral infections and lymphoma were observed at clinically \nrelevant doses. Lymphoma was observed in 3 of 8 adult monkeys at 6 or 3 times the clinical tofacitinib \nexposure level (unbound AUC in humans at a dose of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily), and 0 of 14 juvenile \nmonkeys at 5 or 2.5 times the clinical exposure level of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Exposure in monkeys \nat the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the lymphomas was approximately 1 or 0.5 times the \nclinical exposure level of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Other findings at doses exceeding human exposures \nincluded effects on the hepatic and gastrointestinal systems. \n \nTofacitinib is not mutagenic or genotoxic based on the results of a series of in vitro and in vivo tests for \ngene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of tofacitinib was assessed in 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity \nand 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies. Tofacitinib was not carcinogenic in mice at exposures up to 38 or \n19 times the clinical exposure level at 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. Benign testicular interstitial (Leydig) \ncell tumours were observed in rats: benign Leydig cell tumours in rats are not associated with a risk of \nLeydig cell tumours in humans. Hibernomas (malignancy of brown adipose tissue) were observed in \nfemale rats at exposures greater than or equal to 83 or 41 times the clinical exposure level at 5 mg or \n10 mg twice daily. Benign thymomas were observed in female rats at 187 or 94 times the clinical exposure \nlevel at 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. \n \nTofacitinib was shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and have effects in rats on female fertility \n(decreased pregnancy rate; decreases in the numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, and viable \nfoetuses; and an increase in early resorptions), parturition, and peri/postnatal development. Tofacitinib had \nno effects on male fertility, sperm motility or sperm concentration. Tofacitinib was secreted in milk of \nlactating rats at concentrations approximately 2-fold those in serum from 1 to 8 hours postdose. \n \n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\n6.

What XELJANZ is and what it is used for \n \nXELJANZ is a medicine that contains the active substance tofacitinib.  \n \nXELJANZ is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\u2022 rheumatoid arthritis \n\u2022 psoriatic arthritis \n\u2022 ulcerative colitis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nXELJANZ is used to treat adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, a long-term \ndisease that mainly causes pain and swelling of your joints. \n \nXELJANZ is used together with methotrexate when previous rheumatoid arthritis treatment was not \nsufficient or was not well tolerated. XELJANZ can also be taken on its own in those cases where \nmethotrexate treatment is not tolerated or treatment with methotrexate is not advised. \n \nXELJANZ has been shown to reduce pain and swelling of the joints and improve the ability to perform \ndaily activities, when given on its own or together with methotrexate. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nXELJANZ is used to treat a condition called psoriatic arthritis. This condition is an inflammatory disease \nof the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will be first given \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nanother medicine to treat your psoriatic arthritis. If you do not respond well enough or the medicine is not \ntolerated, you may be given XELJANZ to reduce the sign and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis and \nimprove the ability to perform daily activities.  \n \nXELJANZ is used together with methotrexate to treat adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.  \n \nUlcerative colitis \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large bowel. XELJANZ is used to reduce the signs and \nsymptoms of ulcerative colitis when you did not respond well enough or were intolerant to previous \nulcerative colitis treatment. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take XELJANZ \n\n \nDo not take XELJANZ \n- if you are allergic to tofacitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n- if you have a severe infection such as bloodstream infection or active tuberculosis  \n- if you have been informed that you have severe liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the \n\nliver)  \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n \nIf you are not sure regarding any of the information provided above, please contact your doctor.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking XELJANZ: \n- if you think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as fever, sweating, chills, \n\nmuscle aches, cough, shortness of breath, new phlegm or change in phlegm, weight loss, warm or \nred or painful skin or sores on your body, difficulty or pain when swallowing, diarrhoea or stomach \npain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, feeling very tired \n\n- if you have any condition that increases your chance of infection (e.g., diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or a \nweak immune system) \n\n- if you have any kind of infection, are being treated for any infection, or if you have infections that \nkeep coming back. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. XELJANZ can reduce your \nbody\u2019s ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the \nchance of getting a new infection \n\n- if you have or have a history of tuberculosis or have been in close contact with someone with \ntuberculosis. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before starting XELJANZ and may retest \nduring treatment \n\n- if you have any chronic lung disease \n- if you have liver problems \n- if you have or had hepatitis B or hepatitis C (viruses that affect the liver). The virus may become \n\nactive while you are taking XELJANZ. Your doctor may do blood tests for hepatitis before you start \ntreatment with XELJANZ and while you are taking XELJANZ \n\n- if you have ever had any type of cancer. XELJANZ may increase your risk of certain cancers. \nLymphoma and other cancers (such as lung, breast, melanoma, prostate and pancreatic) have been \nreported in patients treated with XELJANZ. If you develop cancer while taking XELJANZ your \ndoctor will review whether to stop XELJANZ treatment. \n\n- if you are at high risk of developing skin cancer, your doctor may recommend that you have regular \nskin examinations while taking XELJANZ.  \n\n- if you have had diverticulitis (a type of inflammation of the large intestine) or ulcers in stomach or \nintestines (see section 4) \n\n- if you have kidney problems \n- if you are planning to get vaccinated, tell your doctor. Certain types of vaccines should not be given \n\nwhen taking XELJANZ. Before you start XELJANZ, you should be up to date with all \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nrecommended vaccinations. Your doctor will decide whether you need to have herpes zoster \nvaccination.  \n\n- if you have heart problems, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol \n \nThere have been reports of patients treated with XELJANZ who have developed blood clots in the lungs \nor veins. Your doctor will evaluate your risk to develop blood clots in the lungs or veins and determine if \nXELJANZ is appropriate for you. If you have already had problems on developing blood clots in lungs \nand veins or have an increased risk for developing this (for example: if you are seriously overweight, if \nyou have cancer, heart problems, diabetes, experienced a heart attack (within previous 3 months), recent \nmajor surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\\hormonal replacement therapy, if a coagulation defect \nis identified in you or your close relatives), if you are of older age, or if you smoke, your doctor may \ndecide that XELJANZ is not suitable for you. \n \nTalk to your doctor straight away if you develop sudden shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest \npain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or tenderness, or redness or discoloration in \nthe leg or arm while taking XELJANZ, as these may be signs of a clot in the lungs or veins. \n \nAdditional monitoring tests \nYour doctor should perform blood tests before you start taking XELJANZ, and after 4 to 8 weeks of \ntreatment and then every 3 months, to determine if you have a low white blood cell (neutrophil or \nlymphocyte) count, or a low red blood cell count (anaemia).  \n \nYou should not receive XELJANZ if your white blood cell (neutrophil or lymphocyte) count or red blood \ncell count is too low. If needed, your doctor may interrupt your XELJANZ treatment to reduce the risk of \ninfection (white blood cell counts) or anaemia (red blood cell counts). \n \nYour doctor may also perform other tests, for example to check your blood cholesterol levels or monitor \nthe health of your liver. Your doctor should test your cholesterol levels 8 weeks after you start receiving \nXELJANZ. Your doctor should perform liver tests periodically. \n \nElderly \nThere is a higher rate of infections in patients aged 65 years and older. Tell your doctor as soon as you \nnotice any signs or symptoms of infections. \n \nAsian patients \nThere is a higher rate of shingles in Japanese and Korean patients. Tell your doctor if you notice any \npainful blisters on your skin.  \n \nYou may also be at higher risk of certain lung problems. Tell your doctor if you notice any breathing \ndifficulties. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXELJANZ is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. The safety and \nbenefits of XELJANZ in children or adolescents have not yet been established. \n \nOther medicines and XELJANZ \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nSome medicines should not be taken with XELJANZ. If taken with XELJANZ, they could alter the level \nof XELJANZ in your body, and the dose of XELJANZ may require adjustment. You should tell your \ndoctor if you are using medicines (taken by mouth) that contain any of the following active substances: \n\n\u2022 antibiotics such as rifampicin, used to treat bacterial infections \n\u2022 fluconazole, ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nXELJANZ is not recommended for use with medicines that depress the immune system, including \nso-called targeted biologic (antibody) therapies, such as those that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, \ninterleukin-17, interleukin-12/interleukin-23, anti-integrins, and strong chemical immunosuppressants \nincluding azathioprine, mercaptopurine, ciclosporine, and tacrolimus. Taking XELJANZ with these \nmedicines may increase your risk of side effects including infection. \n \nSerious infections may happen more often in people who also take corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use effective birth control during treatment with \nXELJANZ and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before taking this medicine. XELJANZ must not be used during pregnancy. Tell your \ndoctor right away if you become pregnant while taking XELJANZ. \n \nIf you are taking XELJANZ and breast-feeding, you must stop breast-feeding until you talk to your doctor \nabout stopping treatment with XELJANZ. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXELJANZ has no or limited effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nXELJANZ contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3.

Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n\n\u2022 The recommended dose is 5 mg twice a day. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n\n\u2022 The recommended dose is 5 mg twice a day.  \n \nUlcerative colitis \n\u2022 The recommended dose is 10 mg twice a day for 8 weeks, followed by 5 mg twice a day. \n\u2022 Your doctor may decide to extend the initial 10 mg twice a day treatment by an additional 8 weeks \n\n(16 weeks in total), followed by 5 mg twice a day. \n\u2022 Your doctor may decide to stop XELJANZ if XELJANZ does not work for you within 16 weeks. \n\u2022 For patients, who have previously taken biologic medicines to treat ulcerative colitis (such as those \n\nthat block the activity of tumour necrosis factor in the body) and these medicines did not work, the \ndoctor may decide to increase your dose of XELJANZ to 10 mg twice a day if you do not respond \nsufficiently to 5 mg twice a day. Your doctor will consider the potential risks, including that of \ndeveloping blood clots in the lungs or veins, and potential benefits to you. Your doctor will tell you \nif this applies to you. \n\n\u2022 If your treatment is interrupted, your doctor may decide to restart your treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\nClassified as public by the European Medicines Agency \n\nTry to take your tablet at the same time every day (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the \nevening). \n \nTofacitinib tablets may be crushed and taken with water. \n \nYour doctor may reduce the dose if you have liver or kidney problems or if you are prescribed certain \nother medicines. Your doctor may also stop treatment temporarily or permanently if blood tests show low \nwhite blood cell or red blood cell counts.  \n \nXELJANZ is for oral use.

Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. XELJANZ can reduce your \nbody\u2019s ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the \nchance of getting a new infection \n\n- if you have or have a history of tuberculosis or have been in close contact with someone with \ntuberculosis. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before starting XELJANZ and may retest \nduring treatment \n\n- if you have any chronic lung disease \n- if you have liver problems \n- if you have or had hepatitis B or hepatitis C (viruses that affect the liver).

Your doctor will evaluate your risk to develop blood clots in the lungs or veins and determine if \nXELJANZ is appropriate for you.

If needed, your doctor may interrupt your XELJANZ treatment to reduce the risk of \ninfection (white blood cell counts) or anaemia (red blood cell counts). \n \nYour doctor may also perform other tests, for example to check your blood cholesterol levels or monitor \nthe health of your liver. Your doctor should test your cholesterol levels 8 weeks after you start receiving \nXELJANZ.

stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, feeling very tired - if you have any condition that increases your chance of infection (e.g., diabetes, hiv/aids, or a weak immune system) - if you have any kind of infection, are being treated for any infection, or if you have infections that keep coming back. tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. xeljanz can

diabetes, experienced a heart attack (within previous 3 months), recent major surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\\hormonal replacement therapy, if a coagulation defect is identified in you or your close relatives), if you are of older age, or if you smoke, your doctor may decide that xeljanz is not suitable for you. talk to your doctor straight away if you develop sudden shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or tenderness, or redness or discoloration in the leg or arm while taking xeljanz, as these may be signs of a clot in the lungs or veins. additional monitoring tests your doctor should perform blood tests before you start taking xeljanz, and after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment and then every 3
