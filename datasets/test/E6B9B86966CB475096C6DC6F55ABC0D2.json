NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKepivance 6.25 mg powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 6.25 mg of palifermin. \n \nPalifermin is a human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), produced by recombinant DNA technology \nin Escherichia coli.  \n \nOnce reconstituted, Kepivance contains 5 mg/ml of palifermin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nWhite lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKepivance is indicated to decrease the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis in adult \npatients with haematological malignancies receiving myeloablative radiochemotherapy associated \nwith a high incidence of severe mucositis and requiring autologous haematopoietic stem cell support.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKepivance treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer \ntherapy. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dosage of Kepivance is 60 micrograms/kg/day, administered as an intravenous \nbolus injection for three consecutive days before and three consecutive days after myeloablative \nradiochemotherapy for a total of six doses. The duration between last dose of Kepivance before \nmyeloablative radiochemotherapy and the first dose of Kepivance after myeloablative \nradiochemotherapy should be at least seven days. \n \nPre- myeloablative radiochemotherapy:  \nThe first three doses should be administered prior to myeloablative therapy, with the third \ndose 24 to 48 hours before myeloablative radiochemotherapy. \n \nPost- myeloablative radiochemotherapy:  \nThe last three doses should be administered post myeloablative radiochemotherapy; the first of these \ndoses should be administered after, but on the same day of haematopoietic stem cell infusion and at \nleast seven days after the most recent Kepivance administration (see section 4.4).  \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Kepivance in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made.  \n \nRenal impairment \nDose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nSafety and efficacy has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \nCaution should be used when dosing patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people  \nSafety and efficacy has not been evaluated in older people. Currently available data are described in \nsection 5.2 but no recommendation on dose adjustment can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous use. \nKepivance should not be administered subcutaneously due to poor local tolerability. \n \nReconstituted Kepivance should not be left at room temperature for more than one hour, and should \nbe protected from light. Prior to administration, visually inspect the solution for discolouration and \nparticulate matter before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \nEscherichia coli-derived proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nUse with chemotherapy \n \nKepivance should not be administered within 24 hours before, during infusion of, or within 24 hours \nafter administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In a clinical trial, administration of Kepivance \nwithin 24 hours of chemotherapy resulted in an increased severity and duration of oral mucositis. \n \nConcomitant heparin use \n \nIf heparin is used to maintain an intravenous line, sodium chloride solution should be used to rinse the \nline prior to and after Kepivance administration (see section 6.2). \n \nVisual acuity \n \nKGF receptors are known to be expressed on the lens of the eye. Cataractogenic effects of palifermin \ncannot be excluded (see section 5.1). Long term effects are not yet known. \n \nLong term safety \n \nThe long-term safety of Kepivance has not been fully evaluated with respect to overall survival, \nprogression free survival and secondary malignancies. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n \nNon-haematological malignancies \n \nKepivance is a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of KGF receptor expressing epithelial \ncells. The safety and efficacy of Kepivance has not been established in patients with KGF receptor \nexpressing non-haematological malignancies. Palifermin should therefore not be given to patients \nwith known or suspected non-haematological malignancies. \n \nLack of efficacy and risk of infection with high dose melphalan conditioning regimen \n \nIn a postmarketing clinical trial investigating multiple myeloma patients receiving \nmelphalan 200 mg/m2 as conditioning regimen, palifermin administration with four days between the \nlast pre dose and the first post dose did not show a therapeutic benefit in the frequency or duration of \nsevere oral mucositis compared to placebo.  \n \nIn addition, there was a higher incidence of infections in patients administered palifermin pre- and \npost-chemotherapy (49.5%) compared with patients who received placebo (24.6%). Compared with \nthe placebo group, the pre/post-chemotherapy group had a higher incidence of herpes virus infection \n(9% vs 0%), oral fungal infection (7% vs 2%) and sepsis/septic shock (12% vs 2%). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of palifermin have only been established in association with conditioning \nregimens for autologous haematopoietic stem cell support that comprise total body irradiation and \nhigh dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and etoposide) (see section 5.1). Palifermin should not \nbe used in association with myeloablative chemotherapy-only conditioning. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs a protein therapeutic, the risk for Kepivance to interact with other medicinal products is low. \n \nIn-vitro and in-vivo data suggest that palifermin binds to unfractionated as well as low molecular \nweight heparins. In two studies in healthy volunteers, co-administration of Kepivance and heparin \nresulted in approximately 5 times higher systemic exposure to palifermin, due to a lower volume of \ndistribution. The pharmacodynamic effect of palifermin, as measured by the change in Ki67 \nexpression, tended to be lower when administered with heparin but the clinical relevance of this \nfinding is unclear. However, the administration of palifermin did not affect heparin\u00b4s anticoagulant \neffect in the experimental conditions (single dose, subtherapeutic dose regimen). Due to limited data \nin patients, heparins should be used with care in patients receiving palifermin and appropriate blood \ncoagulation tests should be carried out to monitor their treatment. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Kepivance in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive and developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk to the human \nembryo or foetus is unknown. Kepivance should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether Kepivance is excreted in human milk, therefore Kepivance should not be \nadministered to women who are breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn studies in rats, no adverse effects on reproductivity/fertility parameters were observed at doses of \nup to 100 micrograms/kg/day. Systemic toxicity (clinical signs and/or changes in body weight) and \nadverse effects on male and female fertility parameters were seen at doses \u2265 300 micrograms/kg/day \n(5-fold higher than the recommended human dose).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSafety data are based on patients with haematological malignancies enrolled in randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled clinical studies, including one pharmacokinetic study, and post marketing experience. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (reported in > 1/10 patients) are reactions \nconsistent with the pharmacologic action of Kepivance on skin and oral epithelium, e.g. oedema, \nincluding peripheral oedema, and hypertrophia of oral structures. These reactions were primarily mild \nto moderate in severity and were reversible. Median time to onset was approximately 6 days following \nthe first of 3 consecutive daily doses of Kepivance, with a median duration of approximately 5 days. \nPain and arthralgia are other common adverse reactions, consistent with Kepivance treated patients \nhaving received less opioid analgesia than placebo-treated patients (see Table 2). Hypersensitivity, \nincluding Anaphylactic reactions, has also been associated with palifermin. \n \nTable 1. Adverse reactions from clinical trials and spontaneous reporting \n \nThe frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (> 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), not known (frequency cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \n   \nImmune system disorders \n \nNervous system disorders \n \n \n\nNot known: \n \nVery common: \nCommon: \n\nAnaphylactic reaction/Hypersensitivity \n \nDysgeusia \nParaesthesia oral \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n \n \n \n \n\nVery common: \n \n \nNot known: \n \n\nOral mucosal hypertrophy / Hypertrophy \nof tongue papillae,Oral mucosal \ndiscolouration / Tongue discolouration, \nTongue disorder (e.g. redness, bumps), \nTongue oedema \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \n \n\nVery common: \nCommon: \nNot known: \n\nRash, pruritus and erythema \nSkin hyperpigmentation \nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia \nsyndrome (dysaesthesia, erythema, \noedema on the palms and soles) \n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \n \n\nVery common: \n \n \nNot known \n \n \n\nArthralgia \n \n \nVaginal oedema and vulvovaginal \nerythema \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n \n\nVery common: \n \nCommon: \n\nOedema, oedema peripheral, pain and \npyrexia \nLip swelling, eyelid oedema \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n \nInvestigations \n\nNot known: \n \nVery common: \n\nFace oedema, oedema mouth  \n \nBlood amylase increased and Lipase \nIncreased1 \n \n\n1 Kepivance may cause increased lipase and amylase levels in some patients with or without \nsymptoms of abdominal pain or backache. No overt cases of pancreatitis have been reported in this \npatient population. Fractionation of increased levels of amylase revealed the increase to be \npredominantly salivary in origin. \n \nHaematopoietic recovery following PBPC infusion was similar between patients who received \nKepivance or placebo, and there were no observed differences in disease progression or survival. \n \nDose limiting toxicities were observed in 36% (5 of 14) patients receiving 6 doses \nof 80 micrograms/kg/day administered intravenously over 2 weeks (3 doses preceding and three doses \nfollowing myeloablative therapy). These events were consistent with those observed at the \nrecommended dose but were generally more severe. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with Kepivance doses greater than 80 micrograms/kg/day administered \nintravenously in patients over 2 weeks (3 doses preceding and 3 doses following myeloablative \ntherapy).  \n \nFor information on dose limiting toxicities see section 4.8. \n \nA single dose of 250 micrograms/kg has been administered intravenously to 8 healthy volunteers \nwithout severe or serious adverse effects. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic treatment, ATC code: V03A F08. \n \nPalifermin is a 140 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 16.3 kilodaltons. It differs from \nendogenous human KGF in that the first 23 N-terminal amino acids have been deleted to improve \nprotein stability. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKGF is a protein that targets epithelial cells by binding to specific cell-surface receptors thereby \nstimulating proliferation, differentiation, and upregulation of cytoprotective mechanisms (e.g., \ninduction of antioxidant enzymes). Endogenous KGF is an epithelial cell specific growth factor which \nis produced by mesenchymal cells and is naturally upregulated in response to epithelial tissue injury. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atcddd/indexdatabase/index.php?query=V03AF\n\n\n7 \n\nEpithelial cell proliferation was assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemical staining in healthy subjects. \nA 3-fold or greater increase in Ki67 staining was observed in buccal biopsies from 3 of 6 healthy \nsubjects given palifermin at 40 micrograms/kg/day intravenously for 3 days, when measured 24 hours \nafter the third dose. Dose-dependent epithelial cell proliferation was observed 48 hours post-dosing in \nhealthy subjects given single intravenous doses of 120 to 250 micrograms/kg. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe palifermin clinical program in the setting of myelotoxic therapy requiring haematopoietic stem \ncell (HSC) support included 650 patients with haematologic malignancies enrolled in 3 randomised, \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies and a pharmacokinetic study. \n \nEfficacy and safety of palifermin were established in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudy in which patients received high-dose cytotoxic therapy consisting of fractionated total-body \nirradiation (12 Gy total dose; Day -8 to -5), high-dose etoposide (60 mg/kg; Day -4), and high-dose \ncyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg; Day -2) followed by PBPC support for the treatment of \nhaematological malignancies ((Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin\u2019s disease, Acute Myeloid \nLeukaemia (AML), Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma). In this study, 212 patients were \nrandomised and received either palifermin or placebo. Palifermin was administered as a daily \nintravenous injection of 60 micrograms/kg for 3 consecutive days prior to initiation of cytotoxic \ntherapy and for 3 consecutive days following infusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells with nine \ndays between the last pre dose and first post dose. \n \nThe main efficacy endpoint of the study was the number of days during which patients experienced \nsevere oral mucositis (grade 3/4 on the World Health Organisation (WHO) scale). Other endpoints \nincluded the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis and the requirement for opioid \nanalgesia. There was no evidence of a delay in time to haematopoietic recovery in patients who \nreceived palifermin as compared to patients who received placebo. The efficacy results are presented \nin Table 2. \n \nTable 2.

These patient-reported outcomes were highly correlated to the clinician grading of \noral mucositis using the WHO scale. \n \nA randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted post-approval to evaluate the \nefficacy of palifermin given pre- or pre- and post- chemotherapy (CT). The study included three \ntreatment arms and was designed to compare each of the palifermin arms (pre- and pre/post-) to \nplacebo. \nIn this study (n = 281), patients with multiple myeloma received conditioning with melphalan \n(200 mg/m2) prior to autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  \n \nThe incidence of ulcerative oral mucositis was 57.9% in the placebo arm, 68.7% in the pre/post CT \ngroup and 51.4% in the pre-CT group. Neither of the two dosing regimens demonstrated statistically \nsignificant results versus placebo. The incidence of severe (grades 3 and 4) oral mucositis in \nthe 3 groups was 36.8%, 38.3% and 23.9% for the placebo, pre/post CT and pre-CT groups \nrespectively, with no statistical significance being demonstrated.  \n \nCataractogenic effects of palifermin cannot be excluded following results of ophthalmologic \nexaminations in a subset of patients (n = 66; 14 in the placebo group, 52 in the palifermin group) who \nwere followed for 12 months after the acute phase of the above post-approval study. For the primary \nendpoint, which was incidence of cataract development or progression at 12 months (defined as an \nincrease of \u2265 0.3 in the LOCS III score), a greater proportion of subjects experienced cataract \ndevelopment in the palifermin group compared with the placebo group (28.6 % in the placebo group \nvs 48.1% in the palifermin group). This difference was not statistically significant. Visual acuity was \nnot affected at 6 or 12 months in either treatment group. There was an imbalance in age distribution \nwith more elderly (> 65 years) patients in the palifermin group. \n \nPaediatric population \nA phase I dose escalation study was conducted in paediatric patients aged 1-16 years. A total of 27 \npaediatric patients with leukaemia were randomized to 40, 60 or 80 micrograms/kg/day of palifermin \nfor 3 days pre- and post- hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The conditioning regimen \nconsisted of total body irradiation (TBI), etoposide and cyclophosphamide. There was a lower \nincidence of severe oral mucositis in patients receiving 80 micrograms/kg/day but no effect on the \nincidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although palifermin was safe at all doses tested \nthe incidence of skin reactions increased with the dose. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of palifermin were studied in healthy volunteers and patients with \nhaematological malignancies. After single intravenous doses of 20 to 250 micrograms/kg (healthy \nvolunteers) and 60 micrograms/kg (cancer patients), palifermin exhibited rapid extravascular \ndistribution In patients with haematological malignancies mean Vss was 5 l/kg and mean clearance \nabout 1300 ml/hour/kg with an average terminal half-life of approximately 4.5 hours. Approximately \ndose-linear pharmacokinetics were observed in healthy volunteers after single dose administration up \nto 250 micrograms/kg. No accumulation of palifermin occurred after 3 consecutive daily doses \nof 20 and 40 micrograms/kg (healthy volunteers) or 60 micrograms/kg (adult patients) or 40 to 80 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nmicrograms/kg (paediatric patients). Inter-subject variability is high with a CV% of about 50% for CL \nand 60% for Vss. \n \nNo gender-related differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of palifermin. Mild to moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-80 ml/min) did not influence palifermin pharmacokinetics. \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), clearance was decreased \nby 22% (n = 5). In patients with end-stage renal disease (requiring dialysis) palifermin clearance was \ndecreased by 10% (n = 6). The pharmacokinetic profile in patients with hepatic insufficiency has not \nbeen assessed. \n \nOlder people \nIn a single dose study the clearance of palifermin was approximately 30% lower in 8 healthy subjects \naged 66-73 years after a dose of 90 micrograms/kg than in younger subjects (\u2264 65 years) after a dose \nof 180 micrograms/kg. Based on these limited data no recommendation on dose adjustment can be \nmade. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a small multiple-dose study in paediatric patients (1 to 16 years old) receiving 40, 60 or \n80 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days pre- and post- HSCT, there was no effect of age on the \npharmacokinetics of palifermin although a large variability was observed in the estimated parameters. \nSystemic exposure did not appear to increase with the dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSalient findings in toxicology studies in rat and monkey were generally attributable to the \npharmacological activity of palifermin, specifically, proliferation of epithelial tissues. \n \nIn fertility/general reproductive toxicity studies in rats, palifermin treatment was associated with \nsystemic toxicity (clinical signs and/or changes in body weight) and adverse effects on male and \nfemale reproductive/fertility parameters at doses greater than or equal to 300 micrograms/kg/day. \nNo adverse effects on reproductive/fertility parameters were observed at doses of up to \n100 micrograms/kg/day. These no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) doses were associated with \nsystemic exposures up to 2.5 times greater than anticipated clinical exposure.  \n \nIn embryo/foetal development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, palifermin treatment was associated \nwith developmental toxicity (increased post-implantation loss, reduced litter size, and/or reduced \nfoetal weight) at doses of 500 and 150 micrograms/kg/day, respectively. Treatment with these doses \nwas also associated with maternal effects (clinical signs and/or changes in body weight/food \nconsumption), suggesting that palifermin was not selectively toxic to development in either species. \nNo adverse developmental effects were observed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 300 and \n60 micrograms/kg/day, respectively. These NOAEL doses were associated with systemic exposures \n(based on AUC) up to 9.7 and 2.1 times, respectively, anticipated clinical exposure. Peri- and \npostnatal development has not been studied. \n \nPalifermin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates epithelial cells through the KGF receptor. \nHaematologic malignancies do not express the KGF receptor. However, patients treated with \nchemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are at higher risk of developing secondary tumours some of which \nmay express KGF receptors, and theoretically, be stimulated by KGF receptor ligands. In a study to \nassess potential carcinogenicity in transgenic rasH2 mice, no treatment related increases in the \nincidence of neoplastic lesions were observed. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n6.

What Kepivance is and what it is used for \n \nKepivance contains the active substance palifermin which is a protein produced by biotechnology in a \nbacteria called Escherichia coli. Palifermin stimulates the growth of specific cells called epithelial \ncells that form the tissue lining of your mouth and digestive tract, as well as other tissues such as skin. \nPalifermin works in the same way as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) which is made naturally by \nyour body in small amounts. \n \nKepivance is used to treat oral mucositis (soreness, dryness and inflammation of the mouth) which \nhas occurred as a side effect of treatments for your blood cancer. \n \nTo treat your blood cancer you may be receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy and autologous \nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (cells from your own body that produce blood cells). One of \nthe side effects of these treatments is oral mucositis. Kepivance is used to reduce the frequency, \nduration and severity of oral mucositis symptoms. \n \nKepivance should only be used in adults over the age of 18 years. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Kepivance \n \nDo not use Kepivance: \n- if you are allergic to palifermin, Escherichia coli derived proteins or any other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nChildren \nKepivance is not recommended in children (0 to 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Kepivance \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Kepivance might interact with a medicine called heparin. Please inform your doctor if you \nare receiving or have recently received heparin. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nKepivance has not been tested in pregnant women.

Do not use Kepivance if you are breast-\nfeeding. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to use Kepivance \n \n Kepivance will be given to you by a doctor or nurse with experience in cancer treatment. \n \nThe usual dose of Kepivance is 60 micrograms of Kepivance per kilogram of bodyweight per day. \nThis dose will be given to you as an intravenous injection (into a vein). \n \nWhen you will be given Kepivance \nYou will be given Kepivance for three days in a row before chemotherapy and radiotherapy and for \nthree days in a row after chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a total of six doses.  \n \nThe last of the three doses given before chemotherapy andradiotherapy, must be given at \nleast 24 to 48 hours before the chemotherapy and radiotherapy starts. The first of the three doses \ngiven after the chemotherapy and radiotherapy must be given at least 7 days after the most recent \nKepivance administration. \n \nFor information on preparation and administration of Kepivance, please see information for \nhealthcare professionals at the end of this leaflet. \n \n \n4.
