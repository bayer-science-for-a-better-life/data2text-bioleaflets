NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMyfenax 250 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 250 mg mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule) \n \nThe capsule body is caramel opaque, printed with ‘250’ axially in black ink. \nThe capsule cap is light blue opaque printed ‘M’ axially in black ink. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMyfenax is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute \ntransplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Myfenax should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant \nspecialists. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in renal transplant \n \nAdults \nOral Myfenax should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in \nrenal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population aged 2 to 18 years \nThe recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to \na maximum of 2 g daily). Myfenax capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface \narea of at least 1.25 m2. Patients with a body surface area of 1.25 to 1.5 m2 may be prescribed \nMyfenax capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose). Patients with a body surface area \ngreater than 1.5 m2 may be prescribed Myfenax capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). \nAs some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared \nwith adults, temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into \naccount relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction. \n \nPaediatric population < 2 years \nThere are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient \nto make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nUse in cardiac transplant \n \nAdults \nOral Myfenax should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in \ncardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. \n \nUse in hepatic transplant \n \nAdults \nIntravenous mycophenolate mofetil should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic \ntransplant, with oral Myfenax initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral \ndose in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. \n \nUse in special populations \n \nElderly \nThe recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a \nday for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n< 25 mL/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g \nadministered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose \nadjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see \nsection 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal \nimpairment. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \nNo data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \n \nTreatment during rejection episodes \nMycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant \nrejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of \nMyfenax is not required. There is no basis for Myfenax dose adjustment following cardiac transplant \nrejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nBecause mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, Myfenax \ncapsules should not be opened or crushed to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous \nmembranes of the powder contained in Myfenax capsules. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly \nwith soap and water; rinse eyes with plain water. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nMyfenax should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nMyfenax have been observed (see section 4.8). \n \nMyfenax should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly effective \ncontraception (see section 4.6). \n \nMyfenax treatment should not be initiated in women of child bearing potential without providing a \npregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nMyfenax should not be used during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). \n \nMyfenax should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeoplasms \n \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding Myfenax, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of \nimmunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk \nfor skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective \nclothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including Myfenax, are at increased risk for opportunistic \ninfections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such \ninfections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections \ncaused by polyomaviruses (BK virus associated nephropathy, JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis \nC have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. \n \nThere have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in \npatients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of \nthese cases switching mycophenolate mofetil to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum \nIgG levels returning to normal. Patients on mycophenolate mofetil who develop recurrent infections \nshould have their serum immunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant \nhypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the \npotent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. \n \nThere have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received \nmycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases \nswitching mycophenolate mofetil to another immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in \nrespiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a \ndirect effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and \npulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients who \ndevelop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are investigated. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nBlood and immune system \n \nPatients receiving Myfenax should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to Myfenax \nitself, concomitant medicinal products, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients \ntaking Myfenax should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for \nthe second and third months of treatment then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops \n(absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/ µl) it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue Myfenax. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate \nmofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil \ninduced PRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of Myfenax therapy. \nChanges to Myfenax therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant \nrecipients in order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients receiving Myfenax should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, \nunexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. \n \nPatients should be advised that during treatment with Myfenax, vaccinations may be less effective and \nthe use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be \nof value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. \n \nGastro-intestinal \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse \nevents, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. \nMyfenax should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease. \n \nMyfenax is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be \navoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-\ntransferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. \n \nInteractions \n \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing \nimmunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others \ndevoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in \nchanges of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. \ncholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma \nlevels and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of \nMPA may be appropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or \nvice versa) or to ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. \nrisk of rejection, treatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). \n \nIt is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil should not be administered concomitantly with \nazathioprine because such concomitant administration has not been studied. \n \nThe risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been \nestablished (see also section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including \ncytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary \noedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTeratogenic effects \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and \ncongenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF \nexposure during pregnancy. Therefore, Myfenax is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no \nsuitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. \ncontraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with mycophenolate. \nPhysicians should ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, \nthe need for effective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a \npossibility of pregnancy. \n \nContraception (see section 4.6) \n \nBecause of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations \nwhen mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment \nshould be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myfenax therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks \nafter stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two \ncomplementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for \ncontraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nEducational materials \n \nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional \nimportant safety information, the Marketing Authorisation holder will provide educational materials to \nhealthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity \nof mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need \nfor pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention \nmeasures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to \nmale patients. \n \nAdditional precautions \n \nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of \nmycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation \nof mycophenolate. \n \nExcipient \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAciclovir \nHigher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered \nwith aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not \nconsidered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence \nof renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and \naciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in \nconcentrations of both substances may occur. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAntacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \nDecreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium \nhydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with \nmycophenolate mofetil. When comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between \nmycophenolate mofetil patients taking PPIs vs. mycophenolate mofetil patients not taking PPIs, no \nsignificant differences were seen. This data support extrapolation of this finding to all antacids \nbecause the reduction in exposure when mycophenolate mofetil was co- administered with magnesium \nand aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when mycophenolate mofetil was co-administered \nwith PPIs. \n \nMedicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, \nantibiotics) \nCaution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because \nof their potential to reduce the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nCholestyramine \nFollowing single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects \npre-treated with 4 g three times a day (TID) of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction \nin the AUC of MPA (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant \nadministration because of the potential to reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nCiclosporin A \nCiclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. In contrast, if \nconcomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should be expected. \nCsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30-50% in \nrenal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil and CsA compared with patients \nreceiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4). \nConversely, changes of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one \nof the immunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA´s enterohepatic cycle. \n \nAntibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, \ncephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA \nenterohepatic recirculation thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning \nthe following antibiotics is available: \n \nCiprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid \nReductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal \ntransplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or \namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to \ncease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in predose level may not accurately \nrepresent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of Myfenax should not \nnormally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. \n \nNorfloxacin and metronidazole \nIn healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when mycophenolate mofetil was \nconcomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and \nmetronidazole combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of \nmycophenolate mofetil. \n \nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nNo effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. \n \nMedicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) \nConcomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. \nCaution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with mycophenolate \nmofetil. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nIsavuconazole \nAn increase of MPA AUC0-∞ by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of isavuconazole. \n \nTelmisartan \nConcomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately \n30% decrease of MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR \ngamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an \nenhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of \ngraft loss or adverse event profiles between mycophenolate mofetil patients with and without \nconcomitant telmisartan medication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug \ninteraction were seen. \n \nGanciclovir \nBased on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral \nmycophenolate mofetil and intravenous ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-\nadministration of these agents (which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in \nincreases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics \nis anticipated and mycophenolate mofetil dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal \nimpairment in whom Myfenax and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered \nthe dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and patients monitored carefully. \n \nOral contraceptives \nThe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-\nadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 5.2). \n \nRifampicin \nIn patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and \nrifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to \nmonitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Myfenax doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy \nwhen rifampicin is administered concomitantly. \n \nSevelamer \nDecrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when \nmycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical \nconsequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is recommended, however, to administer Myfenax at least one \nhour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. \nThere are no data on mycophenolate mofetil with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. \n \nTacrolimus \nIn hepatic transplant patients initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax \nof MPA, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, were not significantly affected by co-\nadministration with tacrolimus. In contrast, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus \nAUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g taken twice a day [BID], morning and \nevening) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal \ntransplant patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by mycophenolate mofetil \n(see also section 4.4). \n \nLive vaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody \nresponse to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPotential interaction \nCo-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of \nMPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with \nMPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular \nsecretion. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential \nmust use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myfenax therapy, \nduring therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of \ncontraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. \n \nPregnancy \n \nMyfenax is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy \ntest result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy. \n \nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss \nand congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding \npregnancy prevention and planning. \n \nBefore starting Myfenax treatment, women of childbearing potential must have two negative serum or \nurine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL in order to exclude unintended exposure \nof the embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed \n8-10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two \ntests 8-10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a \npregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test performed \n8-10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in \ncontraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients \nshould be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and \ncongenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; \n• Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to \n\nmycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ \ntransplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n• Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed \nto mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the overall \npopulation and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated with \nimmunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). \n\n \nCongenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-\nmarketing in children of patients exposed to mycophenolate in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants during pregnancy. The following malformations were most frequently reported: \n• Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal \n\natresia (middle ear); \n• Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; \n• Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); \n• Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; \n• Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); \n• Tracheo-Oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia); \n• Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida; \n\n\n\n10 \n\n• Renal abnormalities. \n \nIn addition there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: \n• Microphthalmia; \n• Congenital choroid plexus cyst; \n• Septum pellucidum agenesis; \n• Olfactory nerve agenesis. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known \nwhether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, Myfenax is contraindicated in breast-feeding \nmothers (see section 4.3). \n \nMen \n \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nMPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on \nanimal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is \nso low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures by small margins, such \nthat the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \n \nTherefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or \ntheir female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male \npatient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive \npotential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified health-care professional the potential \nrisks of fathering a child. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nMycophenolate mofetil may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and \ntherefore patients are advised to use caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nAn estimated total of 1557 patients received mycophenolate mofetil during five clinical trials in the \nprevention of acute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were \nincluded in one hepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Azathioprine was the \ncomparator used in the hepatic and cardiac studies and in two of the renal studies whilst the other renal \nstudy was placebo-controlled. Patients in all study arms also received ciclosporine and corticosteroids. \nThe types of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing with mycophenolate mofetil are similar \nto those seen in the controlled renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant studies. \n \nDiarrhoea, leucopenia, sepsis and vomiting were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug \nreactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with ciclosporin \nand corticosteroids. There is also evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from clinical trials and post marketing experience are listed in \nTable 1, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding \nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nand very rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain ADRs \nacross the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and \ncardiac transplant patients. \n \nTable 1 Summary of adverse drug reactions occurring in patients treated with mycophenolate \nmofetil reported from clinical trials and post marketing experience \n \nAdverse drug

991 (2 g/3 g mycophenolate mofetil daily), 289 (3 g mycophenolate mofetil daily) and 277 (2 g \nIV/3 g oral mycophenolate mofetil daily) patients were treated in Phase III studies for the prevention \nof rejection in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplantation, respectively. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other \nmalignancies, particularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac \ntransplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the \n1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years. \n \nInfections \nAll patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal \ninfections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic \nagents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section \n4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and \natypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nmycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in \nrenal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, \ncytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with \nCMV viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of \nJC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients \ntreated with immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders \nCytopenias, including leucopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and \nhemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular \nmonitoring of patients taking mycophenolate mofetil is advised (see section 4.4). There have been \nreports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, \nsome of which have been fatal. \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate \nmofetil (see section 4.4). \nIsolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have \nbeen observed in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. These changes are not associated with \nimpaired neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in \nhaematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in \nimmunosuppressed patients such as those that receive mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers \noften complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis \nand colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of \npatients with mycophenolate mofetil-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous \natrophy (see section 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity  \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction, have been \nreported. \n \nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \nCases of spontaneous abortions have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nCongenital disorders \nCongenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to \nmycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nThere have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated \nwith mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been \nfatal. There have also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. \n \nImmune system disorders \nHypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nEdema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal \ntrials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly \nreported. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients \naged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were \ngenerally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice daily. \nHowever, the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric \npopulation, particularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, \nleucopenia, anaemia and infection. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to \nimmunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving Myfenax as part of a combination immunosuppressive \nregimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive \ndisease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger \nindividuals. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during \npost-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose \ncases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nIt is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of \nthe immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section \n4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHaemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. \nBile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic \nrecirculation of the drug (see section 5.2). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code: LO4A A06 \n \nMechanism of action \nMycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is a potent, \nselective, uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and \ntherefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into \nDNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo \nsynthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, MPA has more potent \ncytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and \ncomplete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of \nacute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of mycophenolate \nmofetil is correlated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate \nmofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 94% relative to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no \neffect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses \nof 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence \nof food. Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral \nadministration.  \n \nDistribution \n \nAs a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are \nusually observed at approximately 6-12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of \napproximately 40% is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating \nthat there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation. \nMPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via \nenterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is \npharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF´s side effects \n(diarrhoea, leucopenia). \n \nElimination \n \nA negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of dose) in the urine. Oral administration \nof radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose; with \n93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the faeces. Most (about \n87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. \n \nAt clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. \nHowever, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are \nremoved. By interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as \ncholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). \n\n\n\n17 \n\nMPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) \nand multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP \nisoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the \nglucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, \nbut its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney MPA and its \nmetabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. \n \nIn the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant \npatients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower \ncompared to the late post-transplant period (3 - 6 months post-transplant). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe \nchronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) were 28-75% higher \nrelative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal \nimpairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3-6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the \nknown renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe \nchronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant \npatients with severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nDelayed renal graft function \nIn patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12 h was comparable to \nthat seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12 h \nwas 2-3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a \ntransient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal \ngraft function. Dose adjustment of Myfenax does not appear to be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively \nunaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend \non the particular disease. However, hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect. \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to \n18 years) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC \nvalues similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil at a \ndose of 1 g BID in the early and late post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were \nsimilar in the early and late post-transplant period. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered \nin the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. \n \nPatients taking oral contraceptives \nA study of the co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g BID) and combined oral \ncontraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to \n0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant \nwomen (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no \nclinically relevant influence of mycophenolate mofetil on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral \ncontraceptives. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and \nprogesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were \nunaffected by co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the \nanimal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or \nCmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3-2 times \nthe systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day. \n \nTwo genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow \nmicronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. \nThese effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide \nsynthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nMycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose represents 2-3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical \ndose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3-2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study \nconducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, \nagnathia and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or \nreproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation. \n \nIn teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at \n6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day \n(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and \ndiaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at \nthese levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the \nclinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nThe haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies \nconducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at \nsystemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended \ndose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at \nsystemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended doses. \nGastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the \nhighest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical \ntoxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in \nhuman clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMyfenax 500 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n \nPale purple, oval shaped film-coated tablet, debossed with \"M500\" on one side and plain on the other \nside. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMyfenax is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute \ntransplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Myfenax should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant \nspecialists. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in renal transplant \n \nAdults \nOral Myfenax should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in \nrenal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population aged 2 to 18 years \nThe recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to \na maximum of 2 g daily). Myfenax tablets should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface \narea greater than 1.5 m2, at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As some adverse reactions occur \nwith greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary dose \nreduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors \nincluding severity of reaction. \n \nPaediatric population < 2 years \nThere are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient \nto make dose recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. \n \nUse in cardiac transplant \n \nAdults \nOral Myfenax should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in \ncardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. \n \nUse in hepatic transplant \n \nAdults \nIntravenous mycophenolate mofetil should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic \ntransplant, with oral Myfenax initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral \ndose in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. \n \nUse in special populations \n \nElderly \nThe recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a \nday for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n< 25 mL/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g \nadministered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose \nadjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see \nsection 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal \nimpairment. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \nNo data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \n \nTreatment during rejection episodes \nMycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant \nrejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dose reduction or interruption of \nMyfenax is not required. There is no basis for Myfenax dose adjustment following cardiac transplant \nrejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nBecause mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, Myfenax \ntablets should not be crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nMyfenax should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nMyfenax have been observed (see section 4.8). \n \nMyfenax should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly effective \ncontraception (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nMyfenax treatment should not be initiated in women of child bearing potential without providing a \npregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nMyfenax should not be used during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). \n \nMyfenax should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeoplasms \n \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding Myfenax, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of \nimmunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk \nfor skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective \nclothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including Myfenax, are at increased risk for opportunistic \ninfections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such \ninfections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections \ncaused by polyomaviruses (BK virus associated nephropathy, JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis \nC have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. \n \nThere have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in \npatients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of \nthese cases switching mycophenolate mofetil to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum \nIgG levels returning to normal. Patients on mycophenolate mofetil who develop recurrent infections \nshould have their serum immunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant \nhypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the \npotent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. \n \nThere have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received \nmycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases \nswitching mycophenolate mofetil to another immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in \nrespiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a \ndirect effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and \npulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients who \ndevelop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are investigated. \n \nBlood and immune system \n \nPatients receiving Myfenax should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to Myfenax \nitself, concomitant medicinal products, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients \ntaking Myfenax should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for \nthe second and third months of treatment then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops \n(absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/ µl) it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue Myfenax. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate \nmofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil \n\n\n\n24 \n\ninduced PRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of Myfenax therapy. \nChanges to Myfenax therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant \nrecipients in order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients receiving Myfenax should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, \nunexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. \n \nPatients should be advised that during treatment with Myfenax, vaccinations may be less effective and \nthe use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be \nof value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. \n \nGastro-intestinal \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse \nevents, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. \nMyfenax should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease. \n \nMyfenax is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be \navoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-\ntransferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. \n \nInteractions \n \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing \nimmunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others \ndevoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in \nchanges of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. \ncholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma \nlevel and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of \nMPA may be appropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or \nvice versa) or to ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. \nrisk of rejection, treatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). \n \nIt is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil should not be administered concomitantly with \nazathioprine because such concomitant administration has not been studied. \n \nThe risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been \nestablished (see also section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including \ncytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary \noedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). \n \nTeratogenic effects \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and \ncongenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF \nexposure during pregnancy. Therefore, Myfenax is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no \nsuitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. \ncontraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with mycophenolate. \nPhysicians should ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, \nthe need for effective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a \npossibility of pregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nContraception (see section 4.6) \n \nBecause of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations \nwhen mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment \nshould be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myfenax therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks \nafter stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two \ncomplementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for \ncontraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nEducational materials \n \nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional \nimportant safety information, the Marketing Authorisation holder will provide educational materials to \nhealthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity \nof mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need \nfor pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention \nmeasures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to \nmale patients. \n \nAdditional precautions \n \nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of \nmycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation \nof mycophenolate. \n \nExcipient \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAciclovir \nHigher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered \nwith aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not \nconsidered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence \nof renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and \naciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in \nconcentrations of both substances may occur. \n \nAntacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \nDecreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium \nhydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with \nmycophenolate mofetil. When comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between \nmycophenolate mofetil patients taking PPIs vs. mycophenolate mofetil patients not taking PPIs, no \nsignificant differences were seen. This data support extrapolation of this finding to all antacids \nbecause the reduction in exposure when mycophenolate mofetil was co- administered with magnesium \nand aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when mycophenolate mofetil was co-administered \nwith PPIs. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nMedicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, \nantibiotics) \nCaution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because \nof their potential to reduce the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nCholestyramine \nFollowing single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects \npre-treated with 4 g three times a day (TID) of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction \nin the AUC of MPA (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant \nadministration because of the potential to reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nCiclosporin A \nCiclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. In contrast, if \nconcomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should be expected. \nCsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30 50% in \nrenal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil and CsA compared with patients \nreceiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4). \nConversely, changes of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one \nof the immunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA´s enterohepatic cycle. \n \nAntibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, \ncephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA \nenterohepatic recirculation thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning \nthe following antibiotics is available: \n \nCiprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid \nReductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal \ntransplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or \namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to \ncease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in predose level may not accurately \nrepresent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of Myfenax should not \nnormally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. \n \nNorfloxacin and metronidazole \nIn healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when mycophenolate mofetil was \nconcomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and \nmetronidazole combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of \nmycophenolate mofetil. \n \nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nNo effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. \n \nMedicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) \nConcomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. \nCaution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with mycophenolate \nmofetil. \n \nIsavuconazole \nAn increase of MPA AUC0-∞ by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of isavuconazole. \n \nTelmisartan \nConcomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately \n30% decrease of MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR \ngamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an \nenhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of \ngraft loss or adverse event profiles between mycophenolate mofetil patients with and without \n\n\n\n27 \n\nconcomitant telmisartan medication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug \ninteraction were seen. \n \nGanciclovir \nBased on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral \nmycophenolate mofetil and intravenous ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-\nadministration of these agents (which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in \nincreases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics \nis anticipated and Myfenax dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom \nmycophenolate mofetil and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered the \ndose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and patients monitored carefully. \n \nOral contraceptives \nThe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-\nadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 5.2). \n \nRifampicin \nIn patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and \nrifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to \nmonitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Myfenax doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy \nwhen rifampicin is administered concomitantly. \n \nSevelamer \nDecrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when \nmycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical \nconsequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is recommended, however, to administer Myfenax at least one \nhour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. \nThere are no data on mycophenolate mofetil with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. \n \nTacrolimus \nIn hepatic transplant patients initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax \nof MPA, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, were not significantly affected by co-\nadministration with tacrolimus. In contrast, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus \nAUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g taken twice a day [BID], morning and \nevening) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal \ntransplant patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by mycophenolate mofetil \n(see also section 4.4). \n \nLive vaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody \nresponse to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPotential interaction \nCo-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of \nMPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with \nMPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular \nsecretion. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential \nmust use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myfenax therapy, \nduring therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of \ncontraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. \n \nPregnancy \n \nMyfenax is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy \ntest result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy. \n \nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss \nand congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding \npregnancy prevention and planning. \n \nBefore starting Myfenax treatment, women of childbearing potential must have two negative serum or \nurine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL in order to exclude unintended exposure \nof the embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 8-10 \ndays after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two tests \n8-10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a \npregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test performed \n8-10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in \ncontraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients \nshould be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and \ncongenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; \n• Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to \n\nmycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ \ntransplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n• Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed \nto mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the overall \npopulation and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated with \nimmunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). \n\n \nCongenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-\nmarketing in children of patients exposed to mycophenolate in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants during pregnancy. The following malformations were most frequently reported: \n• Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal \n\natresia (middle ear); \n• Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; \n• Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); \n• Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; \n• Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); \n• Tracheo-Oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia); \n• Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida; \n• Renal abnormalities. \n \nIn addition there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: \n• Microphthalmia; \n• Congenital choroid plexus cyst; \n• Septum pellucidum agenesis; \n\n\n\n29 \n\n• Olfactory nerve agenesis. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known \nwhether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, Myfenax is contraindicated in breast-feeding \nmothers (see section 4.3). \n \nMen \n \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nMPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on \nanimal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is \nso low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures by small margins, such \nthat the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \n \nTherefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or \ntheir female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male \npatient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive \npotential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified health-care professional the potential \nrisks of fathering a child. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nMycophenolate mofetil may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and \ntherefore patients are advised to use caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nAn estimated total of 1557 patients received mycophenolate mofetil during five clinical trials in the \nprevention of acute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were \nincluded in one hepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Azathioprine was the \ncomparator used in the hepatic and cardiac studies and in two of the renal studies whilst the other renal \nstudy was placebo-controlled. Patients in all study arms also received ciclosporine and corticosteroids. \nThe types of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing with mycophenolate mofetil are similar \nto those seen in the controlled renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant studies. \n \nDiarrhoea, leucopenia, sepsis and vomiting were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug \nreactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with ciclosporin \nand corticosteroids. There is also evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from clinical trials and post marketing experience are listed in \nTable 1, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding \nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nand very rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain ADRs \n\n\n\n30 \n\nacross the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and \ncardiac transplant patients. \n \nTable 1 Summary of adverse drug reactions occurring in patients treated with mycophenolate \nmofetil reported from clinical trials and post marketing experience \n

mycophenolate mofetil daily), 289 (3 g mycophenolate mofetil daily) and 277 (2 g \nIV/3 g oral mycophenolate mofetil daily) patients were treated in Phase III studies for the prevention \nof rejection in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplantation, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other \nmalignancies, particularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac \ntransplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the \n1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years. \n \nInfections \nAll patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal \ninfections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic \nagents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section \n4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and \natypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nmycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in \nrenal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, \ncytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with \nCMV viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of \nJC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients \ntreated with immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders \nCytopenias, including leucopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and \nhemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular \nmonitoring of patients taking mycophenolate mofetil is advised (see section 4.4). There have been \nreports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, \nsome of which have been fatal. \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate \nmofetil (see section 4.4). \nIsolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have \nbeen observed in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. These changes are not associated with \nimpaired neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in \nhaematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in \nimmunosuppressed patients such as those that receive mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers \noften complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis \nand colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of \npatients with mycophenolate mofetil-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous \natrophy (see section 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity  \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction, have been \nreported. \n \nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \nCases of spontaneous abortions have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. \n \nCongenital disorders \nCongenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to \nmycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nThere have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated \nwith mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been \nfatal. There have also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. \n \nImmune system disorders \nHypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nEdema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal \ntrials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly \nreported. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients \naged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were \ngenerally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice daily. \nHowever, the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric \npopulation, particularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, \nleucopenia, anaemia and infection. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to \nimmunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving Myfenax as part of a combination immunosuppressive \nregimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive \ndisease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger \nindividuals. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during \npost-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose \ncases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nIt is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of \nthe immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section \n4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHaemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. \nBile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic \nrecirculation of the drug (see section 5.2). \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n35 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code: LO4A A06 \n \nMechanism of action \nMycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is a potent, \nselective, uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and \ntherefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into \nDNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo \nsynthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, MPA has more potent \ncytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and \ncomplete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of \nacute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of mycophenolate \nmofetil is correlated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate \nmofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 94% relative to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no \neffect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses \nof 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence \nof food. Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral \nadministration.  \n \nDistribution \n \nAs a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are \nusually observed at approximately 6-12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of \napproximately 40% is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating \nthat there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation. \nMPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via \nenterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is \npharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF´s side effects \n(diarrhoea, leucopenia). \n \nElimination \n \nA negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of dose) in the urine. Oral administration \nof radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose; with \n93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the faeces. Most (about \n87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. \n \nAt clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. \nHowever, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are \nremoved. By interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as \ncholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). \nMPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) \nand multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP \n\n\n\n36 \n\nisoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the \nglucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, \nbut its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney MPA and its \nmetabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. \n \nIn the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant \npatients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower \ncompared to the late post-transplant period (3 – 6 months post-transplant). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe \nchronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) were 28-75% higher \nrelative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal \nimpairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3-6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the \nknown renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe \nchronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant \npatients with severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nDelayed renal graft function \nIn patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12 h was comparable to \nthat seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12 h \nwas 2-3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a \ntransient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal \ngraft function. Dose adjustment of Myfenax does not appear to be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively \nunaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend \non the particular disease. However, hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect. \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to \n18 years) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC \nvalues similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil at a \ndose of 1 g BID in the early and late post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were \nsimilar in the early and late post-transplant period. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered \nin the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. \n \nPatients taking oral contraceptives \nA study of the co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g BID) and combined oral \ncontraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to \n0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant \nwomen (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no \nclinically relevant influence of mycophenolate mofetil on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral \ncontraceptives. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and \nprogesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were \nunaffected by co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the \nanimal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or \nCmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3-2 times \nthe systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day. \n \nTwo genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow \nmicronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. \nThese effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide \nsynthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nMycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose represents 2-3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical \ndose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3-2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study \nconducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, \nagnathia and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or \nreproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation. \n \nIn teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at \n6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day \n(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and \ndiaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at \nthese levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the \nclinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nThe haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies \nconducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at \nsystemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended \ndose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at \nsystemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended doses. \nGastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the \nhighest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical \ntoxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in \nhuman clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nMyfenax 250 mg hard capsules \nmycophenolate mofetil \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Myfenax is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Myfenax \n3. How to take Myfenax \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Myfenax \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Myfenax is and what it is used for \n \nMyfenax is a medicine that is used to suppress immune activity. \n \nThe active substance in this medicine is called mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nMyfenax is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted kidney, heart or liver. It is used in \ncombination with other medicines with a similar function (i.e. ciclosporin and corticosteroids). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Myfenax \n \nWARNING \nMycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, \nyou must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the \ncontraception advice given to you by your doctor. \nYour doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of \nmycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. \nIf you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before \nyou take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and \nprecautions” and “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding”. \n \nDo not take Myfenax, \n• if you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test \n\nbefore your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. \n• if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant. \n• if you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). \n• if you are breast-feeding. \nDo not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Myfenax. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with Myfenax: \n• if you experience any evidence of infection (e.g. fever, sore throat), unexpected bruising and/or \n\nbleeding. \n• if you have or ever have had any problems with your digestive system, e.g. stomach ulcers. \n• if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking \n\nMyfenax. \n \nMyfenax reduces your body’s defence mechanism. Because of this, there is an increased risk of skin \ncancer. Therefore you should limit your exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light by wearing \nappropriate protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nYou must not donate blood during treatment with Myfenax and for at least 6 weeks after stopping \ntreatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with Myfenax and for at least 90 days after \nstopping treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nMyfenax is used in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) to prevent a body rejecting a transplanted \nkidney. \nMyfenax should not be used in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) for heart or liver \ntransplantation. \nMyfenax should not be used at all in children under 2 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Myfenax \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIf you answer yes to any of the following questions talk to your doctor before you start to take \nMyfenax: \n• Are you taking any medicines containing: \n\no azathioprine or other immunosuppressive agents (which are sometimes given to patients after a \ntransplant operation), \n\no cholestyramine (used to treat patients with high blood cholesterol), \no rifampicin (antibiotic), \no antacids or proton pump inhibitors (used for acid problem in your stomach such as indigestion), \no phosphate binders (used in patients with chronic kidney failure to reduce the absorption of \n\nphosphate), \no antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections), \no isavuconazole (used to treat fungal infections), \no telmisartan (used to treat high blood pressure) \no or any other medicines (including those you can buy without a prescription) that your doctor \n\ndoes not know about? \n• Do you need to receive vaccines (live vaccines)? Your doctor will have to advise you what is \n\nindicated for you. \n \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in women taking Myfenax \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use an effective method of contraception \nwith Myfenax. This includes: \n• Before you start taking Myfenax \n• During your entire treatment with Myfenax \n• For 6 weeks after you stop taking Myfenax. \nTalk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual \nsituation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended \npregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not \nhave been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \nYou are a woman who is not capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following applies to you: \n• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago \n\n(if your periods have stopped because you have treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance you \ncould become pregnant). \n\n• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-\noophorectomy). \n\n• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy). \n• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist \n\ngynaecologist). \n• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY \n\ngenotype, Turner`s syndrome or uterine agenesis. \n• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. \n \nContraception in men taking Myfenax \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \nfather takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or \nyour female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days \nafter you stop taking Myfenax. \n \nIf you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative \ntherapies. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about \nthe risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant \norgan if: \n• You plan to become pregnant. \n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect \n\nyou are pregnant. \n• You have sex without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor \nimmediately. However, keep taking Myfenax until you see him or her. \n \nPregnancy \nMycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects \n(23-27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of \neyes, of face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the \nthroat with the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of \nthe spine are not properly developed)).Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before \nstarting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor \nmay request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take Myfenax if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into the mother’s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMyfenax has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndrowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you feel better. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nMyfenax contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Myfenax \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYour treatment is started and monitored by a doctor who is specialised in transplants. \n \nThe usual way to take Myfenax is as follows: \n \nKidney Transplant \n \nAdults \nThe first dose will be given within 72 hours after the transplant operation. The recommended daily \ndose is 8 capsules (2 g of the active ingredient) taken as 2 separate doses. This means taking 4 \ncapsules in the morning then 4 capsules in the evening. \n \nChildren and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) \nThe dose given will vary depending on the size of the child. Your doctor will decide the most \nappropriate dose based on body surface area (height and weight). The recommended dose is \n600 mg/m2 taken twice a day. \n \nHeart Transplant \n \nAdults \nThe first dose will be given within 5 days following the transplant operation. The recommended daily \ndose is 12 capsules (3 g of the active ingredient) taken as 2 separate doses. This means taking 6 \ncapsules in the morning then 6 capsules in the evening. \n \nChildren \nThere is no information for the use of Myfenax in children with a heart transplant. \n \nLiver Transplant \n \nAdults \nThe first dose of oral Myfenax will be given to you at least 4 days after the transplant operation and \nwhen you are able to swallow oral medicines. The recommended daily dose is 12 capsules (3 g of the \nactive ingredient) taken as 2 separate doses. This means taking 6 capsules in the morning then \n6 capsules in the evening. \n \nChildren \nThere is no information for the use of Myfenax in children with a liver transplant. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nSwallow your capsules whole with a glass of water. You can take them with or without food. Do not \nbreak or crush them and do not take any capsules that have broken open or split. Avoid contact with \nany powder that spills out from damaged capsules. If a capsule breaks open accidentally, wash any \npowder from your skin with soap and water. If any powder gets into your eyes or mouth, rinse \nthoroughly with plenty of plain, fresh water. \n \nTreatment will continue for you as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent your body from \nrejecting your transplanted organ. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nIf you take more Myfenax than you should \nIt is important not to take too many capsules. Contact your nearest hospital Accident and Emergency \ndepartment or a doctor for advice if you have swallowed more capsules than you have been told to \ntake or if you think a child has swallowed any. \n \nIf you forget to take Myfenax \nIf you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember, then continue to take \nit at the usual times. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Myfenax \nDo not stop taking Myfenax because you feel better. It is important to take the medicine for as long as \nthe doctor has told you to. Stopping your treatment with Myfenax may increase the chance of rejection \nof your transplanted organ. Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What Myfenax is and what it is used for \n \nMyfenax is a medicine that is used to suppress immune activity. \n \nThe active substance in this medicine is called mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nMyfenax is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted kidney, heart or liver. It is used in \ncombination with other medicines with a similar function (i.e. ciclosporin and corticosteroids). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Myfenax \n \nWARNING \nMycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, \nyou must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the \ncontraception advice given to you by your doctor. \nYour doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of \nmycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. \nIf you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before \nyou take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and \nprecautions” and “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding”. \n \nDo not take Myfenax, \n• if you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test \n\nbefore your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. \n• if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant. \n• if you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). \n• if you are breast-feeding. \nDo not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Myfenax. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with Myfenax: \n• if you experience any evidence of infection (e.g. fever, sore throat), unexpected bruising and/or \n\nbleeding. \n• if you have or ever have had any problems with your digestive system, e.g. stomach ulcers. \n• if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking \n\nMyfenax. \n \nMyfenax reduces your body’s defence mechanism. Because of this, there is an increased risk of skin \ncancer. Therefore you should limit your exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light by wearing \nappropriate protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nYou must not donate blood during treatment with Myfenax and for at least 6 weeks after stopping \ntreatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with Myfenax and for at least 90 days after \nstopping treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nMyfenax is used in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) to prevent a body rejecting a transplanted \nkidney. \nMyfenax should not be used in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) for heart or liver \ntransplantation. \nMyfenax should not be used at all in children under 2 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Myfenax \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIf you answer yes to any of the following questions talk to your doctor before you start to take \nMyfenax: \n• Are you taking any medicines containing: \n\no azathioprine or other immunosuppressive agents (which are sometimes given to patients after a \ntransplant operation), \n\no cholestyramine (used to treat patients with high blood cholesterol), \no rifampicin (antibiotic), \no antacids or proton pump inhibitors (used for acid problem in your stomach such as indigestion), \no phosphate binders (used in patients with chronic kidney failure to reduce the absorption of \n\nphosphate), \no antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections), \no isavuconazole (used to treat fungal infections), \no telmisartan (used to treat high blood pressure) \no or any other medicines (including those you can buy without a prescription) that your doctor \n\ndoes not know about? \n• Do you need to receive vaccines (live vaccines)? Your doctor will have to advise you what is \n\nindicated for you. \n \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in women taking Myfenax \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use an effective method of contraception \nwith Myfenax. This includes: \n• Before you start taking Myfenax \n• During your entire treatment with Myfenax \n• For 6 weeks after you stop taking Myfenax. \nTalk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual \nsituation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended \npregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not \nhave been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \nYou are a woman who is not capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following applies to you: \n• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago \n\n(if your periods have stopped because you have treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance you \ncould become pregnant). \n\n• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-\noophorectomy). \n\n• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy). \n• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist \n\ngynaecologist). \n• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY \n\ngenotype, Turner`s syndrome or uterine agenesis. \n• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. \n \nContraception in men taking Myfenax \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \nfather takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or \nyour female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days \nafter you stop taking Myfenax. \n \nIf you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative \ntherapies. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about \nthe risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant \norgan if: \n• You plan to become pregnant. \n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect \n\nyou are pregnant. \n• You have sex without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor \nimmediately. However, keep taking Myfenax until you see him or her. \n \nPregnancy \nMycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects \n(23-27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of \neyes, of face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the \nthroat with the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of \nthe spine are not properly developed)).Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before \nstarting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor \nmay request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take Myfenax if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into the mother’s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMyfenax has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndrowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you feel better. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nMyfenax contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3.
