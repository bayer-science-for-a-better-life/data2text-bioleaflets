NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan 200 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 200 mg of ribavirin.  \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: each hard capsule contains 15 mg of lactose monohydrate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nWhite opaque body imprinted \"riba/200\" in green and a white opaque cap imprinted \"riba/200\" in \n\ngreen. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and must only be used as \n\npart of a combination regimen with interferon alfa-2b (adults, children (3 years of age and older) and \n\nadolescents).  Ribavirin monotherapy must not be used.  \n\n \n\nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e., \n\nnot alfa-2b). \n\n \n\nPlease refer also to the interferon alfa-2b Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for prescribing \n\ninformation particular to that product. \n\n \n\nNaïve patients \n\nAdult Patients (18 years of age or older): Ribavirin Mylan is indicated in combination with interferon \n\nalfa-2b, for the treatment of adult patients with all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not \n\npreviously treated without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), who \n\nare positive for serum HCV-RNA (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents): Ribavirin Mylan is indicated, \n\nin a combination regimen with interferon alfa-2b, for the treatment of children and adolescents 3 years \n\nof age and older, who have all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previously treated, \n\nwithout liver decompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA.  When deciding not to \n\ndefer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy can induce a \n\ngrowth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a \n\ncase by case basis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPreviously treatment failure patients \n\nAdult patients: Ribavirin Mylan is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, for the treatment \n\nof adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have previously responded (with normalisation of ALT \n\nat the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have subsequently relapsed (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment should be initiated, and monitored, by a physician experienced in the management of \n\nchronic hepatitis C.  \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan must be used in combination with interferon alfa-2b. \n\n \n\nPlease refer also to the interferon alfa-2b Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for prescribing \n\ninformation particular to that product. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan must be used in combination therapy as described in section 4.1. \n\nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of medicinal products \n\nused in combination with ribavirin for additional prescribing information particular to that product and \n\nfor further dosage recommendations on co-administration with ribavirin.  \n\n \n\nRibavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses (morning and evening) \n\nwith food.  \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose and duration of ribavirin depends on patient’s weight and on the medicinal \n\nproduct that is used in combination. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products \n\nused in combination with ribavirin.  \n\n \n\nIn the cases in which no specific dose recommendation is made, the following dose should be used: \n\nPatient weight: < 75 kg = 1,000 mg and > 75 kg = 1,200 mg. \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan must be used in combination with interferon alfa-2b (3 million international units \n\n[MIU] three times a week). \n\n \n\nThe regimen administered should be selected based on the anticipated efficacy and safety of the \n\ncombination treatment for an individual patient (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b: \n\n \n\nBased on the results of clinical trials, it is recommended that patients be treated for at least six months.  \n\nDuring those clinical trials in which patients were treated for one year, patients who failed to show a \n\nvirological response after six months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) were \n\nunlikely to become sustained virological responders (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection six \n\nmonths after withdrawal of treatment). \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment – Naïve patients  \n\n \n\n• Genotypes Non-1: The decision to extend therapy to one year in patients with negative HCV-\nRNA after six months of treatment should be based on other prognostic factors (e.g., age >40 \n\nyears, male gender, bridging fibrosis). \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment – Retreatment \n\n \n\n• Genotype 1: Treatment should be continued for another six month period (i.e., a total of one year) \nin patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA after six months of treatment. \n\n \n\n• Genotypes Non-1: The decision to extend therapy to one year in patients with negative HCVRNA \nafter six months of treatment should be based on other prognostic factors (e.g., age > 40 years, \n\nmale gender, bridging fibrosis). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nNo data are available in children below 3 years of age. \n\n \n\nNote: For patients who weigh < 47 kg, or are unable to swallow capsules, ribavirin oral solution is \n\navailable and should be used if appropriate. \n\n \n\nDosing of ribavirin for children and adolescent patients is determined by the patient body weight. For \n\nexample, the body weight dosing used in conjunction with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b \n\nis shown in Table 1. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in \n\ncombination with ribavirin as some combination regimens do not adhere to the ribavirin dosing \n\nguidance provided in Table 1.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies performed in this population ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b were used in doses of \n\n15 mg/kg/day and 3 million international units (MIU)/m2 three times a week respectively (Table 1).   \n\n \n\nTable 1 Ribavirin Mylan dose based on body weight when used in combination with interferon \n\nalfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b in paediatric patients \n\nPatient weight (kg) Daily Ribavirin dose Number of 200 mg capsules \n\n47 - 49 600 mg 3 capsules a \n\n50 - 65 800 mg 4 capsules b \n\n>65 Refer to adult dose recommendations  \na1 morning, 2 evening  \nb2 morning, 2 evening  \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment in children and adolescents \n\n \n\n• Genotype 2 or 3:  The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.  \n \n\n  \n\nDose modification for adverse reactions \n\n \n\nDose modification for adults \n\nDose reduction of ribavirin depends on the initial ribavirin posology which depends on the medicinal \n\nproduct that is used in combination with ribavirin. \n\n \n\nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the dose should be modified \n\nor discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. \n\n \n\nTable 2 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient’s \n\nhaemoglobin concentration, cardiac status and indirect bilirubin concentration. \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 2 Management of Adverse Reactions \n\nLaboratory Values  Reduce Ribavirin Mylan \n\ndose* \n\n if: \n\nReduce only interferon \n\nalfa-2b dose (see note 2) \n\nif:  \n\nDiscontinue Ribavirin \n\nMylan if:  \n\nHaemoglobin in patients \n\nwith No Cardiac \n\nDisease \n\n< 10 g/dl  -  < 8.5 g/dL  \n\nHaemoglobin: Patients \n\nwith History of Stable \n\nCardiac Disease  \n\n≥ 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin during any 4 week \n\nperiod during treatment (permanent dose reduction)  \n\n< 12 g/dL despite 4 \n\nweeks at reduced dose \n\nBilirubin - Indirect > 5 mg/dL > 4 mg/dL (adults) \n\n* For patients receiving a 1,000 mg (< 75 kg) or 1,200 mg (> 75 kg) dose, ribavirin dose should be \n\nreduced to 600 mg/day (administered as one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules \n\nin the evening). If the abnormality is reversed, ribavirin may be restarted at 600 mg daily, and further \n\nincreased to 800 mg daily at the discretion of the treating physician. However, a return to higher doses \n\nis not recommended. \n\nFor patients receiving a 800 mg (< 65 kg)-1,000 mg (65-80 kg)-1,200 mg (81-105 kg) or 1,400 mg  \n\n(> 105 kg) dose, 1st dose reduction of Ribavirin Mylan is by 200 mg/day (except in patients receiving \n\nthe 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, 2nd dose reduction of Ribavirin \n\nMylan is by an additional 200 mg/day. Patients whose dose of Ribavirin Mylan is reduced to 600 mg \n\ndaily receive one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules in the evening.  \n\nIn children and adolescent patients treated with Ribavirin Mylan plus interferon alfa-2b, reduce \n\nRibavirin Mylan dose to 7.5 mg/kg/day. \n\nNote 2: In adult patients and children and adolescent patients treated with Ribavirin Mylan plus \n\ninterferon alfa-2b, reduce the interferon alfa-2b dose by one-half dose. \n\n \n\nIn case of serious adverse reaction potentially related to medicinal products used in combination with \n\nRibavirin Mylan, refer to the corresponding SmPC of these medicinal products as some combination \n\nregimens do not adhere to the ribavirin dose modification and/or discontinuation guidelines as \n\ndescribed in Table 2. \n\n \n\nDose modification for paediatric patients \n\nDose reduction in paediatric patients without cardiac disease follows the same guidelines as adult \n\npatients without cardiac disease regarding haemoglobin levels (Table 2). \n\n \n\nThere are no data for paediatric patients with cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 3 provides guidelines for discontinuation based on the patient’s indirect bilirubin concentration. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Management of Adverse Reactions \n\nLaboratory Values Discontinue Ribavirin Mylan if:  \n\nBilirubin - Indirect > 5 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n\n(children and adolescents treated with interferon alfa-2b) \n\nor   \n\n> 4 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n\n(children and adolescents treated with peginterferon alfa-2b) \n\n  \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nElderly (≥ 65 years of age) \n\nThere does not appear to be a significant age-related effect on the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin.  \n\nHowever, as in younger patients, renal function must be determined prior to administration of \n\nRibavirin Mylan (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents) \n\nRibavirin Mylan may be used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b (see \n\nsection 4.4).   \n\nThe selection of formulation is based on individual characteristics of the patient. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ribavirin used together with direct-acting-anti-virals in these patients has \n\nnot been established. No data are available. \n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin for \n\nfurther dosage recommendations on co-administration.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \n\napparent creatinine clearance in these patients (see section 5.2). Therefore, it is recommended that \n\nrenal function be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of Ribavirin Mylan. Adult patients with \n\nmoderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/minute) should be administered \n\nalternating daily doses of 200 mg and 400 mg. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance of < 30 mL/minute) and patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or on haemodialysis \n\nshould be administered Ribavirin Mylan 200 mg/day. Table 4 provides guidelines for dose \n\nmodification for patients with renal dysfunction.  Patients with impaired renal function should be more \n\ncarefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.  If serum creatinine rises to > 2 mg/dl \n\n(Table 2) Ribavirin Mylan and interferon alfa-2b must be discontinued. No data are available \n\nregarding dose modification for paediatric patients with renal impairment.  \n\n \n\nTable 4 Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment in Adult Patients \n\nCreatinine Clearance  Ribavirin Mylan Dose (daily) \n\n30 to 50 mL/min Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day \n\nLess than 30 mL/min 200 mg daily \n\nHaemodialysis (ESRD) 200 mg daily \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction appears between ribavirin and hepatic function (see section 5.2).  For \n\nuse in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, see the corresponding SmPC of the medicinal products \n\nused in combination with Ribavirin Mylan. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (patients under the age of 18 years):  Ribavirin Mylan may be used in \n\ncombination with interferon alfa-2b in children (3 years of age and older) and adolescents.  The \n\nselection of formulation is based on individual characteristics of the patient (see section 4.1).  Safety \n\nand effectiveness of Ribavirin Mylan with pegylated or other forms of interferon (i.e. not alfa-2b) in \n\nthese patients have not been evaluated. \n\n    \n\nPatients co-infected with HCV/HIV: Patients taking NRTI treatment in association with ribavirin and \n\ninterferon alfa-2b may be at increased risk of mitochondrial toxicity, lactic acidosis and hepatic \n\ndecompensation (see section 4.4).  Please refer also to the relevant product information for \n\nantiretroviral medicinal products. \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan should be administered orally with food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n- Pregnancy (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3).  In females of childbearing potential, Ribavirin Mylan \n\nmust not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately \n\nprior to initiation of therapy.  \n\n- Breast-feeding. \n\n- History of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac \n\ndisease, in the previous six months (see section 4.4).  \n\n- Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia).  \n\nInitiation of peginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-\n\nPugh score ≥ 6. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents: \n\nExistence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation, or suicide attempt.  \n\n \n\nBecause of co-administration with interferon alfa-2b:  \n\n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS):  \n\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \n\nobserved in some patients during Ribavirin combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b or \n\ninterferon alfa-2b, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up \n\nperiod. Among children and adolescents, treated with Ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-\n\n2b, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4% \n\nversus 1%) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, \n\nchildren and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., depression, emotional \n\nlability, and somnolence).  Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed \n\nagainst others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorder, mania, confusion and alterations of mental \n\nstatus have been observed with alpha interferons.  Patients should be closely monitored for any signs \n\nor symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these \n\nundesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \n\ntherapeutic management should be considered.  If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \n\nideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with Ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b or \n\ninterferon alfa-2b be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as \n\nappropriate.  \n\n \n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:  If treatment with Ribavirin in \n\ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with \n\nexistence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured \n\nappropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.   \n\n- The use of Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents with \n\nexistence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPatients with substance use/abuse: \n\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \n\nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric \n\ndisorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in \n\nthese patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use \n\nshould be carefully assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-\n\ndisciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be \n\nconsidered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during \n\ntherapy and even after treatment discontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development \n\nof psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: Growth and development: \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in \n\npatients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common. Long-term data \n\navailable in children treated with the combination therapy of pegylated interferon/ribavirin are \n\nindicative of substantial growth retardation. Thirty two percent (30/94) of subjects demonstrated > 15 \n\npercentile decrease in height-for-age percentile 5 years after completion of therapy (see sections 4.8 \n\nand 5.1).  \n\nThe longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard \n\ninterferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile decrease in \n\nheight percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % (n=20) of children despite being off treatment for \n\nmore than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and show that 12 \n\ncontinued to have height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. \n\n \n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children: \n\nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \n\nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n−  It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted \n\nin reduced height in some patients. \n\n−  This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of \n\ndisease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease \n\nprogression (such as HIV-co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (HCV \n\ngenotype and viral load). \n\n \n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \n\nrisk of growth inhibition. Although data are limited, no evidence of long-term effects on sexual \n\nmaturation was noted in the 5 year observational follow-up study. \n\n \n\nBased on results of clinical trials, the use of ribavirin as monotherapy is not effective and Ribavirin \n\nmust not be used alone.  The safety and efficacy of this combination have been established only using \n\nribavirin capsules together with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b solution for injection.  \n\n \n\nAll patients in selected chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain \n\ncases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological \n\nconfirmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed \n\nprior to commencing treatment. \n\n \n\nHaemolysis \n\nA decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/dl was observed in up to 14% of adult patients and 7% of \n\nchildren and adolescents treated with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \n\nalfa-2b in clinical trials. Although ribavirin has no direct cardiovascular effects, anaemia associated \n\nwith ribavirin may result in deterioration of cardiac function, or exacerbation of the symptoms of \n\ncoronary disease, or both. Thus, Ribavirin Mylan must be administered with caution to patients with \n\npre-existing cardiac disease (see section 4.3). Cardiac status must be assessed before start of therapy \n\nand monitored clinically during therapy; if any deterioration occurs, therapy must be stopped (see \n\nsection 4.2).  \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \n\ncurrent arrhythmic disorders must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who \n\nhave pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course \n\nof treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy \n\nbut may require discontinuation of therapy.  There are no data in children or adolescents with a history \n\nof cardiac disease.  \n\n \n\nTeratogenic risk \n\nPrior to initiation of treatment with ribavirin the physician must comprehensively inform both male \n\nand female patients of the teratogenic risk of ribavirin, the necessity of effective and continuous \n\n\n\n9 \n\ncontraception, the possibility that contraceptive methods may fail and the possible consequences of \n\npregnancy should it occur during or following treatment with ribavirin (see section 4.6). For laboratory \n\nmonitoring of pregnancy, please refer to Laboratory tests. \n\n \n\nAcute hypersensitivity \n\nIf an acute hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) \n\ndevelops, Ribavirin Mylan must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy \n\ninstituted. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.  \n\n \n\nOcular changes: Ribavirin is used in combination therapy with alpha interferons. Retinopathy \n\nincluding retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, papilloedema, optic neuropathy and retinal artery or \n\nvein occlusion which may result in loss of vision have been reported in rare instances with \n\ncombination therapy with alpha interferons.  All patients should have a baseline eye examination.  \n\nAny patient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have a prompt and complete eye \n\nexamination. Patients with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive \n\nretinopathy) should receive periodic ophthalmologic exams during combination therapy with alpha \n\ninterferons. Combination therapy with alpha interferons should be discontinued in patients who \n\ndevelop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.  \n\n \n\nLiver function \n\nAny patient developing significant liver function abnormalities during treatment must be monitored \n\nclosely. Discontinue treatment in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which \n\nmight indicate liver decompensation. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products \n\nused in combination with ribavirin for discontinuation or dose modification recommendations.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \n\napparent clearance in these patients. Therefore, it is recommended that renal function be evaluated in \n\nall patients prior to initiation of ribavirin. Due to substantial increases in ribavirin plasma \n\nconcentrations in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, Ribavirin Mylan dose \n\nadjustments are recommended in adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute. No data are \n\navailable regarding dose modification for paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 5.2). Haemoglobin concentrations should be monitored closely during treatment and corrective \n\naction taken as necessary (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPotential to exacerbate immunosuppression \n\nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 \n\nweeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This \n\nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \n\nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents: Approximately 12% to 21% of \n\nchildren treated with Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and non-pegylated) developed \n\nincrease in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another approximately 4% had a transient decrease \n\nbelow the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of interferon alfa-2b therapy, TSH levels must be \n\nevaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy.  \n\nInterferon alfa-2b (pegylated and non-pegylated) therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be \n\nmaintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with Ribavirin \n\nand interferon alfa-2b and during treatment with Ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b has been \n\nobserved. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and \n\ntreated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for \n\nevidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nHCV/HIV Co-infection  \n\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:  \n\nCaution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside \n\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon \n\nalfa-2b/ribavirin treatment.  In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians \n\nshould carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when ribavirin is \n\nadministered. For additional details see section 4.5.  \n\n \n\nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis  \n\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) may \n\nbe at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone \n\nor in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Other baseline factors in \n\nco-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include \n\ntreatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentrations.  \n\nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \n\nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC \n\nof medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin for discontinuation or dose modification \n\nrecommendations. Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis \n\ntreatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.  \n\n \n\nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients  \n\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and cART may be \n\nat increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \n\nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be managed \n\nby dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this \n\npopulation of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8).  \n\nPatients treated with ribavirin and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, \n\nthe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients with low CD4 counts  \n\nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \n\nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \n\npatients with low CD4 counts.  \n\n \n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \n\nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \n\nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b.  \n\n \n\nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, \n\nhave been reported in patients receiving Ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \n\ncombination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous \n\nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Ribavirin and \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and \n\nhave regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction \n\noccurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.  \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistries (complete blood count [CBC] and differential, platelet \n\ncount, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid) and pregnancy tests must be \n\nconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy.  Acceptable baseline values that may be considered \n\nas a guideline prior to initiation of Ribavirin Mylan therapy:  \n\n \n\n• Haemoglobin Adult: ≥ 12g/dL (females); ≥ 13g/dL (males) \nChildren and adolescents: ≥ 11g/dL (females); ≥ 12g/dL (males) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \n\nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nUric acid may increase with Ribavirin Mylan due to haemolysis; therefore, the potential for \n\ndevelopment of gout must be carefully monitored in pre-disposed patients.  \n\n \n\nInformation on excipients \n\nEach Ribavirin Mylan hard capsule contains 15 mg of lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare \n\nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \n\nmalabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\nResults of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated no \n\ncytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of ribavirin.  Ribavirin does not inhibit cytochrome \n\nP450 enzymes.  There is no evidence from toxicity studies that ribavirin induces liver enzymes. \n\nTherefore, there is a minimal potential for P450 enzyme-based interactions.  \n\n \n\nRibavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere \n\nwith azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine \n\nmonophosphate (6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with \n\nazathioprine. The use of pegylated alpha interferons and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine \n\nshould be avoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with \n\nazathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done \n\nduring concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with \n\nthese medicines should be stopped (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been conducted with ribavirin and other medicinal products, except for \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2b and antacids.  \n\n \n\nInterferon alfa-2b: No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ribavirin and peginterferon \n\nalfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.  \n\n \n\nAntacid \n\nThe bioavailability of ribavirin 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid containing \n\nmagnesium aluminium and simethicone; AUCtf decreased 14%. It is possible that the decreased \n\nbioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH.  This interaction is \n\nnot considered to be clinically relevant.  \n\n \n\nNucleoside analogues \n\nUse of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic \n\nacidosis. Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \n\nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n\n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of Ribavirin Mylan and didanosine is not \n\nrecommended. Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of \n\nwhich some fatal, have been reported (see section 4.4).  \n\nThe exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \n\nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \n\nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \n\nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n\n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a \n\nknown history of zidovudine induced anaemia.  \n\n \n\nAny potential for interactions may persist for up to two months (five half-lives for ribavirin) after \n\ncessation of Ribavirin Mylan therapy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2).  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that ribavirin interacts with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or \n\nprotease inhibitors. \n\n \n\nConflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and ribavirin. \n\nSome data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at \n\nrisk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen both medicines are co-administered. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nFemale patients \n\nRibavirin Mylan must not be used by females who are pregnant (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). Extreme \n\ncare must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients (see section 5.3). Ribavirin Mylan therapy \n\nmust not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to \n\ninitiation of therapy. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during \n\ntreatment and for four months after treatment has been concluded; routine monthly pregnancy tests \n\nmust be performed during this time. If pregnancy does occur during treatment or within four months \n\nfrom stopping treatment, the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic risk of ribavirin to \n\nthe foetus (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nMale patients and their female partners \n\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in partners of male patients taking Ribavirin Mylan \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3).  Ribavirin accumulates intracellularly and is cleared from the body very \n\nslowly.  It is unknown whether the ribavirin that is contained in sperm will exert its potential \n\nteratogenic or genotoxic effects on the human embryo/foetus.  Although data on approximately 300 \n\nprospectively followed pregnancies with paternal exposure to ribavirin have not shown an increased \n\nrisk of malformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern of malformation, \n\neither male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to use an effective \n\ncontraceptive during treatment with Ribavirin Mylan and for seven months after treatment. Routine \n\nmonthly pregnancy tests must be performed during this time. Men whose partners are pregnant must \n\nbe instructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of ribavirin to the partner.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThe use of Ribavirin Mylan is contraindicated during pregnancy. Ribavirin has been shown in \n\npreclinical studies to be teratogenic and genotoxic see section 4.4 and 5.3).  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether ribavirin is excreted in human milk.  Because of the potential for adverse \n\nreactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nPreclinical data \n\n- Fertility: In animal studies, ribavirin produced reversible effects on spermatogenesis (see \nsection 5.3).  \n\n- Teratogenicity: Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential have been demonstrated for \nribavirin in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted, occurring at \n\ndoses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose (see section 5.3).  \n\n- Genotoxicity: ribavirin induces genotoxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines; however, \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b used in combination may have an effect.  Thus, patients \n\n\n\n13 \n\nwho develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment must be cautioned to avoid driving or \n\noperating machinery. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nThe salient safety issue of ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia occurring within the first weeks of therapy. \n\nThe haemolytic anaemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in deterioration of cardiac \n\nfunction and/or worsening of pre-existing cardiac disease. An increase in uric acid and indirect \n\nbilirubin values associated with haemolysis were also observed in some patients. \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed in this section are primarily derived from clinical trials and/or as adverse \n\ndrug reactions from spontaneous reports when ribavirin was used in combination with interferon alfa-\n\n2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products that are used in combination with \n\nribavirin for additional undesirable effects reported with these products. \n\n \n\nAdults  \n\n \n\nBitherapy with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \n\nThe safety of ribavirin is evaluated from data from four clinical trials in patients with no previous \n\nexposure to interferon (interferon-naïve patients): two trials studied ribavirin capsules in combination \n\nwith interferon alfa-2b, two trials studied ribavirin capsules in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.  \n\n \n\nPatients who are treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin after previous relapse from interferon \n\ntherapy or who are treated for a shorter period are likely to have an improved safety profile than that \n\ndescribed below.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions for adults \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 5 are based on experience from clinical trials in adult naïve \n\npatients treated for 1 year and post-marketing use. A certain number of adverse reactions, generally \n\nattributed to interferon therapy but that have been reported in the context of hepatitis C therapy (in \n\ncombination with ribavirin) are also listed for reference in Table 5.  Also, refer to peginterferon alfa-\n\n2b and interferon alfa-2b SmPCs for adverse reactions that may be attributable to interferons \n\nmonotherapy. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of \n\nfrequency using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known. \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n\n \nTable

There \n\nwere some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with ribavirin capsules in combination \n\nwith peginterferon alfa-2b (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21%]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of 186 [7%]); \n\nWHO grade 3 leukopenia was also reported in 7% of this treatment group.  \n\n \n\nAn increase in uric acid and indirect bilirubin values associated with haemolysis was observed in some \n\npatients treated with ribavirin used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b in \n\nclinical trials, but values returned to baseline levels by four weeks after the end of therapy.  Among \n\nthose patients with elevated uric acid levels, very few patients treated with the combination developed \n\nclinical gout, none of which required treatment modification or discontinuation from the clinical trials.  \n\n \n\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \n\nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, other \n\nadverse reactions (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \n\nstudies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 \n\nlymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), \n\nback pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis \n\n(6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).  \n\n \n\nMitochondrial toxicity \n\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \n\nregimen and associated-ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients: \n\nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \n\nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \n\nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological abnormalities \n\nwere more frequently reported in patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-\n\n2b when compared to patients receiving ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b. In Study 1 \n\n(see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in \n\n4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of \n\npatients receiving ribavirin capsules in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.  Anaemia \n\n(haemoglobin < 9.4 g/dl) was reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with ribavirin in \n\ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b.  \n\n \n\nCD4 lymphocytes decrease \n\nTreatment with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b was associated with decreases in \n\nabsolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The \n\ndecrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of \n\nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b had no observable negative impact on the control \n\nof HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N = 25) are available in co-infected \n\npatients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µl (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \n\nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \n\nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. \n\n  \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \n\nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with \n\ncombination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % \n\n\n\n17 \n\nof patients, most commonly for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse \n\nreactions profile in children and adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a \n\npaediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to \n\n48 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted \n\nin reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight loss and growth inhibition were very \n\ncommon during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from baseline in weight and in \n\nheight percentiles were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth velocity was \n\ninhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients). \n\n \n\nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \n\npercentiles were still 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles, respectively, and 20% of the children continued \n\nto have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety-four of 107 children enrolled in the \n\n5 year long-term follow-up trial. The effects on growth were less in those children treated for 24 \n\nweeks than those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up among \n\nchildren treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 9.0 percentiles, \n\nrespectively. Twenty-four percent of children (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of children \n\n(19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment to the \n\nend of 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of \n\nchildren (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of children (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were observed to \n\nhave a decrease from pre-treatment baseline > 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end of the 5 year \n\nlong-term follow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-for-age \n\npercentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, \n\nrespectively. For BMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, BMI-for-age percentiles \n\ndecreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. \n\nDecrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up was most prominent in \n\nprepubertal age children. The decline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the \n\ntreatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term \n\nfollow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n\n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site \n\nerythema (29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction \n\n(thrombocytopenia). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in \n\nseverity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection \n\nsite pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). \n\nImportant treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were \n\nnervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and \n\nhypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated \n\nTSH.  \n\n \n\nIn combination with interferon alfa-2b \n\nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age treated with combination therapy \n\nof interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, 6% discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions.  In general, the \n\nadverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that \n\nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as \n\ndecrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean \n\npercentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment Within the 5 years follow-up \n\npost-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44th percentile, which was below the median \n\nof the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) \n\nof 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a \n\n> 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term \n\nfollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated \n\nthat 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. \n\nDuring combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition \n\nwas observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in \n\n\n\n18 \n\nmean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-term follow-up was most prominent in \n\nprepubertal age children (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n\n(2.4% vs 1%) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment.  As in adult patients, \n\nchildren and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., depression, \n\nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4).  In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \n\nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \n\ncompared to adult patients.  Dose modifications were required in 30% of patients, most commonly for \n\nanaemia and neutropenia. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in paediatric population  \n\n \n\nReported adverse reactions listed in Table 6 are based on experience from the two multicentre \n\nchildren and adolescents clinical trials using ribavirin with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \n\nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \n\nfollowing categories: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \n\nto <1/100).  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \n\nseriousness.  \n\n \n\nTable 6 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported during clinical trials in \n\nchildren and adolescents with ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon \n\nalfa-2b \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nAdverse Reactions \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common: Viral infection, pharyngitis \n\nCommon: Fungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, nasopharyngitis, \n\npharyngitis streptococcal,  otitis media, sinusitis, tooth abscess, influenza, oral \n\nherpes,  herpes simplex, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, gastroenteritis \n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \n\nCommon: Neoplasm unspecified \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery common: Anaemia, neutropenia \n\nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy \n\n \n\nEndocrine disorders \n\nVery common: Hypothyroidism \n\nCommon: Hyperthyroidism, virilism \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common: Anorexia, increased appetite, decreased appetite \n\nCommon: Hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nVery common: Depression, insomnia, emotional lability \n\nCommon: Suicidal ideation, aggression, confusion, affect liability, behaviour disorder, \n\nagitation, somnambulism, anxiety, mood altered, restlessness, nervousness, sleep \n\ndisorder, abnormal dreaming, apathy \n\nUncommon: Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, fear, nightmare \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common: Headache, dizziness \n\n\n\n19 \n\nCommon: Hyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, hypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, \n\nconcentration impaired, somnolence, disturbance in attention, poor quality of sleep \n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, psychomotor hyperactivity \n\nEye disorders \n\nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland disorder \n\nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision blurred, photophobia \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nCommon: Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon: Tachycardia, palpitations \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon: Pallor, flushing  \n\nUncommon: Hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, nasal irritation, \n\nrhinorrhoea, sneezing, pharyngolaryngeal pain \n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea  \n\nCommon: Mouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, dyspepsia, \n\ncheilosis, glossitis, gastroesophoageal reflux, rectal disorder, gastrointestinal \n\ndisorder, constipation, loose stools, toothache, tooth disorder, stomach discomfort, \n\noral pain \n\nUncommon: Gingivitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal \n\nUncommon: Hepatomegaly \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common: Alopecia, rash \n\nCommon: Pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, eczema, hyperhidrosis, \n\nacne, skin disorder, nail disorder, skin discolouration, dry skin, erythema, bruise  \n\nUncommon: Pigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin exfoliation \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \n\nCommon: Pain in extremity, back pain, muscle contracture \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence, proteinuria \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, vaginal disorder, Male: \n\ntesticular pain \n\nUncommon: Female: dysmenorrhoea \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common: Fatigue, rigors, pyrexia, influenza-like illness, asthenia, malaise, irritability \n\nCommon: Chest pain, oedema, pain, feeling cold \n\nUncommon: Chest discomfort, facial pain \n\nInvestigations \n\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age) \n\nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin increased \n\nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive \n\n\n\n20 \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nCommon: Skin laceration \n\nUncommon: Contusion \n\n \n\nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the ribavirin /peginterferon alfa-2b clinical trial were mild \n\nor moderate.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, nucleosides and nucleotides excl. reverse \n\ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AB04.  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nRibavirin (Ribavirin Mylan) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue which has shown in vitro activity \n\nagainst some RNA and DNA viruses.  The mechanism by which ribavirin in combination with \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b exerts its effects against HCV is unknown.  Oral \n\nformulations of ribavirin monotherapy have been investigated as therapy for chronic hepatitis C in \n\nseveral clinical trials.  Results of these investigations showed that ribavirin monotherapy had no effect \n\non eliminating hepatitis virus (HCV-RNA) or improving hepatic histology after 6 to 12 months of \n\ntherapy and 6 months of follow-up.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nRibavirin in combination with Direct Antiviral Agent (DAA): \n\nPlease refer to the SmPC of the corresponding DAA for a full description of the clinical data with such \n\ncombination. \n\nOnly the description of the use of ribavirin from the original development with (peg)interferon alfa-2b \n\nis detailed in the current SmPC. \nBitherapy with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b: \n\nThe use of ribavirin in combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b was \n\nevaluated in a number of clinical trials.  Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C \n\nconfirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 30 IU/ml), a liver \n\nbiopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic \n\nhepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.  \n\n \n\nNaïve patients \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\nThree trials examined the use of interferon in naïve patients, two with ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b \n\n(C95-132 and I95-143) and one with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b (C/I98-580).  In all cases the \n\ntreatment was for one year with a follow-up of six months.  The sustained response at the end of \n\nfollow-up was significantly increased by the addition of ribavirin capsules to interferon alfa-2b (41% \n\nvs 16%, p < 0.001).  \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials C95-132 and I95-143, ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination therapy proved to be \n\nsignificantly more effective than interferon alfa-2b monotherapy (a doubling in sustained response).  \n\nCombination therapy also decreased the relapse rate.  This was true for all HCV genotypes, \n\nparticularly Genotype 1, in which the relapse rate was reduced by 30% compared with interferon alfa-\n\n2b monotherapy.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical trial C/I98-580, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following \n\ncombination regimens:  \n\n• Ribavirin (800 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) (n=511).  \n\n• Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one \nmonth followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) (n=514).  \n\n• Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) (n=505).  \n \n\nIn this trial, the combination of ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) was \n\nsignificantly more effective than the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b, particularly in \n\npatients infected with Genotype 1. Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months \n\nafter the cessation of treatment.  \n\n \n\nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.  \n\nHowever, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin \n\nadministered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b.  In those patients that \n\nreceived >10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral \n\nload, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg \n\nRibavirin (Table 7), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even \n\nhigher.  \n\n \nTable 7 Sustained response rates with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b (By ribavirin dose \n\n[mg/kg], genotype and viral load) \n\nHCV Genotype Ribavirin Dose \n\n(mg/kg) \n\nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R \n\n \n\nI/R \n\n \n\nAll Genotypes All 54 % 47 % 47 % \n\n≤ 10.6 50 % 41 % 27 % \n\n> 10.6 61 % 48 % 47 % \n\nGenotype 1 All 42 % 34 % 33 % \n\n≤ 10.6 38 % 25 % 20 % \n\n> 10.6 48 % 34 % 34 % \n\nGenotype 1  \n\n≤ 600,000 IU/ml \n\nAll 73 % 51 % 45 % \n\n≤ 10.6 74 % 25 % 33 % \n\n> 10.6 71 % 52 % 45 % \n\nGenotype 1 \n\n> 600,000 IU/ml \n\nAll 30 % 27 % 29 % \n\n≤ 10.6 27 % 25 % 17 % \n\n> 10.6 37 % 27 % 29 % \n\nGenotype 2/3 All 82 % 80 % 79 % \n\n≤ 10.6 79 % 73 % 50 % \n\n> 10.6 88 % 80 % 80 % \n\nP1.5/R  Ribavirin (800 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg)  \n\nP0.5/R  Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg)  \n\nI/R  Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU)  \n\n \n\nIn a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received peginterferon alfa-2b, 1.5 microgram/kg \n\nsubcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg-1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months \n\n\n\n22 \n\n(based on body weight, only three patients weighing >105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 8). \n\nTwenty-four % had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).  \n\n \n\nTable 8 Virologic Response at End of Treatment, Sustained Virologic Response and Relapse by \n\nHCV Genotype and Viral Load* \n\n  \n\n  \n\nRibavirin 800-1,400 mg/day plus peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μg/kg once \n\nweekly \n\nEnd of treatment \n\nresponse \n\nSustained virologic response Relapse \n\nAll Subjects 94% (211/224) 81% (182/224) 12% (27/224) \n\nHCV 2 100% (42/42) 93% (39/42) 7% (3/42) \n\n≤ 600,000 IU/ml 100% (20/20) 95% (19/20) 5% (1/20) \n\n> 600,000 IU/mL 100% (22/22) 91% (20/22) 9% (2/22) \n\nHCV 3 93% (169/182) 79% (143/182) 14% (24/166) \n\n≤ 600,000 IU/ml 93% (92/99) 86% (85/99) 8% (7/91) \n\n> 600,000 IU/ml 93% (77/83) 70% (58/83) 23% (17/75) \n\n*  Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the follow-up week 12 visit and missing data at the follow-up week \n\n24 visit was considered a sustained responder.

The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%.  \n\nForty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at week 4 and \n\nweek 24 of therapy.   In this subgroup, there was a 92% (89/97) sustained virological response rate.  \n\nThe high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis \n\n(n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).  \n\nLimited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher \n\nsustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following \n\n24 weeks of treatment).  \n\n \n\nA large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b/ ribavirin regimens [peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 µg/kg and 1 µg/kg subcutaneously \n\nonce weekly both in combination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and \n\npeginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily \n\n(in two divided doses) in 3,070 treatment-naïve adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Response \n\nto the treatment was measured by Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) which is defined as \n\nundetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (see Table 9). \n\n \n\nTable 9  Virologic response at treatment week 12, end of treatment response, relapse rate* and \n\nSustained Virologic Response (SVR) \n\n \n\nTreatment group % (number) of patients \n\n \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b \n\n1.5 µg/kg  \n\n+ Ribavirin  \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b  \n\n1 µg/kg  \n\n+ Ribavirin \n\npeginterferon alfa-2a \n\n180 µg \n\n+ Ribavirin  \n\nUndetectable HCV-RNA \n\nat treatment week 12 \n40 (407/1,019) 36 (366/1,016) 45 (466/1,035) \n\nEnd of treatment \n\nresponse* \n53 (542/1,019) 49 (500/1,016) 64 (667/1,035) \n\nRelapse* 24 (123/523) 20 (95/475) 32 (193/612) \n\n\n\n23 \n\nSVR* 40 (406/1,019) 38 (386/1,016) 41 (423/1,035) \n\nSVR in patients with \n\nundetectable HCV-RNA \n\nat treatment week 12 \n\n81 (328/407) 83 (303/366) 74 (344/466) \n\n *HCV-RNA PCR assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 IU/ml \n\nLack of early virologic response by treatment week 12 (detectable HCV-RNA with a < 2 log10 reduction from \n\nbaseline) was a criterion for discontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\nIn all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. In patients of African \n\nAmerican origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for HCV eradication), treatment with \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg)/ ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained \n\nvirologic response rate compared to peginterferon alfa-2b 1 µg/kg dose. At the peginterferon alfa-2b \n\n1.5 µg/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained virologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, \n\nin patients with normal ALT levels, in patients with a baseline viral load > 600,000 IU/ml and in \n\npatients > 40 years old. Caucasian patients had a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to \n\nthe African Americans. Among patients with undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment, the \n\nrelapse rate was 24 %.  \n \n\nPredictability of sustained virological response in naïve patients \n\nVirological response by week 12 is defined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels \n\nof HCV-RNA.Virological response by week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or \n\nundetectable levels of HCV-RNA.

In this \n\nsubgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate.  For patients with prior \n\nfailure on therapy with non-pegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the \n\nsustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively.  Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral \n\nreduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy.  In those patients \n\nthe SVR was 12 %.  \n\n \n\nNon-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a \n\nweek 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to non-pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin \n\n(12.4% vs. 28.6%).  However, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR \n\nregardless of prior treatment or prior response. \n\n \n\n- Retreatment of relapse patients with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment \n\nTwo trials examined the use of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment in relapse \n\npatients (C95-144 and I95-145); 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had relapsed after previous \n\n\n\n27 \n\ninterferon treatment were treated for six months with a six month follow-up.  Combination therapy \n\nwith ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b resulted in a sustained virological response that was ten-fold \n\nhigher than that with interferon alfa-2b alone (49% vs 5 %, p < 0.0001).  This benefit was maintained \n\nirrespective of standard predictors of response to interferon alfa-2b such as virus level, HCV genotype \n\nand histological staging.  \n\n \n\nLong-term efficacy data - Adults \n\nTwo large long-term follow-up studies enrolled 1,071 patients and 567 patients after treatment in prior \n\nstudies with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) and pegylated interferon alfa-\n\n2b (with or without ribavirin), respectively.  The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the durability \n\nof sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical \n\noutcomes. At least 5 years of long-term follow-up was completed after treatment in 462 patients and \n\n327 patients, respectively.  Twelve out of 492 sustained responders and only 3 out of 366 sustained \n\nresponders relapsed, respectively, in the studies.  \n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 97 % (95 % CI: 95-99 %) \n\nfor patients receiving non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin), and is 99 % (95 % \n\nCI: 98-100 %) for patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin).  \n\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and non-pegylated, with or \n\nwithout ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic \n\ninfection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV.  However, this does not preclude the occurrence of \n\nhepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nRibavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-\n\nRNA were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus pegylated \n\ninterferon alfa-2b 60 µg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral \n\nload. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % \n\n< 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate hepatitis \n\nC. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for \n\nundesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2b \n\nneeds to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). The study results are \n\nsummarized in Table 13. \n\n \n\nTable 13 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \n\nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration – All subjects \n\nn = 107 \n\n 24 weeks 48 weeks \n\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %) \n\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %) \n\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) - \n\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %) \n\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %) \n\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of \ndetection = 125 IU/ml. \n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration. \n\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while \n\nthose with genotype 3 and high viral load (≥ 600,000 IU/ml) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \n\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \n\nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \n\n\n\n28 \n\ntwo multicentre trials and received ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 \n\ntimes a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after treatment.  A total of 118 patients were \n\nenrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1, 64 % ≤ 12 years of age.  The population \n\nenrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials, \n\nsustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults.  Due to \n\nthe lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and \n\nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon \n\nalfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).

Of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. The \n\npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and \n\nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \n\nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin \n\ntreatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of sustained \n\nresponders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR relapsed during the 5 years of \n\nfollow-up. \n\n \n\nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \n\nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \n\npatients after treatment in two previously mentioned multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \n\nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \n\nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \n\nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \n\nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \n\none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \n\nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \n\ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \n\ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \n\nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. \n\n \n\nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \n\nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \n\nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \n\ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nAbsorption \n\nRibavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose (mean Tmax= 1.5 hours), \n\nfollowed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases (single dose half-lives of absorption, \n\ndistribution and elimination are 0.05, 3.73 and 79 hours, respectively).  Absorption is extensive with \n\napproximately 10% of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces.   However, absolute bioavailability \n\nis approximately 45%-65%, which appears to be due to first pass metabolism.  There is a linear \n\nrelationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200-1,200 mg ribavirin.  Volume of \n\ndistribution is approximately 5,000 l.  Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nRibavirin transport in non-plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells, and \n\nhas been identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter.  This type of \n\ntransporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of \n\nribavirin.  The ratio of whole blood:plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1; the excess \n\nof ribavirin in whole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nRibavirin has two pathways of metabolism: 1) a reversible phosphorylation pathway; 2) a degradative \n\npathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxyacid metabolite.  \n\nBoth ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are also excreted \n\nrenally.  \n\n \n\nRibavirin has been shown to produce high inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability \n\nfollowing single oral doses (intrasubject variability of approximately 30% for both AUC and Cmax), \n\nwhich may be due to extensive first pass metabolism and transfer within and beyond the blood \n\ncompartment.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nUpon multiple dosing, ribavirin accumulates extensively in plasma with a six-fold ratio of multiple-\n\ndose to single-dose AUC12hr.  Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID, steady-state was reached by \n\napproximately four weeks, with mean steady state plasma concentrations approximately 2,200 ng/ml.  \n\nUpon discontinuation of dosing the half-life was approximately 298 hours, which probably reflects \n\nslow elimination from non-plasma compartments.  \n\n \n\nTransfer into seminal fluid \n\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \n\napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \n\npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \n\nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nThe bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by co-administration of a high fat \n\nmeal (AUCtf and Cmax both increased by 70%).  It is possible that the increased bioavailability in this \n\nstudy was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH.  The clinical relevance of results from \n\nthis single dose study is unknown.  In the pivotal clinical efficacy trial, patients were instructed to take \n\nribavirin with food to achieve the maximal plasma concentration of ribavirin.  \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\nBased on published data, single-dose ribavirin pharmacokinetics was altered (increased AUCtf and \n\nCmax) in patients with renal dysfunction compared with control subjects (creatinine clearance \n\n>90 ml/minute).  The mean AUCtf was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance between \n\n10 and 30 mL/min compared with control subjects. In subjects with creatinine clearance between 30 \n\nand 50 mL/min, AUCtf was twofold greater compared with control subjects. This appears to be due to \n\nreduction of apparent clearance in these patients. Ribavirin concentrations are essentially unchanged \n\nby haemodialysis.    \n\n \n\nHepatic function \n\n\n\n30 \n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \n\ndysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification A, B or C) is similar to those of normal controls.  \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) \n\nSpecific pharmacokinetic evaluations for elderly subjects have not been performed.  However, in a \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic study, age was not a key factor in the kinetics of ribavirin; renal function \n\nis the determining factor.  \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using sparsely sampled serum concentration \n\nvalues from four controlled clinical trials.  The clearance model developed showed that body weight, \n\ngender, age, and serum creatinine were the main covariates.  For males, clearance was approximately \n\n20 % higher than for females.  Clearance increased as a function of body weight and was reduced at \n\nages greater than 40 years.  Effects of these covariates on ribavirin clearance appear to be of limited \n\nclinical significance due to the substantial residual variability not accounted for by the model.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nRibavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \n\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C have been evaluated during a clinical study. In children \n\nand adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of peginterferon alfa-2b at \n\n60 µg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted \n\nto be 58 % (90 % CI: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 µg/kg/week. The \n\npharmacokinetics of ribavirin (dose-normalized) in this trial was similar to those reported in a prior \n\nstudy of ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b in children and adolescent patients and in \n\nadult patients. \n\n \n\nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \n\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b in children and \n\nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 15. The \n\npharmacokinetics of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) is similar in adults and children \n\nor adolescents. \n\n \n\nTable 15  Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for interferon alfa-2b and \n\nribavirin when administered to paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C \n\nParameter Ribavirin  \n\n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided doses \n\n(n = 17) \n\nInterferon alfa-2b \n\n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week \n\n(n = 54) \n\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36) \n\nCmax (ng/ml) 3,275 (25) 51 (48) \n\nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48) \n\nApparent clearance l/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done \n\n*AUC12 (ng.hr/ml) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/ml) for interferon alfa-2b \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRibavirin \n\nRibavirin is embryotoxic or teratogenic, or both, at doses well below the recommended human dose in \n\nall animal species in which studies have been conducted.  Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, \n\nlimbs, skeleton and gastrointestinal tract were noted.  The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects \n\nincreased with escalation of the dose.  Survival of foetuses and offspring was reduced.  \n\n \n\nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups dosed from postnatal day 7 to 63 with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of \n\nribavirin demonstrated a dose-related decrease in overall growth, which was subsequently manifested \n\nas slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length and bone length.  At the end of the recovery \n\nperiod, tibial and femoral changes were minimal although generally statistically significant compared \n\nto controls in males at all dose levels and in females dosed with the two highest doses compared to \n\n\n\n31 \n\ncontrols.  No histopathological effects on bone were observed.  No ribavirin effects were observed \n\nregarding neurobehavioural or reproductive development.  Plasma concentrations achieved in rat pups \n\nwere below human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose.  \n\n \n\nErythrocytes are a primary target of toxicity for ribavirin in animal studies.  Anaemia occurs shortly \n\nafter initiation of dosing, but is rapidly reversible upon cessation of treatment.  \n\n \n\nIn 3- and 6-month studies in mice to investigate ribavirin-induced testicular and sperm effects, \n\nabnormalities in sperm, occurred at doses of 15 mg/kg and above.  These doses in animals produce \n\nsystemic exposures well below those achieved in humans at therapeutic doses.  Upon cessation of \n\ntreatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity occurred within one or \n\ntwo spermatogenic cycles (see section 4.6).  \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies have demonstrated that ribavirin does exert some genotoxic activity.  Ribavirin \n\nwas active in the Balb/3T3 in vitro Transformation Assay.  Genotoxic activity was observed in the \n\nmouse lymphoma assay, and at doses of 20-200 mg/kg in a mouse micronucleus assay.  A dominant \n\nlethal assay in rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted \n\nthrough male gametes.  \n\n \n\nConventional carcinogenicity rodent studies with low exposures compared to human exposure under \n\ntherapeutic conditions (factor 0.1 in rats and 1 in mice) did not reveal tumorigenicity of ribavirin.  In \n\naddition, in a 26 week carcinogenicity study using the heterozygous p53(+/-) mouse model, ribavirin \n\ndid not produce tumours at the maximally tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg (plasma exposure factor \n\napproximately 2.5 compared to human exposure).  These studies suggest that a carcinogenic potential \n\nof ribavirin in humans is unlikely.  \n\n \n\nRibavirin plus interferon \n\nWhen used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, ribavirin did not cause any \n\neffects not previously seen with either active substance alone.  The major treatment-related change \n\nwas a reversible mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by \n\neither active substance alone. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan 200 mg hard capsules \n\nribavirin \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness  are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n\n1. What Ribavirin Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Ribavirin Mylan \n\n3. How to take Ribavirin Mylan \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Ribavirin Mylan \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Ribavirin Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nRibavirin Mylan contains the active substance ribavirin.  This medicine stops the multiplication of \n\nhepatitis C virus. Ribavirin Mylan must not be used without interferon alfa-2b, i.e. Ribavirin Mylan \n\nmust not be used alone. \n\n \n\nDepending on the genotype of the hepatitis C virus that you have, your doctor may choose to treat you \n\nwith a combination of  this medicine with other medicines. There may be some further treatment \n\nlimitations if you have or have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C infection. Your \n\ndoctor will recommend the best course of therapy.  \n\n \n\nThe combination of Ribavirin Mylan and other medicines is used to treat adult patients who have \n\nchronic hepatitis C (HCV). \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated patients: \n\nThe combination of Ribavirin Mylan with interferon alfa-2b is used in paedriatic patientes (children \n\n3 years of age and older) who have chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection.  \n\nFor paediatric patients (children and adolescents) weighing less than 47 kg a solution formulation is \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nPreviously treated adult patients: \n\nThe combination of Ribavirin Mylan with interferon alfa-2b is used to treat adult patients with chronic \n\nhepatitis C, who have previously responded to treatment with an alpha interferon alone, but whose \n\ncondition has recurred. \n\n \n\nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of Ribavirin Mylan with pegylated or other forms of \n\ninterferon (i.e., not alfa-2b). \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Ribavirin Mylan  \n \n\nDo not take Ribavirin Mylan \n\nDo not take Ribavirin Mylan if any of the following apply to you or the child you are caring for. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ribavirin Mylan. \n\n-  are allergic to ribavirin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n-  are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). \n\n-  are breast-feeding. \n\n-  had a serious heart problem during the past 6 months. \n\n-  have any blood disorders, such as anaemia (low blood count), thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia. \n\n \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents must not take combination therapy with Ribavirin Mylan and alpha \n\ninterferon when there is existence or history of serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe \n\ndepression, thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n\n \n\nReminder: Please read the “Do not take” section of the Package Leaflet for interferon alfa-2b before \n\nyou begin used in combination with this medicine. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ribavirin Mylan. \n\n \n\nThere are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of ribavirin with \n\n(peg)interferon alfa. These include: \n\n• Psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal thoughts, attempted \n\nsuicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.). Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you \n\nare becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want \n\nto consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression \n\nor changes in your behaviour \n\n• Severe eye disorders \n\n• Dental and periodontal disorders: Dental and gum disorders have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving ribavirin in combination with (peg)interferon alfa-2b. You should brush your teeth \n\nthoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may \n\nexperience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \n\nafterwards \n\n• Inability to achieve full adult height may occur in some children and adolescents \n\n• Increased hormone related to your thyroid (TSH) in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIf you are caring for a child and your doctor decides not to defer combination treatment with \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b until adulthood, it is important to understand that this \n\ncombination therapy induces a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients.  \n\n \n\nIn addition these events have occurred in patients taking Ribavirin Mylan: \n\nHaemolysis: Ribavirin Mylan can cause a break down in red blood cells causing anaemia which may \n\nimpair your heart function or worsen symptoms of heart disease. \n\nPancytopenia: Ribavirin Mylan can cause a decrease in your platelet and red and white blood cell \n\ncount when used in combination with peginterferon. \n\n  \n\nStandard blood tests will be taken to check your blood, kidney and liver function. \n\n- Blood tests will be done regularly to help your doctor to know if this treatment is working. \n\n- Depending upon the results of these tests, your doctor may change/adjust the number of hard \n\ncapsules you or the child you are caring for take, prescribe a different pack size of this medicine, \n\nand/or change the length of time to take this treatment. \n\n- If you have or develop severe kidney or liver problems, this treatment will be stopped. \n\n \n\nSeek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as \n\ndifficulty in breathing, wheezing or hives) while taking this treatment.  \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor if you or the child you are caring for: \n\n• are a woman of childbearing age (see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). \n\n• are a male and your female partner is of childbearing age (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding”) \n\n• had a previous heart condition or have heart disease. \n\n• have another liver problem in addition to hepatitis C infection.  \n\n• have problems with your kidneys. \n\n• have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or have ever had any other problems with your \nimmune system. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to the Package Leaflet of (peg)interferon alfa for more detailed information on these \n\nsafety issues. \n\n \n\nReminder: Please read the “Warnings and precautions” section of the Package Leaflet for interferon \n\nalfa-2b before you begin combination treatment. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nIf the child is weighing less than 47 kg or unable to swallow an oral solution of Ribavirin is available. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Ribavirin Mylan \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for are taking, have recently taken or \n\nmight take any other medicines: \n\n \n\n- azathioprine is a medicine that suppresses your immune system, using this medicine in \n\ncombination with ribavirin and pegylated alpha interferons and, therefore may increase your \n\nrisk of developing severe blood disorders. \n\n- anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) medicines – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NRTI), and/or  combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART)]: \n\n-  Taking this medicine in combination with an alpha interferon and an anti-HIV medicine \n\nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities \n\ndevelopment (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white \n\nblood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets). \n\n- With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if this medicine will change the way these \n\nmedicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the HIV \n\ninfection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not \n\nyour Ribavirin Mylan treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients receiving \n\nzidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons could be at increased \n\nrisk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).  Therefore the use of \n\nzidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons is not recommended. \n\n- Due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis, \n\nthe use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of ribavirin and \n\nstavudine should be avoided. \n\n- Co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving cART may be at increased risk \n\nof worsening liver function. Adding treatment with an alpha interferon alone or in \n\ncombination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\n \n\nReminder: Please read the “Other medicines” section of the Package Leaflet for interferon alfa-2b \n\nbefore you begin combination treatment with this medicine. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, you must not take this medicine. This medicine can be very damaging to your \n\nunborn baby (embryo). \n\n \n\nBoth female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \n\npossibility for pregnancy to occur: \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n• Girl or woman of childbearing age: \nYou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and \n\nfor the 4 months after treatment is stopped. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n\n• Men:  \nDo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the \n\npossibility for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body.  \n\nIf your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for \n\npregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. You \n\nor your female partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking \n\nribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with your doctor \n\n(see section “Do not take Ribavirin Mylan”). \n\n \n\nIf you are a woman who is breast-feeding, you must not take this medicine. Discontinue breast-\n\nfeeding before starting to take this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive or use machines; however, interferon alfa-2b may \n\naffect your ability to drive or use machines. Therefore, do not drive or use machines if you become \n\ntired, sleepy, or confused from this treatment. \n\n \n\nRibavirin Mylan contains lactose  \n\nEach Ribavirin Mylan hard capsule contains a small amount of lactose.  If you have been told by your \n\ndoctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, discuss with your doctor before taking this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Ribavirin Mylan \n \n\nGeneral information about taking this medicine: \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\nDo not take more than the recommended dosage and take the medicine for as long as prescribed.  \n\nYour doctor has determined the correct dose of Ribavirin Mylan based on how much you or the child \n\nyou are caring for weighs. \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose and duration of Ribavirin Mylan depends on how much the patient weighs and \n\nthe medicines that are used in combination. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nDosing for children above 3 years of age and adolescents depends on how much the person weighs and \n\nthe medicines that are used in combination.
