NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNeofordex 40 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains dexamethasone acetate, equivalent to 40 mg dexamethasone. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 98.1 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \nWhite, oblong (11 mm × 5.5 mm) tablet with a score-line on one face. \nThe tablet can be divided for administration of a 20 mg dose (see section 4.2). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNeofordex is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic multiple myeloma in combination with \nother medicinal products. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of multiple myeloma. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose and administration frequency varies with the therapeutic protocol and the associated treatment(s). \nNeofordex administration should follow instructions for dexamethasone administration when described in \nthe Summary of Product Characteristics of the associated treatment(s). If this is not the case, local or \ninternational treatment protocols and guidelines should be followed. Prescribing physicians should carefully \nevaluate which dose of dexamethasone to use, taking into account the condition and disease status of the \npatient. \n \nThe usual posology of dexamethasone is 40 mg once per day of administration. \n \nAt the end of dexamethasone treatment, the dose should be tapered in a stepwise fashion until a complete \nstop. \n \nElderly  \nIn elderly and/or frail patients, the daily dose may be reduced to 20 mg of dexamethasone, according to the \nappropriate treatment regimen. \n \nHepatic impairment or renal insufficiency  \nPatients with hepatic impairment or renal insufficiency require appropriate monitoring; patients with hepatic \nimpairment should be dosed with caution as there are no data for this patient population (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Neofordex in the paediatric population in the indication multiple myeloma. \n \nMethod of administration  \nOral use.  \n \nIn order to minimise insomnia, the tablet should preferably be taken in the morning. \n \nTablets should be kept in the blister package until administration. Individual tablets in intact packaging \nshould be separated from the blister using the perforation, e.g. for use in multi-compartment compliance aids. \n \nTablets may be broken in two equal halves using the score line to provide the 20 mg dose. Due to possible \nstability issues affecting half tablets stored after division, half-tablets that are not taken immediately \nshould be discarded in agreement with local precautions for environmental protection (see also 6.4).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive viral disease (especially viral hepatitis, herpes, varicella, shingles). \n \nUncontrolled psychoses. \n \nWhen Neofordex is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their Summaries of Product \nCharacteristics for additional contraindications. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeofordex is a high-dose glucocorticoid. This should be taken into consideration in the surveillance of the \npatient. The benefit from dexamethasone treatment should be carefully and continuously weighed against \nactual and potential risks. \n \nRisk of infection \nTreatment with high-dose dexamethasone increases the risk of developing serious infections, in particular \ndue to bacteria, yeasts and/or parasites. Such infections can also be caused by microorganisms that rarely \ncause disease under normal circumstances (opportunistic infections). Signs of a developing infection may be \nmasked by dexamethasone therapy.  \n \nBefore the start of treatment, any source of infection, especially tuberculosis, should be removed. During \ntreatment, patients should be closely monitored for the appearance of infections. In particular, pneumonia \noccurs commonly. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of pneumonia and be advised to \nseek medical attention in case of their appearance. In case of active infectious disease, appropriate anti-\ninfective treatment must be added to the treatment with Neofordex. \n \nIn cases of prior tuberculosis with major radiological sequelae or if it is not certain that a full 6-month \nrifampicin treatment course has been followed, a prophylactic anti-tuberculosis treatment is required. \n \nThere is a risk of severe strongyloidiasis. Patients from endemic areas (tropical and sub-tropical regions, \nsouthern Europe) should have a stool examination and if required an eradication of the parasite before \ninitiating dexamethasone treatment. \n \nCertain viral diseases (varicella, measles) can be aggravated in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment or \nwho have received glucocorticoid treatment within the previous 3 months. Patients must avoid contact with \nsubjects with chickenpox or measles. Immunocompromised patients who have not previously had \nchickenpox or measles are particularly at risk. If such patients have been in contact with people with \nchickenpox or measles, a preventive treatment with intravenous normal immunoglobulin or passive \n\n\n\n4 \n\nimmunisation with varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be started as appropriate. Exposed patients \nshould be advised to seek medical attention without delay. \n \nNeofordex should not be used with live attenuated vaccines (see section 4.5). Vaccinations with inactivated \nvaccines are usually possible. However, the immune response and hence the effect of the vaccination can be \ndiminished by high glucocorticoid doses. \n \nDexamethasone can suppress skin reaction to allergy testing. It can also affect the nitro blue tetrazolium \n(NBT) test for bacterial infections and cause false-negative results.   \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nPatients and/or carers should be warned that potentially severe psychiatric adverse reactions may occur with \nsystemic steroids (see section 4.8). Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of starting the \ntreatment. Risks may be higher with high doses (see also section 4.5 for pharmacokinetic interactions that \ncan increase the risk of adverse reactions), although dose levels do not allow prediction of the onset, type \nseverity or duration of reactions. Most reactions recover after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although \nspecific treatment may be necessary. Patients/carers should be encouraged to seek medical advice if \nworrying psychological symptoms develop, especially if depressed mood or suicidal ideation is suspected. \nPatients/carers should also be alert to possible psychiatric disturbances that may occur either during, or \nimmediately after, dose tapering/withdrawal of systemic steroids, although such reactions have been reported \ninfrequently.  \n \nParticular care is required when considering the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with existing or \nprevious history of severe affective disorders in themselves or in their first degree relatives. These would \ninclude depressive or manic-depressive illness and previous steroid psychoses.  \n \nInsomnia may be minimised by administering Neofordex in the morning. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nIn post marketing experience tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients with \nhaematological malignancies following the use of dexamethasone alone or in combination with other \nchemotherapeutic agents. Patient at high risk of TLS, such as patients with high proliferative rate, high \ntumour burden, and high sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, should be monitored closely and appropriate \nprecaution taken. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nTreatment for active gastric or duodenal ulceration should be commenced prior to initiation of \ncorticosteroids. Appropriate prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a previous history of, or risk \nfactors for, gastric or duodenal ulceration, haemorrhage or perforation. Patients should be monitored \nclinically, including by endoscopy. \n \nEye disorders \nSystemic treatment with glucocorticoids can induce chorioretinopathy which may result in impaired vision \nincluding loss of vision. \n \nProlonged use of corticosteroids may produce subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the \noptic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. \nParticular care is needed when treating patients with glaucoma (or family history of glaucoma) as well as \nwhen treating patients with ocular herpes simplex, because of possible corneal perforation. \n \nTendonitis  \nCorticosteroids can favour the development of tendonitis and, in exceptional cases, rupture of the affected \ntendon. This risk is increased by concomitant use of fluoroquinolones and in patients undergoing dialysis \nwith secondary hyperparathyroidism or after renal transplantation. \n \nPheochromocytoma crisis  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, has been reported after administration of systemic \ncorticosteroids. Corticosteroids should only be administered to patients with suspected or identified \npheochromocytoma after an appropriate risk/benefit evaluation \n \n \nElderly \nThe common adverse reactions to systemic corticosteroids may be associated with more serious \nconsequences in old age, especially osteoporosis, hypertension, hypokalaemia, diabetes, susceptibility to \ninfection and thinning of the skin. Close clinical supervision is required to avoid life-threatening reactions. \n \nMonitoring \nUse of corticosteroids requires appropriate monitoring in patients with ulcerative colitis (due to perforation \nrisk), recent intestinal anastomoses, diverticulitis, recent myocardial infarction (risk of left ventricular free \nwall rupture), diabetes mellitus (or family history), renal insufficiency, hepatic impairment, osteoporosis and \nmyasthenia gravis. \n \nLong-term treatment \nDuring treatment, a diet low in simple sugars and high in protein should be followed due to the \nhyperglycaemic effect of corticosteroids and their stimulation of protein catabolism with a negative nitrogen \nbalance. \n \nWater and sodium retention is common and can lead to hypertension. Sodium intake should be reduced and \nblood pressure should be monitored. Particular care is needed when treating patients with renal impairment, \nhypertension or congestive heart failure. \n \nPotassium levels should be monitored during treatment. Potassium supplementation should be given \nparticularly if there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmia or concurrent hypokalaemic medicinal products. \n \nGlucocorticoid therapy may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic and antihypertensive treatment. The dose of \ninsulin, oral anti-diabetics and anti-hypertensive medicinal products may have to be increased. \n \nDepending on the duration of treatment, calcium metabolism may be impaired. Calcium and vitamin D levels \nshould be monitored. In patients not already prescribed bisphosphonates for multiple myeloma related bone \ndisease, bisphosphonates should be considered, particularly if risk factors for osteoporosis are present. \n \nLactose intolerance \nNeofordex contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nUse in combination with other multiple myeloma treatment(s) \n \nWhen Neofordex is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment \nwith Neofordex.  \n \nWhen Neofordex is used in combination with known teratogens (e.g. thalidomide, lenalidomide, \npomalidomide, plerixafor), particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is \nneeded (see section 4.6). \n \nVenous and arterial thromboembolic events \nIn patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of dexamethasone with thalidomide and its analogues is \nassociated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and \npulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism (predominantly myocardial infarction and \ncerebrovascular event) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nConsequently, patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (including prior thrombosis) should be \nclosely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, \n\n\n\n6 \n\nhypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic medicinal products may \nalso increase thrombotic risk in these patients. Therefore, erythropoietic medicinal products, or other \nmedicinal products that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, should \nbe used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving dexamethasone with thalidomide and its \nanalogues. A haemoglobin concentration above 12 g/dl should lead to discontinuation of erythropoietic \nmedicinal products. \n \nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, \nchest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic treatment should be recommended, especially in \npatients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take antithrombotic prophylactic measures \nshould be made after careful assessment of an individual patient’s underlying risk factors. \n \nIf the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard \nanticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment and any \ncomplications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the treatment with dexamethasone and \nthalidomide or its analogues may be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit risk assessment. \nThe patient should continue anticoagulation therapy during the course of treatment with dexamethasone and \nthalidomide or its analogues.  \n \nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \nThe combination of dexamethasone with lenalidomide in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a \nhigher incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared \nwith 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes \nwere observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0% in \nplacebo/dexamethasone treated patients; see section 4.8). Neutropenia was the most frequently reported \nGrade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reaction in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated \nwith the combination of dexamethasone with pomalidomide. Patients should be monitored for \nhaematological adverse reactions, especially neutropenia. Patients should be advised to promptly report \nfebrile episodes. A dose reduction of lenalidomide or pomalidomide may be required. In case of neutropenia, \nthe physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management. \n \nThe combination of dexamethasone with lenalidomide in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a \nhigher incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated \npatients) (see section 4.8). Thrombocytopenia was also reported very commonly by patients with \nrelapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated with the combination of dexamethasone with pomalidomide. \nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae \nand epistaxes, especially in case of concomitant treatment susceptible to induce bleeding. A dose reduction \nof lenalidomide or pomalidomide may be required. \n \nA complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count, \nhaemoglobin, and haematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of \ndexamethasone/lenalidomide treatment and monthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPrior to the use of Neofordex in combination with any other medicinal product, reference should be \nmade to the Summary of Product Characteristics of that product. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nThe following combinations should be avoided due to safety concerns: \n\n• With acetylsalicylic acid, at doses ≥ 1 g per dose or 3 g per day, due to an increased risk of bleeding. \nAt doses ≥ 500 mg per dose or < 3 g per day, precautions are required due to increased risk of \n\n\n\n7 \n\nhaemorrhage, ulcerations and gastro-intestinal perforation. However, antithrombotic prophylaxis \nwith low-dose acetylsalicylic acid is possible. \n\n• With live attenuated vaccines, due to risk of vaccine-related illness with risk of death. \n \nThe following combinations require precautions due to safety concerns: \n\n• With hypokalaemic medicinal products: hypokalemic diuretics, single or in combination, laxatives, \ntetracosactide, intravenous amphotericin B, due to increased risk of hypokalaemia. Potassium levels \nshould be monitored and corrected as necessary. In addition, amphotericin B carries a risk of cardiac \nenlargement and cardiac failure with concurrent use. \n\n• With digitalis, as hypokalaemia enhances the toxic effects of digitalis. Any hypokalaemia should be \ncorrected and patients should be monitored clinically, for electrolytes and by electrocardiograpy. \n\n• With medicinal products that carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes, due to increased risk of ventricular \narrhythmia. Any hypokalaemia should be corrected and patients should be monitored clinically, for \nelectrolytes and by electrocardiography. \n\n• With erythropoietic medicinal products or other medicinal products that may increase the risk of \nthrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, in patients receiving thalidomide or its analogues \nwith Neofordex (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n• With non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), due to an increased risk of gastrointestinal \nulceration. \n\n• With hypoglycaemic medicinal products, as dexamethasone can raise glycaemic levels and diminish \nglucose tolerance, with a possibility of ketoacidosis. Patients should be made aware of this risk and \nself-monitoring of blood and urine should be reinforced, especially during the initiation of treatment. \nThe posology of anti-diabetic medicinal products may have to be adjusted during and after the \ntreatment with dexamethasone. \n\n• With anti-hypertensive medicinal products, due to a reduction of their effect (water and sodium \nretention). The dose of the anti-hypertensive treatment may have to be adjusted during the treatment \nwith dexamethasone. \n\n• With fluoroquinolones, due to possibly increased risk of tendonitis and, in exceptional cases, rupture \nof the affected tendon, particularly after long-term treatment. \n\n• With methotrexate, due to an increased risk of haematological toxicity. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on dexamethasone \nDexamethasone is metabolized via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and transported by the P-glycoprotein \n(P-gp, also known as MDR1). Concomitant administration of dexamethasone with inducers or inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 or P-gp may lead to decreased or increased plasma concentrations of dexamethasone, respectively. \n \nThe following combinations require precautions due to changes in dexamethasone pharmacokinetics: \n− Medicinal products that may reduce dexamethasone plasma concentration: \n\n• Aminogluthetimide, due to a reduction of the efficacy of dexamethasone through an increase of its \nhepatic metabolism.  \n\n• Anticonvulsants that are hepatic enzyme inducers: carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, primidone, due to the reduction of dexamethasone plasma levels and hence its efficacy.  \n\n• With rifampicin, due to reduction of dexamethasone plasma concentrations and efficacy by an \nincrease of its hepatic metabolism.  \n\n• Topical gastro-intestinal medicinal products, antacids and activated carbon, as well as colestyramine, \ndue to reduction of the intestinal absorption of dexamethasone. The administration of such medicinal \nproducts and Neofordex should be separated by at least two hours. \n\n• Ephedrine, due to a reduction in dexamethasone plasma levels by increased metabolic clearance. \n− Medicinal products that may increase dexamethasone plasma concentration: \n\n• Aprepitant and fosaprepitant, due to an increase of dexamethasone plasma concentrations by a \nreduction of its hepatic metabolism.  \n\n• Clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, \nvoriconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir: Increased dexamethasone plasma concentration due to reduction \nof its hepatic metabolism by these enzyme inhibitors. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nEffects of dexamethasone on other medicinal products \nDexamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and of P-gp. Concomitant administration of \ndexamethasone with substances that are metabolised via CYP3A4 or transported by P-gp could lead to \nincreased clearance and decreased plasma concentrations of these substances:  \n \n\n• Oral contraceptives, as it cannot be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced \nduring treatment. No interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Effective \nmeasures to avoid pregnancy must be taken (see section 4.6). Efficacy of hormone replacement \ntherapy may also be reduced. \n\n• Oral anticoagulants, due to a possible impact of corticosteroids on the metabolism of the oral \nanticoagulant and on coagulation factors, as well as the haemorrhagic risk (mucosa of the digestive \ntract, vascular fragility) of dexamethasone therapy itself at high doses or treatment periods above \n10 days. It the combination is required, monitoring should be reinforced and coagulation parameters \ncontrolled after one week and then every other week of treatment as well as after the end of \ntreatment. \n\n• Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, due to reduction of their plasma levels by induction of CYP3A \nand P-gp.  \n\n• Lapatinib, due to increased hepatotoxicity of lapatinib likely due to induction of CYP3A4 \nmetabolism. \n\n• Ciclosporin, due to a reduction of ciclosporin bioavailability and plasma levels. Ciclosporin may also \nincrease the intracellular uptake of dexamethasone. In addition, convulsions have been reported with \nconcurrent use of dexamethasone and ciclosporin. Concomitant use of dexamethasone and \nciclosporine should be avoided. \n\n• Midazolam, due a reduction in midazolam plasma levels by CYP3A4 induction. The efficacy of \nmidazolam may be reduced. \n\n• Ivermectin, due to a reduction of ivermectin plasma levels. Parasite eradication must be successfully \nterminated before dexamethasone use (see section 4.4). \n\n• Rifabutin, due to reduced rifabutin plasma levels by induction of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4.  \n• Indinavir, due to a strong reduction of indinavir plasma levels by intestinal CYP3A4 induction. \n• Erythromycin, due to increased metabolism of erythromycin in non-carriers of the CYP3A5*1 allele \n\nafter dexamethasone treatment. \n• Isoniazid, as glucocorticoids may decrease isoniazid plasma concentrations, probably due to a \n\nstimulation of hepatic metabolism of isoniazid and a reduction of glucocorticoid metabolism. \n• Praziquantel, due to the reduction of praziquantel plasma concentrations due to an increase of its \n\nhepatic metabolism by dexamethasone, with a risk of failure of treatment. The treatments with the \ntwo medicinal products should be separated by at least one week. \n\n \nRepeated, daily administration of dexamethasone also leads to reduced dexamethasone plasma levels due to \nthe induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp. No dose adjustment is needed in the treatment of multiple myeloma. \n \nDexamethasone has no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with thalidomide, lenalidomide, \npomalidomide, bortezomib, vincristine or doxorubicin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen should avoid pregnancy during Neofordex treatment. Dexamethasone may cause congenital \nmalformations (see section 5.3). Dexamethasone may be used with known teratogens (e.g. thalidomide, \nlenalidomide, pomalidomide, plerixafor), or with cytotoxic substances which are contraindicated in \npregnancy. Patients receiving Neofordex in combination with products containing thalidomide, lenalidomide \nor pomalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention programmes of those products. Reference \nshould be made to all the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics prior to the commencement of any \ncombination treatment for additional information.  \n \nContraception in males and females \n\n\n\n9 \n\nWomen of childbearing potential and their male partners should take appropriate contraceptive measures. In \nparticular, the requirements of the pregnancy prevention programme for combination treatment with \nthalidomide or its analogues must be followed. The efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during \ndexamethasone treatment (see section 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \nBased on human experience, dexamethasone is suggested to cause congenital malformations, particularly \nintra-uterine growth retardation and rarely neonatal adrenal insufficiency, when administered during \npregnancy.  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nNeofordex should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with dexamethasone. \n \nBreast-feeding \nGlucocorticoids are excreted in human milk and effects have been shown in breastfed newborns/infants of \ntreated women. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Neofordex \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \nStudies in animals have shown reductions in female fertility (see Section 5.3). No data on male fertility are \navailable. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNeofordex has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nDexamethasone may cause confusional state, hallucinations, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, syncope and \nblurred vision (see section 4.8). If affected, patients should be instructed not to drive, use machines or \nperform hazardous tasks while being treated with dexamethasone.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nAdverse reactions to Neofordex correspond to the predictable safety profile of glucocorticoids. \nHyperglycaemia, insomnia, muscle pain and weakness, asthenia, fatigue, oedema and weight increase occur \nvery commonly. Less common but serious adverse reactions include: pneumonia and other infections and \npsychiatric disorders (see section 4.4). In combination with thalidomide or its analogues the most serious \nadverse reactions were venous thromboembolic events, predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary \nembolism, and myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence of predictable adverse reactions, including adrenal atrophy, correlates with dose, timing of \nadministration and the duration of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions observed in patients treated with dexamethasone are listed below by system organ \nclass and frequency. Data are derived from historical experience and clinical studies in multiple myeloma \npatients in which dexamethasone was used as monotherapy or in combination with placebo. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000 including isolated reports), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \n\nSystem organ class  Adverse reactions \n\n\n\n10 \n\nInfections and Infestations Common: Pneumonia, herpes zoster, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, lower respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, oral \nfungal infection, urinary tract infection, herpes simplex, candidal \ninfection; \nNot known: Infection, sepsis. \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon: Neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, \nleukopenia, leukocytosis; \nUncommon: Febrile neutropenia, pancytopenia, coagulopathy. \n\nEndocrine disorders Common: Cushing’s syndrome; \nUncommon: Hypothyroidism; \nNot known: Adrenal atrophy, steroid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal \ninsufficiency, hirsutism, menstrual irregularity.  \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common: Hyperglycaemia; \nCommon: Hypokalaemia, diabetes mellitus, anorexia, increased or \ndecreased appetite, hypoalbuminaemia, fluid retention, \nhyperuricaemia; \nUncommon: Dehydration, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia; \nNot known: Glucose tolerance impaired, sodium retention, \nmetabolic alkalosis. \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very common: Insomnia; \nCommon: Depression, anxiety, aggression, confusional state, \nirritability, nervousness, mood alteration, agitation, euphoric mood; \nUncommon: Mood swings, hallucinations; \nNot known: Mania, psychosis, behavioural disturbance. \n\nNervous system disorders Common: Peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, psychomotor \nhyperactivity, disturbance in attention, memory impairment, \ntremor, paraesthesia, headache, ageusia, dysgeusia, somnolence, \nlethargy, balance impaired, dysphonia; \nUncommon: Cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, \namnesia, coordination abnormal, ataxia, syncope; \nNot known: Convulsions. \n\nEye disorders Common: Vision blurred, cataract; \nUncommon: Conjunctivitis, increased lacrimation; \nNot known: Chorioretinopathy, glaucoma. \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Common: Vertigo. \nCardiac disorders Common: Atrial fibrillation, supraventricular extrasystoles, \n\ntachycardia, palpitations; \nUncommon: Myocardial ischaemia, bradycardia; \nNot known: Congestive heart failure. \n\nVascular disorders Common: Venous thromboembolic reactions, predominantly deep \nvein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, hypertension, \nhypotension, flushing, blood pressure increased, diastolic blood \npressure decreased; \nNot known: Purpura, bruising. \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, or \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: Bronchitis, cough, dyspnoea, pharyngolaryngeal pain, \nhoarseness, hiccough.  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very Common: Constipation; \nCommon: Vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, \ngastritis, abdominal pain, dry mouth, abdominal distension, \nflatulence; \nNot known: Pancreatitis, gastrointestinal perforation, \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulcer. \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common: Liver function tests abnormal, alanine aminotransferase \nincreased. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon: Rash, erythema, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, dry skin, \nalopecia; \nUncommon: Urticaria; \nNot known: Skin atrophy, acne. \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common: Muscular weakness, muscle cramps; \nCommon: Myopathy, musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, pain in \nextremity; \nNot known: Pathological fracture, osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, \ntendon rupture. \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common: Pollakiuria; \nUncommon: Renal failure. \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common: Fatigue, asthenia, oedema (including peripheral and \nfacial oedema); \nCommon: Pain, mucosal inflammation, pyrexia, chills, malaise; \nNot known: Impaired healing. \n\nInvestigations Common: Weight decreased, weight increased. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPrior to the use of Neofordex in combination with any other medicinal product, reference should be \nmade to the Summary of Product Characteristics of that product.  \n \nThe incidence rate of certain adverse reactions varies depending on the combination treatment used.  \n \nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients is \nassociated with a higher incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated \npatients compared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia \nepisodes were observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to \n0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone treated patients). A similar incidence of high-grade neutropenia was \nreported in newly diagnosed patients treated with the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. \n \nNeutropenia occurred in 45.3% of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients who received low dose \ndexamethasone plus pomalidomide (Pom + LD-Dex), and in 19.5% of patients who received high dose \ndexamethasone (HD-Dex). Neutropenia was Grade 3 or 4 in 41.7% of patients who received Pom + LD-Dex, \ncompared with 14.8%  who received HD-Dex. In Pom + LD-Dex treated patients neutropenia was \ninfrequently serious (2.0% of patients), did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and was associated with \ntreatment interruption in 21.0% of patients, and with dose reduction in 7.7% of patients. Febrile neutropenia \n(FN) was experienced in 6.7% of patients who received Pom + LD-Dex, and in no patients who received \nHD-Dex. All were reported to be Grade 3 or 4. FN was reported to be serious in 4.0% of patients. FN was \nassociated with dose interruption in 3.7% of patients, and with dose reduction in 1.3% of patients, and with \nno treatment discontinuations. \n \nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients is \nassociated with a higher incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated \npatients). A similar incidence of high-grade thrombocytopenia was reported in newly diagnosed patients \ntreated with the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 27.0% of \nrelapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients who received Pom + LD-Dex, and 26.8% of patients who \nreceived HD-Dex. Thrombocytopenia was Grade 3 or 4 in 20.7% of patients who received Pom + LD-Dex \nand in 24.2% who received HD-Dex. In Pom + LD-Dex treated patients, thrombocytopenia was serious in \n1.7% of patients, led to dose reduction in 6.3% of patients, to dose interruption in 8% of patients and to \ntreatment discontinuation in 0.7% of patients. \n \nThe combination of lenalidomide, thalidomide or pomalidomide with dexamethasone is associated with an \nincreased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with multiple myeloma (see \n\n\n\n12 \n\nsection 4.5). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic medicinal products or previous history of deep \nvein thrombosis may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. \n \nLow-grade peripheral neuropathic reactions, predominantly grade 1 paraesthesia, may be observed with \ndexamethasone alone in up to 34% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. However, both incidence \nand severity of peripheral neuropathy increase with concomitant bortezomib or thalidomide administration. \nIn one study, 10.7% of patients treated with thalidomide and dexamethasone experienced grade 3/4 \nneuropathic reactions, compared to 0.9% of patients treated with dexamethasone alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute toxicity of dexamethasone is weak and toxic effects have rarely been observed after an acute overdose. \nNo antidote exists and treatment is symptomatic. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use, glucocorticoids, ATC code: H02AB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid; it combines high anti-inflammatory effects with low \nmineralocorticoid activity. At high doses (e.g. 40 mg), it reduces the immune response. \n \nDexamethasone has been shown to induce multiple myeloma cell death (apoptosis) via a down-regulation of \nNuclear Factor-κB activity and an activation of caspase-9 through second mitochondria-derived activator of \ncaspase (Smac; an apoptosis promoting factor) release. Prolonged exposure was required to achieve \nmaximum levels of apoptotic markers along with increased caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. \nDexamethasone also down-regulated anti apoptotic genes and increased IκB-α protein levels.  \n \nDexamethasone apoptotic activity is enhanced by the combination with thalidomide or its analogues and \nwith proteasome inhibitor (e.g. bortezomib).  \n \nMultiple myeloma is a progressive rare haematologic disease. It is characterized by excessive numbers of \nabnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of intact monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG, \nIgA, IgD, or IgE) or Bence-Jones protein only (free immunoglobulin monoclonal κ and λ light chains). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nNo clinical efficacy and safety studies have been conducted using Neofordex in the treatment of multiple \nmyeloma. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of dexamethasone combination treatment in multiple myeloma has been confirmed \nin numerous clinical studies in newly diagnosed patients and in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. \nThe patient populations studied included a wide range of ages, as well as patients considered eligible or \nineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. High-dose (40 mg or 20 mg) oral dexamethasone has been \nstudied in the therapy of multiple myeloma in combination with chemotherapy in the VAD regimen \n(vincristine, adriamycin/doxorubicin and dexamethasone) or in association with novel agents, including \nthalidomide and its analogues as well as proteasome inhibitors. In controlled studies, combination treatment \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nwith dexamethasone consistently showed better outcomes in terms of survival and response than single-agent \ndexamethasone. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Neofordex \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration of Neofordex, dexamethasone peak plasma levels are reached at a median of three \nhours. Bioavailability of dexamethasone is approximately 80%. There is a linear relationship between \nadministered and bioavailable doses.   \nDexamethasone is transported by the P-glycoprotein (also known as MDR1). Other MDR transporters may \nalso have a role in dexamethasone transport. \n \nDistribution \nDexamethasone is bound by plasma proteins, principally albumin, up to about 80%, depending on the \nadministered dose. At very high doses the majority of dexamethasone circulates unbound in the blood. The \nvolume of distribution is approximately 1 l/kg. Dexamethasone crosses the blood-brain barrier and the \nplacental barrier and passes into breast milk. \n \nBiotransformation \nA minor part of administered dexamethasone is excreted unchanged by the kidney. The major part is \nhydrogenated or hydroxylated in humans, the major metabolites being hydroxy-6-dexamethasone and \ndihydro-20-dexamethasone. 30 to 40% are conjugated to glucuronic acid or sulphated in the human liver and \nexcreted in this form in the urine. Dexamethasone is metabolized via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). \nOther cytochrome P450 isoenzymes may also play a role in dexamethasone biotransformation. \n \nElimination \nThe plasma half-life of dexamethasone is approximately 250 minutes.  \n \nSpecific groups of patients \n \nNo data are available on the biotransformation of dexamethasone in hepatically impaired patients. \n \nSmoking has no influence on dexamethasone pharmacokinetics. No differences were found in \ndexamethasone pharmacokinetics between subjects of European and Asian (Indonesian and Japanese) \ndescent. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGlucocorticoids have only weak acute toxicity. No chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity data are available. \nGenotoxicity findings have been shown to be artefactual. In reproductive toxicity studies in mice, rats, \nhamsters, rabbits and dogs, dexamethasone has led to embryo-fetal malformations such as increase in cleft \npalate and skeletal defects; decreases in thymus, spleen and adrenal weight; lung, liver, and kidney \nabnormalities; and inhibition of growth. Post-natal development assessment of animals treated prenatally \npresented decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, behavioural alterations and decrease in brain \nand body weight. In males, fertility may be decreased through germ cell apoptosis and spermatogenic \ndefects. Data on female fertility are contradictory. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Neofordex \n3. How to take Neofordex \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Neofordex \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Neofordex is and what it is used for \n \nNeofordex is a medicine that contains the active substance dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is a type of \nhormone called a glucocorticoid, sometimes called a corticoid or corticosteroid, with various actions \nincluding effects on white blood cells, which form part of the immune system (the body’s natural defences). \nDexamethasone is similar to glucocorticoids which are naturally produced in the body. \n \nNeofordex is used to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood affecting the white \nblood cells that produce antibodies. Neofordex will be given with other medicines for multiple myeloma. \nThey act together by killing cancerous white blood cells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Neofordex \n \nDo not take Neofordex \n− if you are allergic to dexamethasone or one of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6), \n− if you have a viral infection, especially viral hepatitis, herpes, chickenpox or shingles, \n− if you have an untreated psychiatric illness. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTreatment with a high-dose corticosteroid may reduce your body’s ability to fight infection. This can \nsometimes lead to infections caused by germs that rarely cause infection under normal circumstances (called \nopportunistic infections). If you get an infection of any kind during treatment with this medicine, contact \nyour doctor immediately. This is particularly important if you notice signs of pneumonia: cough, fever, \nshortness of breath and chest pain. You may also feel confused, particularly if you are elderly. You should \nalso tell your doctor if you have had tuberculosis or if you have stayed in regions where roundworm \ninfections are common.  \n \nNote: It is important that while you are taking Neofordex you avoid contact with anyone who is suffering \nfrom chickenpox, measles or shingles. If you think you may have had contact with anyone with these \nconditions, you should inform your doctor immediately.  \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nHigh-dose corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, can cause psychological problems that may sometimes \nbe serious. Talk to your doctor before taking Neofordex if you or a member of your immediate family have \nsuffered, or currently suffer from severe depression or manic attacks. This is especially important if you feel \ndepressed or might be thinking about suicide. \n \nYou should tell your doctor if you have symptoms of tumour lysis syndrome such as muscle cramping, \nmuscle weakness, confusion, visual loss or disturbances and shortness of breath \n \nDuring treatment with this medicine it is important to maintain a balanced diet. Your doctor will advise on an \nappropriate diet, and may prescribe potassium, calcium or vitamin D supplements. \n \nIf you have had blood clots in the past you should inform your doctor before taking Neofordex. The \ncombination of dexamethasone with thalidomide, lenalidomide or pomalidomide (medicines to treat multiple \nmyeloma) increases the risk of blood clots in the veins and arteries. You must tell your doctor immediately if \nyou experience shortness of breath, chest pain or swelling in the arms or legs. \n \nThe combination of dexamethasone with lenalidomide or pomalidomide may cause a decrease in normal \nwhite blood cells (blood cells that help fight infection) and/or blood platelets (which help prevent bleeding). \nYour doctor will arrange appropriate blood tests before and during treatment.  \nTreatment with this medicine may cause pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal. Pheochromocytoma \nis a rare tumor of the adrenal glands Crisis can occur with the following symptoms: headaches, sweating, \npalpitations, and hypertension. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of these signs. \n \nTreatment with this medicine may cause central serous chorioretinopathy, an eye disease that leads to blurred \nor distorted vision. This happens usually in one of the eyes. If you notice blurring or distorted vision that \nlasts for several days, please contact your doctor. \n \nTreatment with this medicine may cause tendon inflammation. In extremely rare cases, a tendon may \nrupture. This risk is increased by treatment with certain antibiotics and by kidney problems. Contact your \ndoctor if you notice painful, stiff or swollen joints or tendons. \n \nPlease inform any doctor, dentist or person who may prescribe a treatment for you that you are currently \ntaking or have recently taken dexamethasone.  \n \nIf you become ill or are involved in an accident, or if you need surgery (even at the dentist) or require a \nvaccination (particularly “live virus” vaccines) you should inform the doctor treating you that you are taking \nor have recently taken high-dose corticosteroids. \n \nIf you need tests (in particular for infections) you should inform the person performing the tests as \ndexamethasone may interfere with the results. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Neofordex \n- if you have liver or kidney disease, \n- if you have heart disease or you have recently had a heart attack, \n- if you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or you are a smoker, \n- if you have diabetes or if there is a history of diabetes in your family, \n- if you have osteoporosis, especially if you are a woman who has been through the menopause, \n- if you have glaucoma (increased eye pressure) or if there is a history of glaucoma in your family, \n- if you have myasthenia gravis (a disease affecting the muscles), \n- if you have a peptic ulcer (ulcer in your stomach or duodenum), or a history of peptic ulcers, stomach \n\nbleeding or perforation, \n- if you have inflammation of the colon, diverticulitis, or have recently had surgery on the intestine, \n- if you have inflammation of a tendon, \n- If you have or are suspected of having pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal glands). \n\n \nYou doctor will observe you more closely if you have any of the listed diseases. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIf you are elderly, some of the side effects of Neofordex may be more serious, especially thinning of the \nbones (osteoporosis), high blood pressure, low potassium levels, diabetes, susceptibility to infection and \nthinning of the skin. Your doctor will monitor you more closely. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nChildren do not develop multiple myeloma. This medicine should not be given to children (i.e. anyone below \nthe age of 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Neofordex \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with Neofordex for \ninformation related to these medicines before starting treatment with Neofordex. When thalidomide, \nlenalidomide or pomalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements \nis needed. \n \nIf you are taking any of the following medicines, you should consult your doctor before taking Neofordex: \n- Anticoagulant medicines (which thin the blood) \n- Acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever, and \n\nother medicines to treat pain, inflammation and fever: ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, meloxicam and \nothers; \n\n- Medicines for treatment of hypertension or heart disease; \n- Medicines for treatment of diabetes; \n- Medicines for an upset stomach (for example antacids) and colestyramine (to lower cholesterol); \n- Medicines that reduce blood potassium levels: for example some diuretics or laxatives; \n- Cortisone or other corticosteroids, tetracosactide (used to test for adrenal function) or \n\naminogluthetimide (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome or breast cancer); \n- Antibiotics, with active substance names ending in –mycin and in –floxacin; antifungals (to treat fungal \n\ninfections) with active substance names ending in –conazole or amphotericin B injection; and anti-HIV \nmedicines with active substance names ending in –navir; \n\n- Rifampicin, rifabutin or isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis); \n- Praziquantel or ivermectin (for certain worm infections); \n- Oestrogen hormones including the contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy (HRT); \n- Anticonvulsants (for the treatment of epilepsy) and midazolam (used as sleeping pill and for the \n\ntreatment of epilepsy); \n- Aprepitant or fosaprepitant (for the treatment of nausea and vomiting after surgery or caused by \n\nchemotherapy [cancer treatment]); \n- Certain medicines to treat cancer: docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, lapatinib or methotrexate. \n\nMethotrexate is also used to treat rheumatism or psoriasis; \n- Erythropoietin (EPO, to treat anaemia) \n- Ciclosporin (for the treatment of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis or nephrotic \n\nsyndrome, and to suppress immune reactions after an organ or bone marrow transplantation) \n- Ephedrine (to treat asthma attacks or relieve nasal congestion). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you have recently received a vaccination or are planning to be vaccinated. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nNeofordex should not be taken if you are pregnant unless clearly indicated by your doctor.  \n \nYou must avoid getting pregnant during treatment with Neofordex.
