QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOrkambi 100 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of lumacaftor and 125 mg of ivacaftor. \n \nOrkambi 200 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of lumacaftor and 125 mg of ivacaftor. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n \nOrkambi 100 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets \n \nPink, oval-shaped tablets (dimensions 14 × 7.6 × 4.9 mm) printed with “1V125” in black ink on one \nside. \n \nOrkambi 200 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets \n \nPink, oval-shaped tablets (dimensions 14 × 8.4 × 6.8 mm) printed with “2V125” in black ink on one \nside. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOrkambi tablets are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and \nolder who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance \nregulator (CFTR) gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nOrkambi should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of CF. If the \npatient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to \nconfirm the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations in patients aged 6 years and older \n\nAge Dose Total daily dose \n6 to 11 years 2 tablets of lumacaftor \n\n100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every \n12 hours \n\nlumacaftor 400 mg/ \nivacaftor 500 mg \n\n12 years and older 2 tablets of lumacaftor \n200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every \n12 hours \n\nlumacaftor 800 mg/ \nivacaftor 500 mg \n\n \nPatients may start treatment on any day of the week. \nThis medicinal product should be taken with fat-containing food. A fat-containing meal or snack \nshould be consumed just before or just after dosing (see section 5.2). \n \nMissed dose \nIf less than 6 hours have passed since the missed dose, the scheduled dose should be taken with fat-\ncontaining food. If more than 6 hours have passed, the patient should be instructed to wait until the \nnext scheduled dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \nNo dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking \nOrkambi. However, when initiating treatment in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the \ndose to one tablet daily (lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg for patients aged 6 to 11 years; \nlumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg for patients aged 12 years and older) for the first week of \ntreatment to allow for the steady state induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, the \nrecommended daily dose should be continued. \n \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than one week and then re-initiated while taking strong CYP3A \ninhibitors, reduce the dose to one tablet daily (lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg for patients aged 6 \nto 11 years; lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg for patients aged 12 years and older) for the first \nweek of treatment re-initiation. Following this period, the recommended daily dose should be \ncontinued (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to \n30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). For \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), a dose reduction is recommended. \n \nThere is no experience of the use of the medicinal product in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. Therefore, after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment, Orkambi should be used \nwith caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, at a reduced dose (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.2). \n \nFor dose adjustments for patients with hepatic impairment see Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Dose adjustment recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment \n\nHepatic \nimpairment Dose adjustment Total daily dose \n\nMild hepatic \nimpairment  \n(Child-Pugh Class A) \n\nNo dose adjustment \n\nFor patients aged 6 \nto 11 years \n\n400 mg lumacaftor + 500 mg \nivacaftor \n \nFor patients aged 12 years and older \n800 mg lumacaftor + \n500 mg ivacaftor \n\nModerate hepatic \nimpairment  \n(Child-Pugh Class B) \n\nFor patients aged 6 to 11 years \n2 tablets of 100 mg/125 mg in the \nmorning + 1 tablet of 100 mg/125 \nmg in the evening (12 hours later) \n  \nFor patients aged 12 years and older \n2 tablets of 200 mg/125 mg in the \nmorning +  \n1 tablet of 200 mg/125 mg in the \nevening (12 hours later) \n\nFor patients aged 6 to 11 years \n300 mg lumacaftor + \n375 mg ivacaftor \n \n \nFor patients aged 12 years and older \n600 mg lumacaftor + \n375 mg ivacaftor \n\nSevere hepatic \nimpairment  \n(Child-Pugh Class C) \n\nFor patients aged 6 to 11 years \n1 tablet of 100 mg/125 mg in the \nmorning + \n1 tablet of 100 mg/125 mg in the \nevening (12 hours later) \nor \na reduced daily dose \n \nFor patients aged 12 years and older \n1 tablet of 200 mg/125 mg in the \nmorning +  \n1 tablet of 200 mg/125 mg in the \nevening (12 hours later)  \nor \na reduced daily dose \n\nFor patients aged 6 to 11 years \n200 mg lumacaftor + \n250 mg ivacaftor  \nor \na reduced daily dose \n \n \n \nFor patients aged 12 years and older \n400 mg lumacaftor + \n250 mg ivacaftor  \nor \na reduced daily dose \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Orkambi in children aged less than 2 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. Patients should not chew, break, or dissolve \nthe tablets. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nLumacaftor/ivacaftor is not effective in patients with CF who have the F508del mutation on one allele \nplus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in a lack of CFTR production or that is not \nresponsive to ivacaftor in vitro (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nLumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation \nin the CFTR gene on one allele, with or without the F508del mutation on the other allele. Since the \nexposure of ivacaftor is very significantly reduced when dosed in combination with lumacaftor, \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor should not be used in these patients. \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, and respiration \nabnormal) were more common during initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Serious respiratory \nevents were seen more frequently in patients with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in  1 \nsecond (ppFEV1) <40, and may lead to discontinuation of the medicinal product. Clinical experience \nin patients with ppFEV1 < 40 is limited and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended \nduring initiation of therapy (see section 4.8). A transient decline in FEV1 has also been observed in \nsome patients following initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. There is no experience of initiating \ntreatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation and initiating \ntreatment in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation is not advisable. \n \nEffect on blood pressure \n \nIncreased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Blood \npressure should be monitored periodically in all patients during treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with advanced liver disease \n \nAbnormalities in liver function, including advanced liver disease, can be present in patients with CF. \nWorsening of liver function in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported. Liver function \ndecompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-\nexisting cirrhosis with portal hypertension receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor should \nbe used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits are expected to \noutweigh the risks. If lumacaftor/ivacaftor is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored \nafter the initiation of treatment and the dose should be reduced (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nHepatobiliary adverse reactions \n \nElevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients with CF receiving \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor. In some instances, these elevations have been associated with concomitant \nelevations in total serum bilirubin. Transaminase elevations have been observed more frequently in \npaediatric patients than in adult patients (see section 4.8). \n \nBecause an association with liver injury cannot be excluded, assessments of liver function tests (ALT, \nAST and bilirubin) are recommended before initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor, every 3 months during the \nfirst year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin \nelevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. \n \nIn the event of significant elevation of ALT or AST, with or without elevated bilirubin (either ALT or \nAST > 5 x the upper limit of normal [ULN], or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN \nand/or clinical jaundice), dosing with lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be discontinued and laboratory tests \n\n\n\n6 \n\nclosely followed until the abnormalities resolve. A thorough investigation of potential causes should \nbe conducted and patients should be followed closely for clinical progression. Following resolution of \ntransaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming dosing should be considered (see \nsections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nSubstrates of CYP3A \nLumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or \nCYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nHormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied \nupon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with Orkambi (see section 4.5). \n \nStrong CYP3A inducers \nIvacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A \ninducers (e.g., rifampicin, St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended while using lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nCataracts \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric \npatients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor monotherapy. Although other risk factors were \npresent in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable \nto ivacaftor cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological \nexaminations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nLumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ \ntransplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for \ninteractions with immunosuppressants. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on exposure and indicated doses, the interaction profile is considered to be the same for all \nstrengths and pharmaceutical forms.  \n \nLumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A and ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as \nmonotherapy. There is potential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor when \nadministered concomitantly, and also for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A \nCo-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact \nthe exposure of lumacaftor, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of \n\n\n\n7 \n\nlumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state, the net exposure of ivacaftor when co-administered with a \nCYP3A inhibitor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of \n150 mg every 12 hours, the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy.  \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, when initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients taking strong CYP3A \ninhibitors, the dose should be adjusted (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitors. \n \nInducers of CYP3A \nCo-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal \neffect on the exposure of lumacaftor, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. Therefore, \nco-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not recommended with strong CYP3A inducers (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers. \n \nPotential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products \n \nCYP3A substrates \nLumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as \nmonotherapy. The net effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is expected to be strong CYP3A \ninduction. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with CYP3A substrates may decrease \nthe exposure of these substrates (see section 4.4). \n \nP-gp substrates \nIn vitro studies indicated that lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. \nAdditionally, a clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of \nP-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin) may alter \nthe exposure of these substrates. \n \nCYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates \nInteraction with CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates has not been investigated in vivo. In vitro studies \nsuggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; \nhowever, inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro \nstudies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor \nmay alter (i.e., either increase or decrease) the exposure of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates, decrease \nthe exposure of CYP2C19 substrates, and substantially decrease the exposure of CYP2B6 substrates. \n \nPotential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro experiments show that lumacaftor is a substrate for Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \nCo-administration of Orkambi with medicinal products that inhibit BCRP may increase plasma \nlumacaftor concentration. Lumacaftor inhibits the organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3. \nLumacaftor and ivacaftor are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of Orkambi with medicinal \nproducts that are substrates for OAT1/3 and BCRP transport may increase plasma concentrations of \nsuch medicinal products. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are not inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and \norganic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3. \n \nEstablished and other potentially significant interactions \n \nTable 3 provides the established or predicted effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on other medicinal \nproducts or the effect of other medicinal products on lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The information reported in \nTable 3 mostly derives from in vitro studies. The recommendations provided under “Clinical \ncomment” in Table 3 are based on interaction studies, clinical relevance, or predicted interactions due \nto elimination pathways. Interactions that have the most clinical relevance are listed first. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTable 3: Established and other potentially significant interactions - dose recommendations for \n\nuse of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with other medicinal products \n\nConcomitant \nmedicinal product \nclass: \nActive substance name Effect Clinical comment \nConcomitant medicinal products of most clinical relevance \nAnti-allergics: \nmontelukast \n\n \n↔ LUM, IVA \n \n \n \n↓ montelukast \nDue to the induction \nof CYP3A/2C8/2C9 \nby LUM \n\n \n \n \n \n \nNo dose adjustment for montelukast is \nrecommended.

An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify results. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animal studies with lumacaftor and ivacaftor do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to developmental and reproductive toxicity, whereas \neffects were noted with ivacaftor only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor during pregnancy unless the clinical \ncondition of the mother requires treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor and metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor into \nthe milk of lactating female rats. As such, risks to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision \nmust be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from lumacaftor/ \nivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the mother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effects of lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor on fertility are available. Lumacaftor had \nno effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats. Ivacaftor impaired \nfertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIvacaftor, which is one of the active components of Orkambi, has a minor influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients experiencing dizziness while taking Orkambi should be advised not to drive or use machines \nuntil symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions in Phase 3 clinical studies were dyspnoea (14.0% versus 7.8% on \nplacebo), diarrhoea (11.0% versus 8.4% on placebo), and nausea (10.2% versus 7.6% on placebo). \n \nSerious adverse reactions included hepatobiliary events, e.g., transaminase elevations, cholestatic \nhepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions identified from the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies (trials 1 and 2) in \npatients aged 12 years and older and from a 24-week, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 to \n11 years (trial 7), who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene are presented in \nTable 4 and are listed by system organ class and frequency. Adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor \nalone are also provided in Table 4. Adverse reactions are ranked under the MedDRA frequency \nclassification: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated \nusing the available data). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTable 4: Adverse reactions in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients and in patients treated with \nivacaftor alone \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations very common Nasopharyngitis* \n\ncommon Upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis \nVascular disorders uncommon Hypertension \nNervous system disorders very common Headache, dizziness* \n\nuncommon Hepatic encephalopathy† \nEar and labyrinth disorders common Ear pain*, ear discomfort*, tinnitus*, tympanic \n\nmembrane hyperaemia*, vestibular disorder* \nuncommon Ear congestion* \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nvery common Nasal congestion, dyspnoea, productive cough, \nsputum increased \n\ncommon Respiration abnormal, oropharyngeal pain, \nsinus congestion*, rhinorrhoea, pharyngeal \nerythema*, bronchospasm \n\nGastrointestinal disorders very common Abdominal pain*, abdominal pain upper, \ndiarrhoea, nausea \n\ncommon Flatulence, vomiting \nHepatobiliary disorders common Transaminase elevations \n\nuncommon Cholestatic hepatitis‡ \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\ncommon Rash \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\ncommon Menstruation irregular, dysmenorrhoea, \nmetrorrhagia, breast mass* \n\nuncommon Menorrhagia, amenorrhoea, polymenorrhoea, \nbreast inflammation*, gynaecomastia*, nipple \ndisorder*, nipple pain*, oligomenorrhoea \n\nInvestigations very common Bacteria in sputum* \ncommon Blood creatine phosphokinase increased \nuncommon Blood pressure increased \n\n* Adverse reactions and frequencies observed in patients in clinical studies with ivacaftor monotherapy \n† 1 patient out of 738 \n‡ 2 patients out of 738 \n \nThe safety data from 1,029 patients aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for up to an additional 96 weeks in the \nlong-term safety and efficacy rollover study (trial 3) were similar to the 24-week, placebo-controlled \nstudies (see section 5.1). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatobiliary adverse reactions \nDuring trials 1 and 2, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and \n> 3 x ULN was 0.8%, 2.0%, and 5.2%; and 0.5%, 1.9%, and 5.1% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor- and \nplacebo-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of transaminase-related adverse reactions was \n5.1% and 4.6% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients and those who received placebo, respectively. \nSeven patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor had liver-related serious adverse reactions with \nelevated transaminases, including 3 with concurrent elevation in total bilirubin. Following \ndiscontinuation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, liver function tests returned to baseline or improved \nsubstantially in all patients (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nAmong 7 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension who received \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, worsening liver function with \nincreased ALT, AST, bilirubin, and hepatic encephalopathy was observed in one patient. The event \noccurred within 5 days of the start of dosing and resolved following discontinuation of \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). \n \nPost–marketing cases of liver function decompensation including liver failure leading to death have \nbeen reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension who were treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions \nDuring trials 1 and 2, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, \nbronchospasm, and respiration abnormal) was 26.3% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients compared \nto 17.0% in patients who received placebo. The incidence of these adverse reactions was more \ncommon in patients with lower pre-treatment FEV1. Approximately three-quarters of the events began \nduring the first week of treatment, and in most patients the events resolved without dosing \ninterruption. The majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious and did \nnot result in treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring a 24-week, open label, Phase 3b clinical study (trial 5) in 46 patients aged 12 years and older \nwith advanced lung disease (ppFEV1 < 40) [mean ppFEV1 29.1 at baseline (range: 18.3 to 42.0)], the \nincidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 65.2%. In the subgroup of 28 patients who were \ninitiated at the full dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (2 tablets every 12 hours), the incidence was 71.4%, \nand in the 18 patients who were initiated at a reduced dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (1 tablet every 12 \nhours for up to 2 weeks, and subsequently increased to the full dose), the incidence was 55.6%. Of the \npatients who were initiated lumacaftor/ivacaftor at the full dose, one patient had a serious respiratory \nadverse reaction, three patients subsequently had their dose reduced, and three patients discontinued \ntreatment. No serious respiratory adverse reactions, dose reductions or discontinuations were seen in \npatients who were initiated at the half dose (see section 4.4). \n \nMenstrual abnormalities \nDuring trials 1 and 2, the incidence of combined menstrual abnormalities (amenorrhoea, \ndysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, metrorrhagia, oligomenorrhoea, and \npolymenorrhoea) was 9.9 % in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated female patients and 1.7% in \nplacebo-treated females. These menstrual events occurred more frequently in the subset of female \npatients who were taking hormonal contraceptives (25.0%) versus patients who were not taking \nhormonal contraceptives (3.5%) (see section 4.5). Most of these reactions were mild or moderate in \nseverity and non-serious. In lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients, approximately two-thirds of these \nreactions resolved, and the median duration was 10 days. \n \nIncreased blood pressure \nDuring trials 1 and 2, adverse reactions related to increased blood pressure (e.g., hypertension, blood \npressure increased) were reported in 0.9% (7/738) of patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and in \nno patients who received placebo. \n \nIn patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor (mean baseline 114 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg \ndiastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was \n3.1 mmHg and 1.8 mmHg, respectively. In patients who received placebo (mean baseline 114 mmHg \nsystolic and 69 mmHg diastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic \nblood pressure was 0.9 mmHg and 0.9 mmHg, respectively. \n \nThe proportion of patients who experienced a systolic blood pressure value > 140 mmHg or a diastolic \nblood pressure > 90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 3.4% and 1.5% in patients treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 0.5% in patients who received placebo \n(see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nSafety data were evaluated in 60 patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 8), 161 patients aged 6 to 11 years \n(trials 6 and 7) and in 194 patients aged 12 to 17 years with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation and who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor in clinical studies. Patients aged 12 to 17 years were \nincluded in trials 1 and 2. \nThe safety profile in these paediatric patients is generally consistent with that in adult patients.  \n \nLong-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 57 patients aged 2 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene were generally consistent with the \n24-week parent study in patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 8) and safety data in patients aged 6 to \n11 years. \n \nLong-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 239 patients aged 6 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (trial 9) were generally consistent \nwith the 24-week parent studies in patients aged 6 to 11 years (trial 6 and trial 7). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions for patients aged 6 to 11 years \nHepatobiliary adverse reactions \nDuring the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 58 patients aged 6 to 11 years (trial 6), the \nincidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and >3 x ULN was 5.3%, 8.8%, \nand 19.3%. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor dosing was \nmaintained or successfully resumed after interruption in all patients with transaminase elevations, \nexcept 1 patient who discontinued treatment permanently. \n \nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study in 204 patients aged 6 to 11 years \n(trial 7), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN was \n1.0%, 4.9%, and 12.6% in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, and 2.0%, 3.0%, and 7.9% in the \nplacebo-treated patients. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Two patients in the \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor group and two patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment permanently \ndue to transaminase elevations. \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions \nDuring the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study (trial 6) in 58 patients aged 6 to 11 years (mean \nbaseline ppFEV1 was 91.4), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 6.9% (4/58). \n \nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study (trial 7) in patients aged 6 to 11 years \n(mean baseline ppFEV1 was 89.8), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 18.4% in \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor patients and 12.9% in placebo patients. A decline in ppFEV1 at initiation of \ntherapy was observed during serial post dose spirometry assessments. The absolute change from pre-\ndose at 4-6 hours post-dose was -7.7 on day 1 and -1.3 on day 15 in lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients. The \npost-dose decline was resolved by week 16. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose \nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\nAdverse reactions that occurred at an increased incidence of ≥ 5% in the supratherapeutic dose period \ncompared with the therapeutic dose period were headache, generalised rash, and increased \ntransaminase. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products; ATC code: R07AX30 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. \nThe F508del mutation impacts the CFTR protein in multiple ways, primarily by causing a defect in \ncellular processing and trafficking that reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small \namount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface has low channel-open probability (defective \nchannel gating). Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector that acts directly on F508del-CFTR to improve its \ncellular processing and trafficking, thereby increasing the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell \nsurface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the \nchannel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of \nlumacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, \nresulting in increased chloride ion transport. The exact mechanisms by which lumacaftor improves \ncellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR and ivacaftor potentiates F508del-CFTR are not \nknown. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEffects on sweat chloride \nChanges in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were \nevaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF aged 18 years \nand older. In this trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation) completed dosing with \nlumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an \nadditional 28 days, and 25 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for F508del) completed dosing with \nplacebo. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as \nmean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 28 was statistically significant at -8.2 mmol/L \n(95% CI: -14, -2). The treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor \n250 mg q12h and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 56 was \nstatistically significant at -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4). \n \nIn trial 7 (see Clinical efficacy and safety) in patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation \naged 6 to 11 years, the treatment difference (LS mean) in sweat chloride for the absolute change at \nweek 24 as compared to placebo was -24.9 mmol/L (nominal P < 0.0001). The treatment difference \n(LS mean) in sweat chloride for the average absolute change at day 15 and at week 4 as compared to \nplacebo was -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -23.4, -18.2; nominal P < 0.0001). \n \nChanges in FEV1 \nChanges in ppFEV1 in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were also \nevaluated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial in patients with CF aged 18 years and \nolder. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean \nabsolute change in ppFEV1 was -4.6 percentage points (95% CI: -9.6, 0.4) from baseline to day 28, 4.2 \npercentage points (95% CI: –1.3, 9.7) from baseline to day 56, and 7.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.6, \n12.8; statistically significant) from day 28 to day 56 (following the addition of ivacaftor to lumacaftor \nmonotherapy). \n \nDecrease in heart rate \n\n\n\n19 \n\nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, a maximum decrease in mean heart rate of \n6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed on day 1 and day 15 around 4 to 6 hours after \ndosing. After day 15, heart rate was not monitored in the period after dosing in these studies. From \nweek 4, the change in mean heart rate at pre-dose ranged from 1 to 2 bpm below baseline among \npatients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The percentage of patients with heart rate values < 50 bpm \non treatment was 11% for patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor, compared to 4.9% for patients \nwho received placebo. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nNo meaningful changes in QTc interval or blood pressure were observed in a thorough QT clinical \nstudy evaluating lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once \ndaily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTrials in patients with CF aged 12 years and above who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in \nthe CFTR gene \nThe efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical \ntrials of 1,108 clinically stable patients with CF, in which 737 patients were randomised to and dosed \nwith lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Patients in both trials were randomised 1:1:1 to receive lumacaftor 600 mg \nonce daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, or placebo. \nPatients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF \ntherapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline). Patients from \nthese trials were eligible to roll over into a blinded extension study. \n \nTrial 1 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.1 years) with \npercent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.7 at baseline [range: \n31.1 to 94.0]). Trial 2 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 years) with \nppFEV1 at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.5 at baseline [range: 31.3 to 99.8]). Patients \nwith a history of colonisation with organisms such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, \nor Mycobacterium abscessus or who had 3 or more abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, \nGGT ≥ 3 times the ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN) were excluded. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at \nweek 24. Other efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, absolute change \nfrom baseline in BMI, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the proportion of \npatients achieving ≥ 5% relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24, and the number of \npulmonary exacerbations (including those requiring hospitalisation or IV antibiotic therapy) through \nweek 24. \n \nIn both trials, treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant improvement in \nppFEV1 (Table 5). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was rapid in onset (day 15) and sustained \nthroughout the 24-week treatment period. At day 15, the treatment difference between lumacaftor \n400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from \nbaseline was 2.51 percentage points in the pooled trials 1 and 2 (P < 0.0001). Improvements in \nppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex and geographic region. The Phase 3 \ntrials of lumacaftor/ivacaftor included 81 patients with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline. The treatment \ndifference in this subgroup was comparable to that observed in patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 40. At \nweek-24, the treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo for \nthe mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from baseline in the pooled trials 1 and 2 were 3.39 \npercentage points (P = 0.0382) for patients with ppFEV1 < 40 and 2.47 percentage points (P < 0.0001) \nfor patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 40. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 5: Summary of primary and key secondary outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2* \n Trial 1 Trial 2 Pooled (trial 1 and trial 2) \n\nPlacebo \n(n = 184) \n\nLUM 400 mg \nq12h/ IVA \n\n250 mg q12h \n(n = 182) \n\nPlacebo \n(n = 187) \n\nLUM 400 mg \nq12h/IVA \n\n250 mg q12h \n(n = 187) \n\nPlacebo \n(n = 371) \n\nLUM 400 mg \nq12h/IVA \n\n250 mg q12h \n(n = 369) \n\nAbsolute change in \nppFEV1 at week 24 \n(percentage points) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n2.41 \n(P = 0.0003) † – \n\n2.65 \n(P = 0.0011) † – \n\n2.55 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n-0.73 \n(P = 0.2168) \n\n1.68 \n(P = 0.0051) \n\n-0.02 \n(P = 0.9730) \n\n2.63 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n-0.39 \n(P < 0.3494) \n\n2.16 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nRelative change in \nppFEV1 at week 24 \n(%) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n4.15 \n(P = 0.0028)† – \n\n4.69 \n( P =0.0009)† – \n\n4.4 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n-0.85 \n(P = 0.3934) \n\n3.3 \n(P = 0.0011) \n\n0.16 \n(P = 0.8793) \n\n4.85 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n-0.34 \n(P = 0.6375) \n\n4.1 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nAbsolute change in \nBMI at week 24 \n(kg/m2) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n0.13 \n(P = 0.1938) – \n\n0.36 \n(P < 0.0001)† – \n\n0.24 \n(P = 0.0004) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n0.19 \n(P = 0.0065) \n\n0.32 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n0.07 \n(P = 0.2892) \n\n0.43 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n0.13 \n(P = 0.0066) \n\n0.37 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nAbsolute change in \nCFQ-R \nRespiratory \nDomain Score at \nweek 24 (points) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n1.5 \n(P = 0.3569) – \n\n2.9 \n(P = 0.0736) – \n\n2.2 \n(P = 0.0512) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n1.1 \n(P = 0.3423) \n\n2.6 \n(P = 0.0295) \n\n2.8 \n(P = 0.0152) \n\n5.7 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n1.9 \n(P = 0.0213) \n\n4.1 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nProportion of \npatients with ≥5% \nrelative change in \nppFEV1 at week 24 \n\n% 25% 32% 26% 41% 26% 37% \n\nOdds ratio – 1.43 (P = 0.1208) – \n1.90 \n\n(P = 0.0032) – \n1.66 \n\n(P = 0.0013) \n\nNumber of \npulmonary \nexacerbations \nthrough week 24 \n\n# of events \n(rate per 48 \n\nwks) \n112 (1.07) 73 (0.71) 139 (1.18) 79 (0.67) 251 (1.14) 152 (0.70) \n\nRate ratio – 0.66 (P = 0.0169) – \n0.57 \n\n(P = 0.0002) – \n0.61 \n\n(P < 0.0001) \n\n* In each study, a hierarchical testing procedure was performed within each active treatment arm for primary and secondary \nendpoints vs. placebo; at each step, P ≤ 0.0250 and all previous tests also meeting this level of significance was required for \nstatistical significance. \n\n† Indicates statistical significance confirmed in the hierarchical testing procedure. \n \nAt week 24, the proportion of patients who remained free from pulmonary exacerbations was \nsignificantly higher for patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor compared with placebo.

This extension trial was designed to \nevaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 1,108 patients \nwho received any treatment in trial 1 or trial 2, 1,029 (93%) were dosed and received active treatment \n(lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h or lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor \n250 mg q12h) in trial 3 for up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e., up to a total of 120 weeks). The primary \n\n\n\n21 \n\nefficacy analysis of this extension study included data up to week 72 of trial 3 with a sensitivity \nanalysis that included data up to week 96 of trial 3.  \n \nPatients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 1 or trial 2 showed an effect that was maintained with \nrespect to baseline after an additional 96 weeks through trial 3. For patients who transitioned from \nplacebo to active treatment similar changes as those observed in patients treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 1 or trial 2 were seen (see Table 5).

The exposure of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult \nvolunteers and patients with CF. After twice-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of \nlumacaftor and ivacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after approximately 7 days of \ntreatment, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.9 for lumacaftor.

Subjects treated with LUM/IVA in either parent study [trial 6 (n=49) or trial 7 (n=94)] and continued active \nLUM/IVA treatment in the extension (L/I-L/I).  \n‡Baseline for both groups (P-L/I and L/I-L/I) was the trial 6 and trial 7 (parent study) baseline and the corresponding n \nrefers to the analysis set in the parent study. \n**The LCI sub-study included 117 subjects in the L/I-L/I group and 96 subjects in the P-L/I group. \n†FAS = full analysis set (n=103) includes subjects who received L/I in trial 7 and in trial 9, assessed over the \ncumulative study period for L/I; ROS = rollover set (n=96) includes subjects who received placebo in trial 7 and L/I in \ntrial 9, assessed over the current study period in for trial 9.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\nof ivacaftor is lower than that of day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nAfter oral administration of lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in a fed state, the \nsteady-state mean (± SD) for AUC0-12h and Cmax were 198 (64.8) µg∙h/mL and 25.0 (7.96) µg/mL for \nlumacaftor, respectively, and 3.66 (2.25) µg∙h/mL and 0.602 (0.304) µg/mL for ivacaftor, respectively. \nAfter oral administration of ivacaftor alone as 150 mg q12h in a fed state, the steady-state mean (± SD) \nfor AUC0-12h and Cmax were 9.08 (3.20) µg∙h/mL and 1.12 (0.319) µg/mL, respectively. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing multiple oral doses of lumacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased \nproportional to dose over the range of 50 mg to 1000 mg every 24 hours. The exposure of lumacaftor \nincreased approximately 2.0-fold when given with fat-containing food relative to fasted conditions. \nThe median (range) tmax of lumacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 9.0) in the fed state. \n \nFollowing multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure \nof ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg every 12 hours. The \nexposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor increased approximately 3-fold \nwhen given with fat-containing food in healthy volunteers. Therefore, lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be \nadministered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax of ivacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours \n(2.0; 6.0) in the fed state. \n \nDistribution \n \nLumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. After oral \nadministration of 400 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in a fed state, the typical apparent \nvolumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments [coefficient of variation as a \npercentage (CV)] were estimated to be 23.5 L (48.7%) and 33.3 L (30.5%), respectively. \n \nIvacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and \nalbumin. After oral administration of ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours in combination with lumacaftor, \nthe typical apparent volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments (CV) were \nestimated to be 95.0 L (53.9%) and 201 L (26.6%), respectively. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that lumacaftor is a substrate of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLumacaftor is not extensively metabolised in humans, with the majority of lumacaftor excreted \nunchanged in the faeces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolised via \noxidation and glucuronidation. \n \nIvacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. \nM1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. \nM6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted unchanged \nin the faeces. There was negligible urinary excretion of lumacaftor as unchanged drug. The apparent \nterminal half-life is approximately 26 hours. The typical apparent clearance, CL/F (CV), of lumacaftor \nwas estimated to be 2.38 L/h (29.4%) for patients with CF. \n \nFollowing oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the \nfaeces after metabolic conversion. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged \n\n\n\n26 \n\ndrug. In healthy subjects, the half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is approximately 9 \nhours. The typical CL/F (CV) of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor was estimated \nto be 25.1 L/h (40.5%) for patients with CF. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired \nhepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had higher exposures (AUC0-12h by approximately \n50% and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. The \nimpact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) on pharmacokinetics of \nlumacaftor given in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in exposure is \nexpected to be less than 50%. \n \nStudies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, \nscore 10 to 15), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with renal \nimpairment. In a human pharmacokinetic study with lumacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination \nof lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine \nwith 0.18% as unchanged parent). In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was \nminimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was \nrecovered in the urine). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of clearance versus creatinine \nclearance shows no trend for subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nThe safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 65 years or older have not been \nevaluated. \n \nGender \n \nThe effect of gender on lumacaftor pharmacokinetics was evaluated using a population \npharmacokinetics analysis of data from clinical studies of lumacaftor given in combination with \nivacaftor. Results indicate no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters for \nlumacaftor or ivacaftor between males and females. No dose adjustments are necessary based on \ngender. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe exposures are similar between adults and the paediatric population based on population (PK) \nanalyses as presented in Table 9: \n \nTable 9: Mean (SD) lumacaftor and ivacaftor exposure by age group \n\nAge group Dose \nMean lumacaftor \n\n(SD) \nAUCss (μg/mL*h) \n\nMean ivacaftor (SD) \nAUCss (μg/mL*h) \n\nPatients aged 6 to 11 years lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor \n250 mg every 12 hours  \n\n203 (57.4) 5.26 (3.08) \n\nPatients aged 12 to less than \n18 years  \n\nlumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor \n250 mg every 12 hours  \n\n241 (61.4) 3.90 (1.56) \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLumacaftor \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction and development. Specific studies to evaluate the phototoxic potential of lumacaftor were \nnot conducted; however, evaluation of the available non-clinical and clinical data suggests no \nphototoxic liability. \n \nIvacaftor \n \nEffects in repeated dose studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess \n(> 25-, > 45-, and > 35-fold for mice, rats, and dogs, respectively) of the maximum human exposure of \nivacaftor when administered as Orkambi, indicating little relevance to clinical use. Non-clinical data \nreveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity and carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nSafety pharmacology \nIvacaftor produced concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on hERG (human ether-à-go-go related \ngene) tail currents, with an IC15 of 5.5 µM, compared to the Cmax (1.5 µM) for ivacaftor at the \ntherapeutic dose for lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, no ivacaftor-induced QT prolongation was \nobserved in a dog telemetry study at single doses up to 60 mg/kg or in ECG measurements from \nrepeat-dose studies of up to 1 year duration at the 60 mg/kg/day dose level in dogs (Cmax after \n365 days = 36.2 to 47.6 μM). Ivacaftor produced a dose-related but transient increase in the blood \npressure parameters in dogs at single oral doses up to 60 mg/kg (see section 5.1).  \n \nPregnancy and fertility \nIvacaftor was not teratogenic when dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the organogenesis \nstage of foetal development at doses approximately 7 times (ivacaftor and metabolite exposure) and 46 \ntimes the ivacaftor exposure in humans at the therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor dose, respectively. At \nmaternally toxic doses in rats, ivacaftor produced reductions in foetal body weight; an increase in the \nincidence of variations in cervical ribs, hypoplastic ribs, and wavy ribs; and sternal irregularities, \nincluding fusions. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. \n \nIvacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at \n200 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 11 and 7 times, respectively, those obtained with \nthe maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed \nAUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 150 mg/kg/day in the \n6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the pilot embryofoetal \ndevelopment study in this species) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. No \neffects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at \n≤ 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 8 and 5 times, respectively, those obtained with \nthe maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed \nAUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 100 mg/kg/day in the \n6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the embryofoetal development \nstudy in this species). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nPeri- and post-natal development \nIvacaftor did not cause developmental defects in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally from \npregnancy through parturition and weaning at 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures that were \napproximately 4 times those obtained with the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor \ncomponent of Orkambi based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Doses above \n100 mg/kg/day resulted in survival and lactation indices that were 92% and 98% of control values, \nrespectively, as well as reductions in pup body weights.  \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nJuvenile animals \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed with ivacaftor at 0.32 times the maximum \nrecommended human dose based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when \nco-administered with lumacaftor as Orkambi. Cataracts were not observed in foetuses derived from rat \ndams treated during the organogenesis stage of foetal development, in rat pups exposed to a certain \nextent through milk ingestion prior to weaning, or in repeated dose toxicity studies with ivacaftor. The \npotential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n \nLumacaftor and ivacaftor \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies involving the co-administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor revealed no \nspecial hazard for humans in terms of potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicities. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules \n \nWhite to off-white granules. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOrkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and \nolder who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance \nregulator (CFTR) gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nOrkambi should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of CF. If the \npatient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to \nconfirm the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene. \n \nPosology \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations in patients aged 2 years and older \n\n\n\n31 \n\nAge Orkambi dose Total daily dose \n2 to 5 years and \nweighing less than 14 kg \n\nOne sachet of lumacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every 12 \nhours \n\nlumacaftor 200 mg/ \nivacaftor 250 mg \n\n2 to 5 years and \nweighing 14 kg or \ngreater  \n\nOne sachet of lumacaftor \n150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg every 12 \nhours \n\nlumacaftor 300 mg/ \nivacaftor 376 mg \n\n6 years and older See Orkambi tablets SmPC for further details \n \nPatients may start treatment on any day of the week. \nThis medicinal product should be taken with fat-containing food. A fat-containing meal or snack \nshould be consumed just before or just after dosing (see section 5.2). \n \nMissed dose \nIf less than 6 hours have passed since the missed dose, the scheduled dose should be taken with fat-\ncontaining food. If more than 6 hours have passed, the patient should be instructed to wait until the \nnext scheduled dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \nNo dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking \nOrkambi. However, when initiating treatment in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the \ndose to one sachet (lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg for patients aged 2 to 5 years and weighing \nless than 14 kg; lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg for patients aged 2 to 5 years and weighing 14 kg \nor greater) every other day for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady state induction effect \nof lumacaftor. Following this period, the recommended daily dose should be continued. \n \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than one week and then re-initiated while taking strong CYP3A \ninhibitors, reduce the dose to one sachet (lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg for patients aged 2 to \n5 years and weighing less than 14 kg; lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg for patients aged 2 to \n5 years and weighing 14 kg or greater) every other day for the first week of treatment re-initiation. \nFollowing this period, the recommended daily dose should be continued (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to \n30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). For \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), a dose reduction is recommended. \n \nThere is no experience of the use of the medicinal product in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. Therefore, after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment, Orkambi should be used \nwith caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a reduced dose (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.2). \n \nFor dose adjustments for patients with hepatic impairment see Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTable 2: Dose adjustment recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment Dose adjustment Total daily dose \n\nMild hepatic \nimpairment  \n(Child-Pugh Class A) \n\nNo dose adjustment \n\nFor patients aged 2 to 5 years \nand < 14 kg \n\nlumacaftor 200 mg + ivacaftor 250 mg \n \nFor patients aged 2 to 5 years \nand ≥ 14 kg \n\nlumacaftor 300 mg + ivacaftor 376 mg \n \n\nModerate hepatic \nimpairment  \n(Child-Pugh Class B) \n\n1 sachet every morning \nand 1 sachet in the \nevening every other day. \n\nFor patients aged 2 to 5 years \nand < 14 kg \n\nday 1: lumacaftor 200 mg + ivacaftor 250 mg \nday 2: lumacaftor 100 mg + ivacaftor 125 mg \n\n \nFor patients aged 2 to 5 years and ≥ 14 kg \n\nday 1: lumacaftor 300 mg + ivacaftor 376 mg \nday 2: lumacaftor 150 mg + ivacaftor 188 mg \n\n \n\nSevere hepatic \nimpairment  \n(Child-Pugh Class C) \n\n1 sachet per day or less \nfrequently \n\nFor patients aged 2 to 5 years \nand < 14 kg \n\nlumacaftor 100 mg + ivacaftor 125 mg \n \nFor patients aged 2 to5 years and ≥ 14 kg \n\nlumacaftor 150 mg + ivacaftor 188 mg \n \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Orkambi in children aged less than 2 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use.  \n \nEach sachet is for single use only. \n \nThe entire content of each sachet of granules should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) of \nage-appropriate soft food or liquid and the mixture completely consumed. Some examples of soft \nfoods include puréed fruits, flavoured yogurt, and milk or juice. Food or liquid should be at room \ntemperature or below. Once mixed, the product has been shown to be stable for one hour, and \ntherefore should be ingested during this period.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nLumacaftor/ivacaftor is not effective in patients with CF who have the F508del mutation on one allele \nplus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in a lack of CFTR production or that is not \nresponsive to ivacaftor in vitro (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nPatients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nLumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation \nin the CFTR gene on one allele, with or without the F508del mutation on the other allele. Since the \nexposure of ivacaftor is very significantly reduced when dosed in combination with lumacaftor, \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor should not be used in these patients. \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, and respiration \nabnormal) were more common during initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Serious respiratory \nevents were seen more frequently in patients with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in the \n1st second (ppFEV1) <40, and may lead to discontinuation of the medicinal product. Clinical \nexperience in patients with ppFEV1 <40 is limited and additional monitoring of these patients is \nrecommended during initiation of therapy (see section 4.8). A transient decline in FEV1 has also been \nobserved in some patients following initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. There is no experience of \ninitiating treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation and \ninitiating treatment in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation is not advisable. \n \nEffect on blood pressure \n \nIncreased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Blood \npressure should be monitored periodically in all patients during treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with advanced liver disease \n \nAbnormalities in liver function, including advanced liver disease, can be present in patients with CF. \nWorsening of liver function in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported. Liver function \ndecompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-\nexisting cirrhosis with portal hypertension receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor should \nbe used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits are expected to \noutweigh the risks. If lumacaftor/ivacaftor is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored \nafter the initiation of treatment and the dose should be reduced (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \nHepatobiliary adverse reactions \n \nElevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients with CF receiving \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor. In some instances, these elevations have been associated with concomitant \nelevations in total serum bilirubin. Transaminase elevations have been observed more frequently in \npaediatric patients than in adult patients. Among different age paediatric cohorts, in the 2 to 5 years old \npatients, transaminase elevations have been observed more frequently than in the 6 to 11 years old (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nBecause an association with liver injury cannot be excluded, assessments of liver function tests (ALT, \nAST and bilirubin) are recommended before initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor, every 3 months during the \nfirst year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin \nelevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. \n \nIn the event of significant elevation of ALT or AST, with or without elevated bilirubin (either ALT or \nAST > 5 x the upper limit of normal [ULN], or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN \nand/or clinical jaundice), dosing with lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be discontinued and laboratory tests \nclosely followed until the abnormalities resolve. A thorough investigation of potential causes should \nbe conducted and patients should be followed closely for clinical progression. Following resolution of \ntransaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming dosing should be considered (see \nsections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nSubstrates of CYP3A \nLumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or \nCYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nHormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied \nupon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with Orkambi (see section 4.5). \n \nStrong CYP3A inducers \nIvacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A \ninducers (e.g., rifampicin, St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended while using lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nCataracts \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric \npatients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor monotherapy. Although other risk factors were \npresent in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable \nto ivacaftor cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological \nexaminations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nLumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ \ntransplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for \ninteractions with immunosuppressants. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on exposure and indicated doses, the interaction profile is considered to be the same for all \nstrengths and pharmaceutical forms. \n \nLumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A and ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as \nmonotherapy. There is potential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor when \nadministered concomitantly, and also for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A \nCo-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact \nthe exposure of lumacaftor, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of \nlumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state, the net exposure of ivacaftor when co-administered with a \nCYP3A inhibitor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of \n150 mg every 12 hours, the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy.  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, when initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients taking strong CYP3A \ninhibitors, the dose should be adjusted (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitors. \n \nInducers of CYP3A \nCo-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal \neffect on the exposure of lumacaftor, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. Therefore, \nco-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not recommended with strong CYP3A inducers (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers. \n \nPotential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products \n \nCYP3A substrates \nLumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as \nmonotherapy. The net effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is expected to be strong CYP3A \ninduction. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with CYP3A substrates may decrease \nthe exposure of these substrates (see section 4.4). \n \nP-gp substrates \nIn vitro studies indicated that lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. \nAdditionally, a clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of \nP-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin) may alter \nthe exposure of these substrates. \n \nCYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates \nInteraction with CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates has not been investigated in vivo. In vitro studies \nsuggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; \nhowever, inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro \nstudies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor \nmay alter (i.e., either increase or decrease) the exposure of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates, decrease \nthe exposure of CYP2C19 substrates, and substantially decrease the exposure of CYP2B6 substrates. \n \nPotential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro experiments show that lumacaftor is a substrate for Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \nCo-administration of Orkambi with medicinal products that inhibit BCRP may increase plasma \nlumacaftor concentration. Lumacaftor inhibits the organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3. \nLumacaftor and ivacaftor are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of Orkambi with medicinal \nproducts that are substrates for OAT1/3 and BCRP transport may increase plasma concentrations of \nsuch medicinal products. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are not inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and \norganic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3. \n \nEstablished and other potentially significant interactions \n \nTable 3 provides the established or predicted effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on other medicinal \nproducts or the effect of other medicinal products on lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The information reported in \nTable 3 mostly derives from in vitro studies. The recommendations provided under “Clinical \ncomment” in Table 3 are based on interaction studies, clinical relevance, or predicted interactions due \nto elimination pathways. Interactions that have the most clinical relevance are listed first. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTable 3: Established and other potentially significant interactions - dose recommendations for \nuse of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with other medicinal products \n\nConcomitant \nmedicinal product \nclass: \nActive substance name Effect Clinical comment \nConcomitant medicinal products of most clinical relevance \nAnti-allergics: \nmontelukast \n\n \n↔ LUM, IVA \n \n \n \n↓ montelukast \nDue to the induction \nof CYP3A/2C8/2C9 \nby LUM \n\n \n \n \n \n \nNo dose adjustment for montelukast is \nrecommended.

An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify results. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animal studies with lumacaftor and ivacaftor do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to developmental and reproductive toxicity, whereas \neffects were noted with ivacaftor only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor during pregnancy unless the clinical \ncondition of the mother requires treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor and metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor into \nthe milk of lactating female rats. As such, risks to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision \nmust be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for the mother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effects of lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor on fertility are available. Lumacaftor had \nno effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats. Ivacaftor impaired \nfertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats(see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIvacaftor, which is one of the active components of Orkambi, has a minor influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients experiencing dizziness while taking Orkambi should be advised not to drive or use machines \nuntil symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions in Phase 3 clinical studies were dyspnoea (14.0% versus 7.8% on \nplacebo), diarrhoea (11.0% versus 8.4% on placebo), and nausea (10.2% versus 7.6% on placebo). \n \nSerious adverse reactions included hepatobiliary events, e.g., transaminase elevations, cholestatic \nhepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions identified from the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies (trials 1 and 2) in \npatients aged 12 years and older and from a 24-week, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 to \n11 years (trial 7), who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene are presented in \nTable 4 and are listed by system organ class and frequency. Adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor \nalone are also provided in Table 4. Adverse reactions are ranked under the MedDRA frequency \nclassification: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated \nusing the available data). \n \nTable 4: Adverse reactions in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients and in patients treated with \n\nivacaftor alone \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations very common Nasopharyngitis* \n\ncommon Upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis \nVascular disorders uncommon Hypertension \nNervous system disorders very common Headache, dizziness* \n\nuncommon Hepatic encephalopathy† \nEar and labyrinth disorders common Ear pain*, ear discomfort*, tinnitus*, tympanic \n\nmembrane hyperaemia*, vestibular disorder* \nuncommon Ear congestion* \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nvery common Nasal congestion, dyspnoea, productive cough, \nsputum increased \n\ncommon Respiration abnormal, oropharyngeal pain, \nsinus congestion*, rhinorrhoea, pharyngeal \nerythema*, bronchospasm \n\nGastrointestinal disorders very common Abdominal pain*, abdominal pain upper, \ndiarrhoea, nausea \n\ncommon Flatulence, vomiting \nHepatobiliary disorders common Transaminase elevations \n\nuncommon Cholestatic hepatitis‡ \n\n\n\n43 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\ncommon Rash \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\ncommon Menstruation irregular, dysmenorrhoea, \nmetrorrhagia, breast mass* \n\nuncommon Menorrhagia, amenorrhoea, polymenorrhoea, \nbreast inflammation*, gynaecomastia*, nipple \ndisorder*, nipple pain*, oligomenorrhoea \n\nInvestigations very common Bacteria in sputum* \ncommon Blood creatine phosphokinase increased \nuncommon Blood pressure increased \n\n*Adverse reactions and frequencies observed in patients in clinical studies with ivacaftor monotherapy .  \n† 1 patient out of 738 \n‡ 2 patients out of 738 \n \nThe safety data from 1,029 patients aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for up to an additional 96 weeks in the \nlong-term safety and efficacy rollover study (trial 3) were similar to the 24-week, placebo-controlled \nstudies (see section 5.1). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatobiliary adverse reactions \nDuring trials 1 and 2, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and \n> 3 x ULN was 0.8%, 2.0%, and 5.2%; and 0.5%, 1.9%, and 5.1% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor- and \nplacebo-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of transaminase-related adverse reactions was \n5.1% and 4.6% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients and those who received placebo, respectively. \nSeven patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor had liver-related serious adverse reactions with \nelevated transaminases, including 3 with concurrent elevation in total bilirubin. Following \ndiscontinuation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, liver function tests returned to baseline or improved \nsubstantially in all patients (see section 4.4). \n \nAmong 7 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension who received \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, worsening liver function with \nincreased ALT, AST, bilirubin, and hepatic encephalopathy was observed in one patient. The event \noccurred within 5 days of the start of dosing and resolved following discontinuation of \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). \n \nPost–marketing cases of liver function decompensation including liver failure leading to death have \nbeen reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension who were treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions \nDuring trials 1 and 2, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, \nbronchospasm, and respiration abnormal) was 26.3% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients compared \nto 17.0% in patients who received placebo. The incidence of these adverse reactions was more \ncommon in patients with lower pre-treatment FEV1. Approximately three-quarters of the adverse \nreactions began during the first week of treatment, and in most patients the events resolved without \ndosing interruption. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious and did not \nresult in treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring a 24-week, open label, Phase 3b clinical study (trial 5) in 46 patients aged 12 years and older \nwith advanced lung disease (ppFEV1 < 40) [mean ppFEV1 29.1 at baseline (range: 18.3 to 42.0)], the \nincidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 65.2%. In the subgroup of 28 patients who were \ninitiated at the full dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (2 tablets every 12 hours), the incidence was 71.4%, \nand in the 18 patients who were initiated at a reduced dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (1 tablet every 12 \n\n\n\n44 \n\nhours for up to 2 weeks, and subsequently increased to the full dose), the incidence was 55.6%. Of the \npatients who were initiated lumacaftor/ivacaftor at the full dose, one patient had a serious respiratory \nadverse reaction, three patients subsequently had their dose reduced, and three patients discontinued \ntreatment. No serious respiratory adverse reactions, dose reductions or discontinuations were seen in \npatients who were initiated at the half dose (see section 4.4). \n \nMenstrual abnormalities \nDuring trials 1 and 2, the incidence of combined menstrual abnormalities (amenorrhoea, \ndysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, metrorrhagia, oligomenorrhoea, and \npolymenorrhoea) was 9.9% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated female patients and 1.7% in \nplacebo-treated females. These menstrual events occurred more frequently in the subset of female \npatients who were taking hormonal contraceptives (25.0%) versus patients who were not taking \nhormonal contraceptives (3.5%) (see section 4.5). Most of these reactions were mild or moderate in \nseverity and non-serious. In lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients, approximately two-thirds of these \nreactions resolved, and the median duration was 10 days. \n \nIncreased blood pressure \nDuring trials 1 and 2, adverse reactions related to increased blood pressure (e.g., hypertension, blood \npressure increased) were reported in 0.9% (7/738) of patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and in \nno patients who received placebo. \n \nIn patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor (mean baseline 114 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg \ndiastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.1 \nmmHg and 1.8 mmHg, respectively. In patients who received placebo (mean baseline 114 mmHg \nsystolic and 69 mmHg diastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic \nblood pressure was 0.9 mmHg and 0.9 mmHg, respectively. \n \nThe proportion of patients who experienced a systolic blood pressure value > 140 mmHg or a diastolic \nblood pressure > 90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 3.4% and 1.5% in patients treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 0.5% in patients who received placebo \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety data were evaluated in 60 patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 8), 161 patients aged 6 to 11 years \n(trials 6 and 7) and in 194 patients aged 12 to 17 years with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation and who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor in clinical studies. Patients aged 12 to 17 years were \nincluded in trials 1 and 2. \n \nThe safety profile in these paediatric patients is generally consistent with that in adult patients. \n \nLong-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 57 patients aged 2 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene were generally consistent with the \n24-week parent study in patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 8) and safety data in patients aged 6 to \n11 years. \n \nLong-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 239 patients aged 6 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (trial 9) were generally consistent \nwith the 24-week parent studies in patients aged 6 to 11 years (trial 6 and trial 7). \nDescription of selected adverse reactions for paediatric patients aged 2 to 11 years \nHepatobiliary adverse reactions \nDuring the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 58 patients aged 6 to 11 years (trial 6), the \nincidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN was 5.3%, 8.8%, \nand 19.3%. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor dosing was \nmaintained or successfully resumed after interruption in all patients with transaminase elevations, \nexcept 1 patient who discontinued treatment permanently. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study in 204 patients aged 6 to 11 years \n(trial 7), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN was \n1.0%, 4.9%, and 12.6% in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, and 2.0%, 3.0%, and 7.9% in the \nplacebo-treated patients. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Two patients in the \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor group and two patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment permanently \ndue to transaminase elevations. \n \nDuring the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 60 patients aged 2 through 5 years (trial 8), \nthe incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN was 8.3% \n(5/60), 11.7% (7/60), and 15.0% (9/60). No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Three \npatients discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment permanently due to transaminase elevations. \n \nRespiratory adverse reactions \nDuring the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study (trial 6) in 58 patients aged 6 to 11 years (mean \nbaseline ppFEV1 was 91.4), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 6.9% (4/58). \n \nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study (trial 7) in patients aged 6 to 11 years \n(mean baseline ppFEV1 was 89.8), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 18.4% in \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor patients and 12.9% in placebo patients. A decline in ppFEV1 at initiation of \ntherapy was observed during serial post dose spirometry assessments. The absolute change from pre-\ndose at 4 to 6 hours post-dose was -7.7 on day 1 and -1.3 on day 15 in lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients. \nThe post-dose decline was resolved by week 16. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose \nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. \n \nAdverse reactions that occurred at an increased incidence of ≥ 5% in the supratherapeutic dose period \ncompared with the therapeutic dose period were headache, generalised rash, and increased \ntransaminase. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products; ATC code: R07AX30 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. \nThe F508del mutation impacts the CFTR protein in multiple ways, primarily by causing a defect in \ncellular processing and trafficking that reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small \namount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface has low channel-open probability (defective \nchannel gating). Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector that acts directly on F508del-CFTR to improve its \ncellular processing and trafficking, thereby increasing the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell \nsurface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the \nchannel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46 \n\nlumacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, \nresulting in increased chloride ion transport. The exact mechanisms by which lumacaftor improves \ncellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR and ivacaftor potentiates F508del-CFTR are not \nknown. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEffects on sweat chloride \nChanges in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were \nevaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF aged 18 years \nand older. In this trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation) completed dosing with \nlumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an \nadditional 28 days, and 25 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for F508del) completed dosing with \nplacebo. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as \nmean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 28 was statistically significant at -8.2 mmol/L \n(95% CI: -14, -2). The treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor \n250 mg q12h and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 56 was \nstatistically significant at -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4). \n \nIn trial 7 (see Clinical efficacy and safety) in patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation \naged 6 to 11 years, the treatment difference (LS mean) in sweat chloride for the absolute change at \nweek 24 as compared to placebo was -24.9 mmol/L (nominal P < 0.0001). The treatment difference \n(LS mean) in sweat chloride for the average absolute change at day 15 and at week 4 as compared to \nplacebo was -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -23.4, -18.2; nominal P < 0.0001).  \n \nIn trial 8 in patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation aged 2 to 5 years, the mean absolute \nwithin-group change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 24 was -31.7 mmol/L (95% \nCI: -35.7, -27.6). In addition, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from week 24 at week 26 \nfollowing the 2-week washout period (to evaluate off-drug response) was an increase of 33.0 mmol/L \n(95% CI: 28.9, 37.1; nominal P < 0.0001), representing a return to baseline after treatment washout. At \nweek 24, 16% of children had a reduction in sweat chloride below 60 mmol/L, and none below \n30 mmol/L. \n \nChanges in FEV1 \nChanges in ppFEV1 in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were also \nevaluated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial in patients with CF aged 18 years and \nolder. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean \nabsolute change in ppFEV1 was -4.6 percentage points (95% CI: -9.6, 0.4) from baseline to day 28, 4.2 \npercentage points (95% CI: –1.3, 9.7) from baseline to day 56, and 7.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.6, \n12.8; statistically significant) from day 28 to day 56 (following the addition of ivacaftor to lumacaftor \nmonotherapy). \n \nDecrease in heart rate \nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, a maximum decrease in mean heart rate of \n6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed on day 1 and day 15 around 4 to 6 hours after \ndosing. After day 15, heart rate was not monitored in the period after dosing in these studies. From \nweek 4, the change in mean heart rate at pre-dose ranged from 1 to 2 bpm below baseline among \npatients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The percentage of patients with heart rate values < 50 bpm \non treatment was 11% for patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor, compared to 4.9% for patients \nwho received placebo. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nNo meaningful changes in QTc interval or blood pressure were observed in a thorough QT clinical \nstudy evaluating lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once \ndaily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nTrials in patients with CF aged 12 years and above who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in \nthe CFTR gene \nThe efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical \ntrials of 1,108 clinically stable patients with CF, in which 737 patients were randomised to and dosed \nwith lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Patients in both trials were randomised 1:1:1 to receive lumacaftor 600 mg \nonce daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, or placebo. \nPatients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF \ntherapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline). Patients from \nthese trials were eligible to roll over into a blinded extension study. \n \nTrial 1 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.1 years) with \npercent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.7 at baseline [range: \n31.1 to 94.0]). Trial 2 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 years) with \nppFEV1 at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.5 at baseline [range: 31.3 to 99.8]). Patients \nwith a history of colonisation with organisms such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, \nor Mycobacterium abscessus or who had 3 or more abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, AP, \nGGT ≥ 3 times the ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN) were excluded. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at \nweek 24. Other efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, absolute change \nfrom baseline in BMI, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the proportion of \npatients achieving ≥ 5% relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24, and the number of \npulmonary exacerbations (including those requiring hospitalisation or IV antibiotic therapy) through \nweek 24. \n \nIn both trials, treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant improvement in \nppFEV1 (Table 5). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was rapid in onset (day 15) and sustained \nthroughout the 24-week treatment period. At day 15, the treatment difference between lumacaftor \n400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from \nbaseline was 2.51 percentage points in the pooled trials 1 and 2 (P < 0.0001). Improvements in \nppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex and geographic region. The Phase 3 \ntrials of lumacaftor/ivacaftor included 81 patients with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline. The treatment \ndifference in this subgroup was comparable to that observed in patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 40. At \nweek 24, the treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo for \nthe mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from baseline in the pooled trials 1 and 2 were 3.39 \npercentage points (P = 0.0382) for patients with ppFEV1 < 40 and 2.47 percentage points (P < 0.0001) \nfor patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 40. \n \nTable 5: Summary of primary and key secondary outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2* \n\n Trial 1 Trial 2 Pooled (trial 1 and trial 2) \n\nPlacebo \n(n = 184) \n\nLUM 400 mg \nq12h/ IVA \n\n250 mg q12h \n(n = 182) \n\nPlacebo \n(n = 187) \n\nLUM 400 mg \nq12h/IVA \n\n250 mg q12h \n(n = 187) \n\nPlacebo \n(n = 371) \n\nLUM 400 mg \nq12h/IVA \n\n250 mg q12h \n(n = 369) \n\nAbsolute change in \nppFEV1 at week 24 \n(percentage points) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n2.41 \n(P = 0.0003) † – \n\n2.65 \n(P = 0.0011) † – \n\n2.55 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n-0.73 \n(P = 0.2168) \n\n1.68 \n(P = 0.0051) \n\n-0.02 \n(P = 0.9730) \n\n2.63 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n-0.39 \n(P < 0.3494) \n\n2.16 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nRelative change in \nppFEV1 at week 24 \n(%) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n4.15 \n(P = 0.0028)† – \n\n4.69 \n( P =0.0009)† – \n\n4.4 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n-0.85 \n(P = 0.3934) \n\n3.3 \n(P = 0.0011) \n\n0.16 \n(P = 0.8793) \n\n4.85 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n-0.34 \n(P = 0.6375) \n\n4.1 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nAbsolute change in \nBMI at week 24 \n(kg/m2) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n0.13 \n(P = 0.1938) – \n\n0.36 \n(P < 0.0001)† – \n\n0.24 \n(P = 0.0004) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n0.19 \n(P = 0.0065) \n\n0.32 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n0.07 \n(P = 0.2892) \n\n0.43 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n0.13 \n(P = 0.0066) \n\n0.37 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n\n\n48 \n\nAbsolute change in \nCFQ-R \nRespiratory \nDomain Score at \nweek 24 (points) \n\nTreatment \ndifference – \n\n1.5 \n(P = 0.3569) – \n\n2.9 \n(P = 0.0736) – \n\n2.2 \n(P = 0.0512) \n\nWithin-group \nchange \n\n1.1 \n(P = 0.3423) \n\n2.6 \n(P = 0.0295) \n\n2.8 \n(P = 0.0152) \n\n5.7 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\n1.9 \n(P = 0.0213) \n\n4.1 \n(P < 0.0001) \n\nProportion of \npatients with ≥5% \nrelative change in \nppFEV1 at week 24 \n\n% 25% 32% 26% 41% 26% 37% \n\nOdds ratio – 1.43 (P = 0.1208) – \n1.90 \n\n(P = 0.0032) – \n1.66 \n\n(P = 0.0013) \n\nNumber of \npulmonary \nexacerbations \nthrough week 24 \n\n# of events \n(rate per 48 \n\nwks) \n112 (1.07) 73 (0.71) 139 (1.18) 79 (0.67) 251 (1.14) 152 (0.70) \n\nRate ratio – 0.66 (P = 0.0169) – \n0.57 \n\n(P = 0.0002) – \n0.61 \n\n(P < 0.0001) \n\n* In each study, a hierarchical testing procedure was performed within each active treatment arm for primary and secondary \nendpoints vs. placebo; at each step, P ≤ 0.0250 and all previous tests also meeting this level of significance was required for \nstatistical significance. \n\n† Indicates statistical significance confirmed in the hierarchical testing procedure. \n \nAt week 24, the proportion of patients who remained free from pulmonary exacerbations was \nsignificantly higher for patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor compared with placebo. In the \npooled analysis, the rate ratio of exacerbations through week 24 in subjects treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor (lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; n = 369) was 0.61 (P < 0.0001), \nrepresenting a reduction of 39% relative to placebo. The event rate per year, annualised to 48 weeks, \nwas 0.70 in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and 1.14 in the placebo group. Treatment with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor significantly decreased the risk for exacerbations requiring hospitalisation versus \nplacebo by 61% (rate ratio = 0.39, P < 0.0001; event rate per 48 weeks 0.17 for lumacaftor/ivacaftor \nand 0.45 for placebo) and reduced exacerbations requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics by \n56% (rate ratio = 0.44, P < 0.0001; event rate per 48 weeks 0.25 for lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 0.58 for \nplacebo). These results were not considered statistically significant within the framework of the testing \nhierarchy for the individual studies. \n \nLong-term safety and efficacy rollover trial \nTrial 3 was a Phase 3, parallel-group, multicentre, rollover extension study in patients with CF that \nincluded patients aged 12 years and older from trial 1 and trial 2. This extension trial was designed to \nevaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 1,108 patients \nwho received any treatment in trial 1 or trial 2, 1,029 (93%) were dosed and received active treatment \n(lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h or lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor \n250 mg q12h) in trial 3 for up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e., up to a total of 120 weeks). The primary \nefficacy analysis of this extension study included data up to week 72 of trial 3 with a sensitivity \nanalysis that included data up to week 96 of trial 3.  \n \nPatients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 1 or trial 2 showed an effect that was maintained with \nrespect to baseline after an additional 96 weeks through trial 3. For patients who transitioned from \nplacebo to active treatment similar changes as those observed in patients treated with \nlumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 1 or trial 2 were seen (see Table 5).

This extension trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy \nof long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 262 patients who received any treatment in \ntrial 6 or trial 7, 239 (91%) were dosed and received active treatment (patients 6 to <12 years of age \nreceived lumacaftor 200 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; patients ≥12 years of age received \nlumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) in the extension study for up to an additional \n96 weeks (i.e., up to a total of 120 weeks) (see section 4.8).

Three of the 48 patients who had faecal elastase-1 values < 100 µg/g \n\nat baseline achieved a level of ≥ 200 µg/g at week 24. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOrkambi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe exposure (AUC) of lumacaftor is approximately 2-fold higher in healthy adult volunteers \ncompared to exposure in patients with CF. The exposure of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult \nvolunteers and patients with CF. After twice-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of \nlumacaftor and ivacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after approximately 7 days of \ntreatment, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.9 for lumacaftor. The steady-state exposure \nof ivacaftor is lower than that of day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nAfter oral administration of lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in a fed state, the \nsteady-state mean (± SD) for AUC0-12h and Cmax were 198 (64.8) µg∙h/mL and 25.0 (7.96) µg/mL for \nlumacaftor, respectively, and 3.66 (2.25) µg∙h/mL and 0.602 (0.304) µg/mL for ivacaftor, respectively. \nAfter oral administration of ivacaftor alone as 150 mg q12h in a fed state, the steady-state mean (± SD) \nfor AUC0-12h and Cmax were 9.08 (3.20) µg∙h/mL and 1.12 (0.319) µg/mL, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nAbsorption \n \nFollowing multiple oral doses of lumacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased \nproportional to dose over the range of 50 mg to 1000 mg every 24 hours. The exposure of lumacaftor \nincreased approximately 2.0-fold when given with fat-containing food relative to fasted conditions. \nThe median (range) tmax of lumacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 9.0) in the fed state. \n \nFollowing multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure \nof ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg every 12 hours. The \nexposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor increased approximately 3-fold \nwhen given with fat-containing food in healthy volunteers. Therefore, lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be \nadministered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax of ivacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours \n(2.0; 6.0) in the fed state. \n \nDistribution \n \nLumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. After oral \nadministration of 400 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in a fed state, the typical apparent \nvolumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments [coefficient of variation as a \npercentage (CV)] were estimated to be 23.5 L (48.7%) and 33.3 L (30.5%), respectively. \n \nIvacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and \nalbumin. After oral administration of ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours in combination with lumacaftor, \nthe typical apparent volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments (CV) were \nestimated to be 95.0 L (53.9%) and 201 L (26.6%), respectively. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that lumacaftor is a substrate of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLumacaftor is not extensively metabolised in humans, with the majority of lumacaftor excreted \nunchanged in the faeces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolised via \noxidation and glucuronidation. \n \nIvacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. \nM1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. \nM6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted unchanged \nin the faeces. There was negligible urinary excretion of lumacaftor as unchanged drug. The apparent \nterminal half-life is approximately 26 hours. The typical apparent clearance, CL/F (CV), of lumacaftor \nwas estimated to be 2.38 L/h (29.4%) for patients with CF. \n \nFollowing oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the \nfaeces after metabolic conversion. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged \ndrug. In healthy subjects, the half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is approximately \n9 hours. The typical CL/F (CV) of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor was estimated \nto be 25.1 L/h (40.5%) for patients with CF. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nFollowing multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired \nhepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had higher exposures (AUC0-12h by approximately \n\n\n\n55 \n\n50% and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. The \nimpact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) on pharmacokinetics of \nlumacaftor given in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in exposure is \nexpected to be less than 50%. \n \nStudies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, \nscore 10 to 15), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with renal \nimpairment. In a human pharmacokinetic study with lumacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination \nof lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine \nwith 0.18% as unchanged parent). In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was \nminimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was \nrecovered in the urine). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of clearance versus creatinine \nclearance shows no trend for subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 65 years or older have not been \nevaluated. \n \nGender \nThe effect of gender on lumacaftor pharmacokinetics was evaluated using a population \npharmacokinetics analysis of data from clinical studies of lumacaftor given in combination with \nivacaftor. Results indicate no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters for \nlumacaftor or ivacaftor between males and females. No dose adjustments are necessary based on \ngender. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe exposures are similar between adults and the paediatric population based on population (PK) \nanalyses as presented in Table 10. \n \nTable 10: Mean (SD) lumacaftor and ivacaftor exposure by age group \n\nAge group Dose \n\nMean \nlumacaftor \n\n(SD) \nAUCss \n\n(μg/mL*h) \n\nMean ivacaftor \n(SD) \n\nAUCss \n(μg/mL*h) \n\nPatients aged 2 to 5 years \nand weighing and less than \n14 kg \n\nlumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor \n125 mg sachet every 12 hours \n\n180 (45.5) 5.92 (4.61) \nPatients aged 2 to 5 years \nand weighing 14 kg or \ngreater \n\nlumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor \n188 mg sachet every 12 hours \n\n217 (48.6) 5.90 (1.93) \nPatients aged 6 to 11 years lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor \n\n250 mg every 12 hours  203 (57.4) 5.26 (3.08) \nPatients aged 12 to less than \n18 years  \n\nlumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor \n250 mg every 12 hours  241 (61.4) 3.90 (1.56) \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLumacaftor \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \n\n\n\n56 \n\nreproduction and development. Specific studies to evaluate the phototoxic potential of lumacaftor were \nnot conducted; however, evaluation of the available non-clinical and clinical data suggests no \nphototoxic liability. \n \nIvacaftor \n \nEffects in repeated dose studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess \n(> 25-, > 45-, and > 35-fold for mice, rats, and dogs, respectively) of the maximum human exposure of \nivacaftor when administered as Orkambi, indicating little relevance to clinical use. Non-clinical data \nreveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity and carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nSafety pharmacology \nIvacaftor produced concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on hERG (human ether-à-go-go related \ngene) tail currents, with an IC15 of 5.5 µM, compared to the Cmax (1.5 µM) for ivacaftor at the \ntherapeutic dose for lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, no ivacaftor-induced QT prolongation was \nobserved in a dog telemetry study at single doses up to 60 mg/kg or in ECG measurements from \nrepeat-dose studies of up to 1 year duration at the 60 mg/kg/day dose level in dogs (Cmax after \n365 days = 36.2 to 47.6 μM). Ivacaftor produced a dose-related but transient increase in the blood \npressure parameters in dogs at single oral doses up to 60 mg/kg (see section 5.1).  \n \nPregnancy and fertility \nIvacaftor was not teratogenic when dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the organogenesis \nstage of foetal development at doses approximately 7 times (ivacaftor and metabolite exposure) and \n46 times the ivacaftor exposure in humans at the therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor dose, respectively. \nAt maternally toxic doses in rats, ivacaftor produced reductions in foetal body weight; an increase in \nthe incidence of variations in cervical ribs, hypoplastic ribs, and wavy ribs; and sternal irregularities, \nincluding fusions. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. \n \nIvacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at \n200 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 11 and 7 times, respectively, those obtained with \nthe maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed \nAUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 150 mg/kg/day in the \n6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the pilot embryofoetal \ndevelopment study in this species) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. No \neffects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at \n≤ 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 8 and 5 times, respectively, those obtained with \nthe maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed \nAUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 100 mg/kg/day in the \n6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the embryofoetal development \nstudy in this species). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nPeri- and post-natal development \nIvacaftor did not cause developmental defects in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally from \npregnancy through parturition and weaning at 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures that were \napproximately 4 times those obtained with the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor \ncomponent of Orkambi based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Doses above \n100 mg/kg/day resulted in survival and lactation indices that were 92% and 98% of control values, \nrespectively, as well as reductions in pup body weights. \n \nJuvenile animals \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed with ivacaftor at 0.32 times the maximum \nrecommended human dose based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when \nco-administered with lumacaftor as Orkambi. Cataracts were not observed in foetuses derived from rat \ndams treated during the organogenesis stage of foetal development, in rat pups exposed to a certain \nextent through milk ingestion prior to weaning, or in repeated dose toxicity studies with ivacaftor. The \npotential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \nLumacaftor and ivacaftor \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies involving the co-administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor revealed no \nspecial hazard for humans in terms of potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicities. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Orkambi \n3. How to take Orkambi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Orkambi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Orkambi is and what it is used for \n \nOrkambi contains two active substances, lumacaftor and ivacaftor. It is a medicine used for long-term \ntreatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have a specific change (called \nF508del mutation) affecting the gene for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance \nregulator (CFTR), which plays an important role in regulating the flow of mucus in the lungs. People \nwith the mutation will produce an abnormal CFTR protein. Cells contain two copies of the CFTR \ngene; Orkambi is used in patients in whom both copies are affected by the F508del mutation \n(homozygotes). \n \nLumacaftor and ivacaftor work together to improve the function of the abnormal CFTR protein. \nLumacaftor increases the amount of CFTR available and ivacaftor helps the abnormal protein to work \nmore normally.  \n \nOrkambi may help your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also notice  that it is \neasier to gain weight. \n. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Orkambi \n \nDo not take Orkambi \n• if you are allergic to lumacaftor, ivacaftor, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Orkambi. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nOrkambi should not be used in patients other than those who have two copies of the F508del \nmutation in their CFTR gene. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Orkambi if you have been told you have liver or kidney disease as \nyour doctor may need to adjust the dose of Orkambi. \n \nAbnormal blood tests of the liver have been commonly seen in some people receiving Orkambi. Tell \nyour doctor straight away if you have any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems: \n• Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area \n• Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes \n• Loss of appetite \n• Nausea or vomiting \n• Dark urine \n• Confusion \n \nYour doctor should do some blood tests to check your liver before and while you are taking Orkambi, \nparticularly during the first year. \n \nRespiratory events such as shortness of breath or chest tightness or narrowing of the airways were \nseen in patients when starting Orkambi, especially in patients who have poor lung function. If you \nhave poor lung function your doctor may monitor you more closely when you start Orkambi. \n \nAn increase in blood pressure has been seen in some patients treated with Orkambi. Your doctor may \nmonitor your blood pressure during treatment with Orkambi. \n \nAbnormality of the lens of the eye (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some \nchildren and adolescents treated with Orkambi and ivacaftor alone (one of the components of \nOrkambi).Your doctor may perform some eye examinations prior to and during treatment with \nOrkambi.  \n \nOrkambi is not recommended in patients who have undergone an organ transplant. \n \nChildren under 6 years old \nOrkambi tablets should not be used in children under the age of 6 years. Other forms of this medicine \n(granules in a sachet) are more suitable for children under 6 years of age, ask your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nOther medicines and Orkambi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nEspecially tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: \n \n• Antibiotic medicines (used for the treatment of bacterial infections) for example: \n\ntelithromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, erythromycin \n \n• Anticonvulsant medicines (used for the treatment of fits [epileptic seizures]) for example: \n\nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin \n \n• Benzodiazepines (used for the treatment of anxiety or sleeplessness [insomnia], agitation, etc.) \n\nfor example:midazolam, triazolam \n \n• Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections) for example: \n\nfluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n• Immunosuppressants (used after an organ transplantation) for example: \nciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus \n\n \n• Herbal medicines, for example: \n\nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \n• Anti-allergic medicines (used for the treatment of allergies and/or asthma) for example: \n\nmontelukast, fexofenadine \n \n• Antidepressant medicines (used for the treatment of depression) for example: \n\ncitalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion \n \n• Anti-inflammatory medicines (used for the treatment of inflammation) for example: \n\nibuprofen \n \n• H2 Antagonist medicines (used to reduce stomach acid) for example: \n\nranitidine \n \n• Cardiac glycosides (used for the treatment of mild to moderate congestive heart failure and an \n\nabnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation) for example: \ndigoxin \n\n \n• Anticoagulants (used to prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger in blood and blood \n\nvessels) for example: \nwarfarin, dabigatran \n\n \n• Contraceptive medicines (used for the prevention of pregnancy): \n\noral, injectable, and implantable contraceptives as well as contraceptive skin patches; that may \ninclude ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, and other progestogens. These should not be relied \nupon as an effective method of birth control when given with Orkambi \n\n \n• Corticosteroid medicines (used to treat inflammation): \n\nmethylprednisolone, prednisone \n \n• Proton pump inhibitor medicines (used to treat acid reflux disease and ulcers): \n\nomeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole \n \n• Oral hypoglycaemics (used for the management of type 2 diabetes):  \n\nrepaglinide \n \nThere have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC - an \nactive component in cannabis) in patients receiving Orkambi. Your doctor may request another test to \nverify results. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Orkambi during \npregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. \n \nIt is unknown if lumacaftor or ivacaftor are found in human milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your \ndoctor for advice before taking Orkambi. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop \nbreast-feeding or for you to stop lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you. \n \n\n\n\n90 \n\nDriving and using machines \nDizziness has been reported in patients receiving ivacaftor, a component of Orkambi, which could \ninfluence the ability to drive or use machines.

Check your child has \nbeen given the right dose (below). \n \n\nAge, weight Product Dose \n2 to 5 years and \nweighing less than \n14 kg \n\nOrkambi 100 mg/125 mg granules in \nsachet \n\nOne sachet in the morning; \nOne sachet in the evening \n\n2 to 5 years and \nweighing 14 kg or \ngreater  \n\nOrkambi 150 mg/188 mg granules in \nsachet \n\nOne sachet in the morning; \nOne sachet in the evening \n\n \nIf your child has moderate or severe problems with liver function, your child’s doctor may need to \nreduce the dose of Orkambi as your child’s liver will not clear Orkambi as fast as in children who have \nnormal liver function. \n• Moderate liver problems: the dose may be reduced on alternate days: two sachets on one day \n\n(morning and evening), one sachet the next (morning only). \n• Severe liver problems: the dose may be reduced to one sachet per day, or less often. \n \nMethod of administration \nOrkambi is for oral use.  \n \nEach sachet is for single use only. \n \nYou may start giving your child Orkambi on any day of the week. \n \nGiving Orkambi granules to your child: \n• Hold sachet of granules with cut line on top. \n• Shake sachet gently to settle contents. \n• Tear or cut sachet open along the line. \n• Mix the entire contents of a sachet with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or \n\nliquid. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. Some examples of age-\nappropriate soft foods and liquids include puréed fruits, flavoured yogurt, and milk or juice. \n\n• Once mixed, give the product to your child immediately. If this is not possible, give it within the \nhour after mixing. Make sure that the mixture is consumed immediately and completely. \n\n• Food containing fat should be given to your child just before or just after dosing (some \nexamples are provided below). \n\n \nTaking Orkambi with fat-containing food is important to get the right levels of medicine in the \nbody. Meals and snacks recommended in CF guidelines or meals recommended in standard nutritional \nguidelines contain adequate amounts of fat. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those \nprepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs. Examples of other fat-containing foods are: \n• Cheese, whole milk, whole-milk dairy products \n• Meats, oily fish \n• Avocados, hummus, soy-based products (tofu) \n\n\n\n98 \n\n• Nutritional bars or drinks \n \nIf your child takes more Orkambi than he/she should \nContact your child’s doctor or pharmacist for advice. If possible, have your child’s medicine and this \nleaflet with you. Your child may experience side effects, including those mentioned in section 4 \nbelow. \n \nIf you forget to give your child Orkambi \nGive the missed dose with fat-containing food if less than 6 hours have passed since the time your \nchild missed the dose. Otherwise, wait until your child’s next scheduled dose as you normally would. \nDo not give your child a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop giving your child Orkambi \nGive Orkambi to your child for as long as your child’s doctor recommends. Do not stop unless your \nchild’s doctor advises you to. You should keep giving the medicine as the doctor directs even if the \nchild feels well. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Given that this \nstudy is categorised as a category 1 and the results are considered key to benefit risk it is \nconsidered appropriate to have a second renewal of the marketing authorisation. \n\n• There is limited exposure and post-marketing data available for the recent approvals in \npaediatric patients (6-12 years and 2-5 years of age). \n\n• There is a planned PAES study to compare disease progression among children with CF \nhomozygous for F508del-CFTR and aged 2 through 5 years at the time of Orkambi treatment \ninitiation versus disease progression among concurrent matched cohort of children with CF \nwho have never received Orkambi treatment, in addition to a longitudinal historical cohort. \nThis study is expected to provide verification of the impact of Orkambi treatment on clinical \noutcomes (including long term safety) and disease progression and to confirm current efficacy \nand safety assumptions.  \n\n•  \nTherefore, based upon the limited safety profile of Orkambi, the CHMP concluded that the MAH \nshould submit one additional renewal application in 5 years’ time. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
