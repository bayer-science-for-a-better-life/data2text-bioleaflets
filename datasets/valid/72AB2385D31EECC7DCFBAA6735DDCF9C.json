CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nEucreas is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: \n\n- Eucreas is indicated in the treatment of adult patients who are unable to achieve sufficient \nglycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral metformin alone or who are already \n\ntreated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets. \n\n- Eucreas is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e. triple combination therapy) as an \nadjunct to diet and exercise in adult patients inadequately controlled with metformin and a \n\nsulphonylurea. \n\n- Eucreas is indicated in triple combination therapy with insulin as an adjunct to diet and exercise \nto improve glycaemic control in adult patients when insulin at a stable dose and metformin \n\nalone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults with normal renal function (GFR \u2265 90 ml/min) \n\nThe dose of antihyperglycaemic therapy with Eucreas should be individualised on the basis of the \n\npatient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum \n\nrecommended daily dose of 100 mg vildagliptin. Eucreas may be initiated at either the 50 mg/850 mg \n\nor 50 mg/1000 mg tablet strength twice daily, one tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. \n\n \n\n- For patients inadequately controlled at their maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy: \n\nThe starting dose of Eucreas should provide vildagliptin as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily \n\ndose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken. \n\n \n\n- For patients switching from co-administration of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets: \n\nEucreas should be initiated at the dose of vildagliptin and metformin already being taken. \n\n \n\n- For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea: \n\nThe doses of Eucreas should provide vildagliptin as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a \n\ndose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Eucreas is used in combination with \n\na sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered to reduce the risk of \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\n- For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with insulin and the maximal \n\ntolerated dose of metformin: \n\nThe dose of Eucreas should provide vildagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) \n\nand a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of vildagliptin and metformin as triple oral therapy in combination with a \n\nthiazolidinedione have not been established. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \n\nAs metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal \n\nfunction, elderly patients taking Eucreas should have their renal function monitored regularly (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin-containing products and at \n\nleast annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in \n\nthe elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months. \n\n \n\nThe maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that \n\nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering \n\ninitiation of metformin in patients with GFR<60 ml/min. \n\n \n\nIf no adequate strength of Eucreas is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead of \n\nthe fixed dose combination. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nGFR ml/min Metformin Vildagliptin \n\n60-89 Maximum daily dose is 3000 mg. \n\nDose reduction may be considered in \n\nrelation to declining renal function. \n\nNo dose adjustment. \n\n45-59 Maximum daily dose is 2000 mg. \n\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \n\nmaximum dose. \n\nMaximal daily dose is 50 mg. \n\n30-44 Maximum daily dose is 1000 mg. \n\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \n\nmaximum dose. \n\n<30 Metformin is contraindicated. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nEucreas should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including those with pre-treatment \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3 times the upper limit of \n\nnormal (ULN) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nEucreas is not recommended for use in children and adolescents (< 18 years). The safety and efficacy \n\nof Eucreas in children and adolescents (< 18 years) have not been established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\nTaking Eucreas with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \n\nmetformin (see also section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf02d Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\n\uf02d Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis) \n\n\uf02d Diabetic pre-coma \n\n\uf02d Severe renal failure (GFR < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.4) \n\n\uf02d Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function, such as: \n- dehydration, \n- severe infection, \n- shock, \n- intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4). \n\n\uf02d Acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia, such as: \n- cardiac or respiratory failure, \n- recent myocardial infarction, \n- shock. \n\n\uf02d Hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8) \n\n\uf02d Acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism \n\n\uf02d Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nEucreas is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients and should not be used in patients \n\nwith type 1 diabetes. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nLactic acidosis \n\n \n\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \n\nof renal function, or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \n\nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. \n\n \n\nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should \n\nbe temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \n\nNSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic \n\nacidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, \n\nprolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal \n\nproducts that may cause lactic acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \n\ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia \n\nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek \n\nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \n\nincreased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/l) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. \n\n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agents \n\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast-induced nephropathy, \n\nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be \n\ndiscontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \n\nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter (see section 4.2). \n\nMetformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR < 30 ml/min and should be temporarily \n\ndiscontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment, including those with pre-treatment ALT or AST > 3x ULN, should \n\nnot be treated with Eucreas (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nLiver enzyme monitoring \n\nRare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported with vildagliptin. In these \n\ncases, the patients were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function tests \n\n(LFTs) returned to normal after discontinuation of treatment. LFTs should be performed prior to the \n\ninitiation of treatment with Eucreas in order to know the patient\u2019s baseline value. Liver function \n\nshould be monitored during treatment with Eucreas at three-month intervals during the first year and \n\nperiodically thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a \n\nsecond liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent LFTs \n\nuntil the abnormality(ies) return(s) to normal. Should an increase in AST or in ALT of 3x ULN or \n\ngreater persist, withdrawal of Eucreas therapy is recommended. Patients who develop jaundice or \n\nother signs suggestive of liver dysfunction should discontinue Eucreas. \n\n \n\nFollowing withdrawal of treatment with Eucreas and LFT normalisation, treatment with Eucreas \n\nshould not be re-initiated. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSkin disorders \n\n \n\nSkin lesions, including blistering and ulceration have been reported with vildagliptin in extremities of \n\nmonkeys in non-clinical toxicology studies (see section 5.3). Although skin lesions were not observed \n\nat an increased incidence in clinical trials, there was limited experience in patients with diabetic skin \n\ncomplications. Furthermore, there have been post-marketing reports of bullous and exfoliative skin \n\nlesions. Therefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, \n\nsuch as blistering or ulceration, is recommended. \n\n \n\nAcute pancreatitis \n\n \n\nUse of vildagliptin has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients should be \n\ninformed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis. \n\n \n\nIf pancreatitis is suspected, vildagliptin should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \n\nvildagliptin should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of acute \n\npancreatitis. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\n \n\nSulphonylureas are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients receiving vildagliptin in combination \n\nwith a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of sulphonylurea may \n\nbe considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nSurgery \n\n \n\nMetformin must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. \n\nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition \n\nand provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThere have been no formal interaction studies for Eucreas. The following statements reflect the \n\ninformation available on the individual active substances. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin \n\n \n\nVildagliptin has a low potential for interactions with co-administered medicinal products. Since \n\nvildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate and does not inhibit or induce CYP \n\n450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with active substances that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers \n\nof these enzymes. \n\n \n\nResults from clinical trials conducted with the oral antidiabetics pioglitazone, metformin and \n\nglyburide in combination with vildagliptin have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic \n\ninteractions in the target population. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction studies with digoxin (P-glycoprotein substrate) and warfarin (CYP2C9 \n\nsubstrate) in healthy subjects have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions after co-\n\nadministration with vildagliptin. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan \n\nand simvastatin. In these studies, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed \n\nafter co-administration with vildagliptin. However, this has not been established in the target \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCombination with ACE inhibitors \n\nThere may be an increased risk of angioedema in patients concomitantly taking ACE inhibitors.(see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the hypoglycaemic effect of vildagliptin may be \n\nreduced by certain active substances, including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products and \n\nsympathomimetics. \n\n \n\nMetformin \n\n \n\nCombinations not recommended \n\nAlcohol \n\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of \n\nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nIodinated contrast agents \n\nMetformin must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until \n\nat least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nCationic active substances \n\nCationic active substances that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may interact \n\nwith metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems and hence delay the \n\nelimination of metformin, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis. A study in healthy volunteers \n\nshowed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased metformin systemic exposure \n\n(AUC) by 50%. Therefore, close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the \n\nrecommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when cationic \n\nmedicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion are co-administered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCombinations requiring precautions for use \n\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \n\nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \n\nproducts in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. \n\n \n\nGlucocorticoids, beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity. The patient \n\nshould be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring performed, especially at the \n\nbeginning of treatment. If necessary, the dosage of Eucreas may need to be adjusted during \n\nconcomitant therapy and on its discontinuation. \n\n \n\nAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels. If necessary, \n\nthe dosage of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the \n\nother medicinal product and on its discontinuation. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Eucreas in pregnant women. For vildagliptin studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses. For metformin, studies in animals have not \n\nshown reproductive toxicity. Studies in animals performed with vildagliptin and metformin have not \n\nshown evidence of teratogenicity, but foetotoxic effects at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). The \n\npotential risk for humans is unknown. Eucreas should not be used during pregnancy. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown excretion of both metformin and vildagliptin in milk. It is unknown \n\nwhether vildagliptin is excreted in human milk, but metformin is excreted in human milk in low \n\namounts. Due to both the potential risk of neonate hypoglycaemia related to metformin and the lack of \n\nhuman data with vildagliptin, Eucreas should not be used during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n \n\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for Eucreas (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients who \n\nmay experience dizziness as an adverse reaction should avoid driving vehicles or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nThere have been no therapeutic clinical trials conducted with Eucreas. However, bioequivalence of \n\nEucreas with co-administered vildagliptin and metformin has been demonstrated (see section 5.2). The \n\ndata presented here relate to the co-administration of vildagliptin and metformin, where vildagliptin \n\nhas been added to metformin. There have been no studies of metformin added to vildagliptin. \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe majority of adverse reactions were mild and transient, not requiring treatment discontinuations. \n\nNo association was found between adverse reactions and age, ethnicity, duration of exposure or daily \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nRare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported with vildagliptin. In these \n\ncases, the patients were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function returned \n\nto normal after discontinuation of treatment. In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy \n\ntrials of up to 24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations \u2265 3x ULN (classified as \n\npresent on at least 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and \n\n0.2% for vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, \n\nrespectively. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, non-progressive in \n\nnature and not associated with cholestasis or jaundice. \n\n \n\nRare cases of angioedema have been reported on vildagliptin at a similar rate to controls. A greater \n\nproportion of cases were reported when vildagliptin was administered in combination with an ACE \n\ninhibitor. The majority of events were mild in severity and resolved with ongoing vildagliptin \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions reported in patients who received vildagliptin in double-blind studies as \n\nmonotherapy and add-on therapies are listed below by system organ class and absolute frequency. \n\nAdverse reactions listed in Table 5 are based on information available from the metformin Summary \n\nof Product Characteristics available in the EU. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10); \n\ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported in patients who received vildagliptin 100 mg daily as \n\nadd-on therapy to metformin compared to placebo plus metformin in double-blind \n\nstudies (N=208) \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Common Hypoglycaemia \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Tremor \n\n Common Headache \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Fatigue \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Nausea \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nIn controlled clinical trials with the combination of vildagliptin 100 mg daily plus metformin, no \n\nwithdrawal due to adverse reactions was reported in either the vildagliptin 100 mg daily plus \n\nmetformin or the placebo plus metformin treatment groups. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was common in patients receiving vildagliptin in \n\ncombination with metformin (1%) and uncommon in patients receiving placebo + metformin (0.4%). \n\nNo severe hypoglycaemic events were reported in the vildagliptin arms. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, weight did not change from baseline when vildagliptin 100 mg daily was added to \n\nmetformin (+0.2 kg and -1.0 kg for vildagliptin and placebo, respectively). \n\n \n\nClinical trials of up to more than 2 years\u2019 duration did not show any additional safety signals or \n\nunforeseen risks when vildagliptin was added on to metformin. \n\n \n\nCombination with a sulphonylurea \n\n \n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions reported in patients who received vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily in \n\ncombination with metformin and a sulphonylurea (N=157) \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutritional disorders \n\n Common Hypoglycaemia \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Dizziness, tremor \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common Hyperhidrosis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common Asthenia \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nThere were no withdrawals due to adverse reactions reported in the vildagliptin + metformin + \n\nglimepiride treatment group versus 0.6% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of hypoglycaemia was common in both treatment groups (5.1% for the vildagliptin + \n\nmetformin + glimepiride group versus 1.9% for the placebo + metformin + glimepiride group).

Consideration of such aetiology is recommended if a \n\npatient presents with megaloblastic anaemia. \n\n**Isolated cases of liver function test abnormalities or hepatitis resolving upon metformin \n\ndiscontinuation have been reported. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve \n\nspontaneously in most cases. To prevent them, it is recommended that metformin be taken in 2 daily \n\ndoses during or after meals. A slow increase in the dose may also improve gastrointestinal tolerability. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nTable 6 Post-marketing adverse reactions \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n Not known Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n Not known Hepatitis (reversible upon discontinuation of the medicinal product) \n\nAbnormal liver function tests (reversible upon discontinuation of the \n\nmedicinal product) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Not known Myalgia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Not known Urticaria \n\nExfoliative and bullous skin lesions, including bullous pemphigoid \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo data are available with regard to overdose of Eucreas. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin \n\n \n\nInformation regarding overdose with vildagliptin is limited. \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInformation on the likely symptoms of overdose with vildagliptin was taken from a rising dose \n\ntolerability study in healthy subjects given vildagliptin for 10 days. At 400 mg, there were three cases \n\nof muscle pain, and individual cases of mild and transient paraesthesia, fever, oedema and a transient \n\nincrease in lipase levels. At 600 mg, one subject experienced oedema of the feet and hands, and \n\nincreases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), AST, C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin levels. \n\nThree other subjects experienced oedema of the feet, with paraesthesia in two cases. All symptoms \n\nand laboratory abnormalities resolved without treatment after discontinuation of the study medicinal \n\nproduct. \n\n \n\nMetformin \n\n \n\nA large overdose of metformin (or co-existing risk of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis, \n\nwhich is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThe most effective method of removing metformin is haemodialysis. However, vildagliptin cannot be \n\nremoved by haemodialysis, although the major hydrolysis metabolite (LAY 151) can. Supportive \n\nmanagement is recommended. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \n\ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD08 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nEucreas combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action to \n\nimprove glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: vildagliptin, a member of the islet \n\nenhancer class, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin, a member of the islet enhancer class, is a potent and selective dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 \n\n(DPP-4) inhibitor. Metformin acts primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nVildagliptin \n\nVildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the \n\nincretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic \n\npolypeptide). \n\n \n\nThe administration of vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting \n\nin increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nBy increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity \n\nof beta cells to glucose, resulting in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with \n\nvildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta \n\ncell function including HOMA-\uf062 (Homeostasis Model Assessment\u2013\uf062), proinsulin to insulin ratio and \n\nmeasures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test. In non-diabetic \n\n(normal glycaemic) individuals, vildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or reduce glucose \n\nlevels. \n\n \n\nBy increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels, vildagliptin also enhances the sensitivity of alpha cells to \n\nglucose, resulting in more glucose-appropriate glucagon secretion. \n\n \n\nThe enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin \n\nhormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to \n\nreduced glycaemia. \n\n \n\nThe known effect of increased GLP-1 levels delaying gastric emptying is not observed with \n\nvildagliptin treatment. \n\n \n\nMetformin \n\nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \n\nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia \n\nor increased weight gain. \n\n \n\nMetformin may exert its glucose-lowering effect via three mechanisms: \n\n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production through inhibition of gluconeogenesis and \nglycogenolysis; \n\n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \nutilisation; \n\n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase and increases \n\nthe transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4). \n\n \n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \n\nmetabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \n\nclinical studies: metformin reduces serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and \n\ntriglycerides. \n\n \n\nThe prospective randomised UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) study has established the long-\n\nterm benefit of intensive blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the results for \n\noverweight patients treated with metformin after failure of diet alone showed: \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \n\np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n\n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034; \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017; \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin \n13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.011), and \n\nversus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-\n\nyears (p=0.021); \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin \n11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.01). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nVildagliptin added to patients whose glycaemic control was not satisfactory despite treatment with \n\nmetformin monotherapy resulted after 6-month treatment in additional statistically significant mean \n\nreductions in HbA1c compared to placebo (between group differences of -0.7% to -1.1% for \n\nvildagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg, respectively). The proportion of patients who achieved a decrease in \n\nHbA1c of \u2265 0.7% from baseline was statistically significantly higher in both vildagliptin plus \n\nmetformin groups (46% and 60%, respectively) versus the metformin plus placebo group (20%). \n\n \n\nIn a 24-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to pioglitazone (30 mg once daily) \n\nin patients inadequately controlled with metformin (mean daily dose: 2020 mg). Mean reductions from \n\nbaseline HbA1c of 8.4% were -0.9% with vildagliptin added to metformin and -1.0% with pioglitazone \n\nadded to metformin. A mean weight gain of +1.9 kg was observed in patients receiving pioglitazone \n\nadded to metformin compared to +0.3 kg in those receiving vildagliptin added to metformin. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial of 2 years\u2019 duration, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to glimepiride \n\n(up to 6 mg/day \u2013 mean dose at 2 years: 4.6 mg) in patients treated with metformin (mean daily dose: \n\n1894 mg). After 1 year mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.4% with vildagliptin added to metformin \n\nand -0.5% with glimepiride added to metformin, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.3%. Body weight \n\nchange with vildagliptin was -0.2 kg vs +1.6 kg with glimepiride. The incidence of hypoglycaemia \n\nwas significantly lower in the vildagliptin group (1.7%) than in the glimepiride group (16.2%). At \n\nstudy endpoint (2 years), the HbA1c was similar to baseline values in both treatment groups and the \n\nbody weight changes and hypoglycaemia differences were maintained. \n\n \n\nIn a 52-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to gliclazide (mean daily dose: \n\n229.5 mg) in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (metformin dose at baseline \n\n1928 mg/day). After 1 year, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.81% with vildagliptin added to \n\nmetformin (mean baseline HbA1c 8.4%) and -0.85% with gliclazide added to metformin (mean \n\nbaseline HbA1c 8.5%); statistical non-inferiority was achieved (95% CI -0.11 \u2013 0.20). Body weight \n\nchange with vildagliptin was +0.1 kg compared to a weight gain of +1.4 kg with gliclazide. \n\n \n\nIn a 24-week trial the efficacy of the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin and metformin (gradually \n\ntitrated to a dose of 50 mg/500 mg twice daily or 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily) as initial therapy in \n\ndrug-na\u00efve patients was evaluated. Vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily reduced HbA1c \n\nby -1.82% ,vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/500 mg twice daily by -1.61%, metformin 1000 mg twice \n\ndaily by -1.36% and vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily by -1.09% from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%. \n\nThe decrease in HbA1c observed in patients with a baseline \u226510.0% was greater. \n\n \n\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 318 patients to \n\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with metformin \n\n(\u22651500 mg daily) and glimepiride (\u22654 mg daily). Vildagliptin in combination with metformin and \n\nglimepiride significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean \n\nreduction from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% was -0.76%. \n\n \n\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 449 patients to \n\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with a stable dose \n\nof basal or premixed insulin (mean daily dose 41 units), with concomitant use of metformin (N=276) \n\nor without concomitant metformin (N=173). Vildagliptin in combination with insulin significantly \n\ndecreased HbA1c compared with placebo. In the overall population, the placebo-adjusted mean \n\nreduction from a mean baseline HbA1c 8.8% was -0.72%. In the subgroups treated with insulin with or \n\nwithout concomitant metformin the placebo-adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.63% \n\nand -0.84%, respectively. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was 8.4% and \n\n7.2% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Patients receiving vildagliptin experienced \n\nno weight gain (+0.2 kg) while those receiving placebo experienced weight reduction (-0.7 kg). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIn another 24-week study in patients with more advanced type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on \n\ninsulin (short and longer acting, average insulin dose 80 IU/day), the mean reduction in HbA1c when \n\nvildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was added to insulin was statistically significantly greater than with \n\nplacebo plus insulin (0.5% vs. 0.2%). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the vildagliptin \n\ngroup than in the placebo group (22.9% vs. 29.6%). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular risk \n\nA meta-analysis of independently and prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events from 37 phase \n\nIII and IV monotherapy and combination therapy clinical studies of up to more than 2 years duration \n\n(mean exposure 50 weeks for vildagliptin and 49 weeks for comparators) was performed and showed \n\nthat vildagliptin treatment was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk versus \n\ncomparators. The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) \n\nincluding acute myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was similar for vildagliptin \n\nversus combined active and placebo comparators [Mantel\u2013Haenszel risk ratio (M-H RR) 0.82 (95% CI \n\n0.61-1.11)]. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9,599 (0.86%) vildagliptin-treated patients and in 85 out \n\nof 7,102 (1.20%) comparator-treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component \n\nshowed no increased risk (similar M-H RR). Confirmed heart failure (HF) events defined as HF \n\nrequiring hospitalisation or new onset of HF were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients \n\nand 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients with M-H RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.68-1.70). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nvildagliptin in combination with metformin in all subsets of the paediatric population with type 2 \n\ndiabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nEucreas \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nBioequivalence has been demonstrated between Eucreas at three dose strengths (50 mg/500 mg, \n\n50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg) versus free combination of vildagliptin and metformin \n\nhydrochloride tablets at the corresponding doses. \n \n\nFood does not affect the extent and rate of absorption of vildagliptin from Eucreas. The rate and extent \n\nof absorption of metformin from Eucreas 50 mg/1000 mg were decreased when given with food as \n\nreflected by the decrease in Cmax by 26%, AUC by 7% and delayed Tmax (2.0 to 4.0 h). \n\n \n\nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \n\nEucreas. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration in the fasting state, vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma \n\nconcentrations observed at 1.7 hours. Food slightly delays the time to peak plasma concentration to \n\n2.5 hours, but does not alter the overall exposure (AUC). Administration of vildagliptin with food \n\nresulted in a decreased Cmax (19%) compared to dosing in the fasting state. However, the magnitude of \n\nchange is not clinically significant, so that vildagliptin can be given with or without food. The absolute \n\nbioavailability is 85%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe plasma protein binding of vildagliptin is low (9.3%) and vildagliptin distributes equally between \n\nplasma and red blood cells. The mean volume of distribution of vildagliptin at steady-state after \n\nintravenous administration (Vss) is 71 litres, suggesting extravascular distribution. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nMetabolism is the major elimination pathway for vildagliptin in humans, accounting for 69% of the \n\ndose. The major metabolite (LAY 151) is pharmacologically inactive and is the hydrolysis product of \n\nthe cyano moiety, accounting for 57% of the dose, followed by the amide hydrolysis product (4% of \n\ndose). DPP-4 contributes partially to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin based on an in vivo study using \n\nDPP-4 deficient rats. Vildagliptin is not metabolised by CYP 450 enzymes to any quantifiable extent, \n\nand accordingly the metabolic clearance of vildagliptin is not anticipated to be affected by co-\n\nmedications that are CYP 450 inhibitors and/or inducers. In vitro studies demonstrated that \n\nvildagliptin does not inhibit/induce CYP 450 enzymes. Therefore, vildagliptin is not likely to affect \n\nmetabolic clearance of co-medications metabolised by CYP 1A2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, \n\nCYP 2D6, CYP 2E1 or CYP 3A4/5. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nFollowing oral administration of [14C] vildagliptin, approximately 85% of the dose was excreted into \n\nthe urine and 15% of the dose was recovered in the faeces. Renal excretion of the unchanged \n\nvildagliptin accounted for 23% of the dose after oral administration. After intravenous administration \n\nto healthy subjects, the total plasma and renal clearances of vildagliptin are 41 and 13 l/h, respectively. \n\nThe mean elimination half-life after intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. The \n\nelimination half-life after oral administration is approximately 3 hours. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nThe Cmax for vildagliptin and the area under the plasma concentrations versus time curves (AUC) \n\nincreased in an approximately dose proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nGender: No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin were observed \n\nbetween male and female healthy subjects within a wide range of age and body mass index (BMI). \n\nDPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by gender. \n\n \n\nAge: In healthy elderly subjects (\u2265 70 years), the overall exposure of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) \n\nwas increased by 32%, with an 18% increase in peak plasma concentration as compared to young \n\nhealthy subjects (18-40 years). These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant, however. \n\nDPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by age. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment: In subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A-C) \n\nthere were no clinically significant changes (maximum ~30%) in exposure to vildagliptin. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment: In subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, systemic exposure to \n\nvildagliptin was increased (Cmax 8-66%; AUC 32-134%) and total body clearance was reduced \n\ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. \n\n \n\nEthnic group: Limited data suggest that race does not have any major influence on vildagliptin \n\npharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nMetformin \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter an oral dose of metformin, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved after about \n\n2.5 h. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy \n\nsubjects. After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n\n \n\nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the \n\npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption are non-linear. At the usual metformin doses and dosing \n\nschedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n\n1 \u00b5g/ml. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n\n4 \u00b5g/ml, even at maximum doses. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nFood slightly delays and decreases the extent of the absorption of metformin. Following \n\nadministration of a dose of 850 mg, the plasma peak concentration was 40% lower, AUC was \n\ndecreased by 25% and time to peak plasma concentration was prolonged by 35 minutes. The clinical \n\nrelevance of this decrease is unknown. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The mean volume of \n\ndistribution (Vd) ranged between 63-276 litres. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nMetformin is eliminated by renal excretion. Renal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/min, indicating \n\nthat metformin is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the \n\napparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 h. When renal function is impaired, renal \n\nclearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is \n\nprolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nAnimal studies of up to 13-week duration have been conducted with the combined substances in \n\nEucreas. No new toxicities associated with the combination were identified. The following data are \n\nfindings from studies performed with vildagliptin or metformin individually. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin \n\n \n\nIntra-cardiac impulse conduction delays were observed in dogs with a no-effect dose of 15 mg/kg (7-\n\nfold human exposure based on Cmax). \n\n \n\nAccumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages in the lung was observed in rats and mice. The no-\n\neffect dose in rats was 25 mg/kg (5-fold human exposure based on AUC) and in mice 750 mg/kg (142-\n\nfold human exposure). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal symptoms, particularly soft faeces, mucoid faeces, diarrhoea and, at higher doses, \n\nfaecal blood were observed in dogs. A no-effect level was not established. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin was not mutagenic in conventional in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity. \n\n \n\nA fertility and early embryonic development study in rats revealed no evidence of impaired fertility, \n\nreproductive performance or early embryonic development due to vildagliptin. Embryofoetal toxicity \n\nwas evaluated in rats and rabbits. An increased incidence of wavy ribs was observed in rats in \n\nassociation with reduced maternal body weight parameters, with a no-effect dose of 75 mg/kg (10-fold \n\nhuman exposure). In rabbits, decreased foetal weight and skeletal variations indicative of \n\ndevelopmental delays were noted only in the presence of severe maternal toxicity, with a no-effect \n\ndose of 50 mg/kg (9-fold human exposure). A pre- and postnatal development study was performed in \n\nrats. Findings were only observed in association with maternal toxicity at \u2265 150 mg/kg and included a \n\ntransient decrease in body weight and reduced motor activity in the F1 generation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n18 \n\nA two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral doses up to 900 mg/kg (approximately \n\n200 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose). No increases in tumour incidence \n\nattributable to vildagliptin were observed. Another two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in \n\nmice at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas and \n\nhaemangiosarcomas was observed with a no-effect dose of 500 mg/kg (59-fold human exposure) and \n\n100 mg/kg (16-fold human exposure), respectively. The increased incidence of these tumours in mice \n\nis considered not to represent a significant risk to humans based on the lack of genotoxicity of \n\nvildagliptin and its principal metabolite, the occurrence of tumours only in one species, and the high \n\nsystemic exposure ratios at which tumours were observed. \n\n \n\nIn a 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, skin lesions have been recorded at doses \n\n\u2265 5 mg/kg/day. These were consistently located on the extremities (hands, feet, ears and tail). At \n\n5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose), only blisters \n\nwere observed. They were reversible despite continued treatment and were not associated with \n\nhistopathological abnormalities. Flaking skin, peeling skin, scabs and tail sores with correlating \n\nhistopathological changes were noted at doses \u2265 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times human AUC \n\nexposure at the 100 mg dose). Necrotic lesions of the tail were observed at \u2265 80 mg/kg/day. Skin \n\nlesions were not reversible in the monkeys treated at 160 mg/kg/day during a 4-week recovery period. \n\n \n\nMetformin \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data on metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \n\nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to \n\nreproduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nEucreas 50 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets \n\nEucreas 50 mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets \n\nvildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1. What Eucreas is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Eucreas \n\n3. How to take Eucreas \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Eucreas \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Eucreas is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThe active substances of Eucreas, vildagliptin and metformin, belong to a group of medicines called \n\n\u201coral antidiabetics\u201d. \n\n \n\nEucreas is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes is also known as non-\n\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\nType 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body \n\nmakes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. \n\n \n\nBoth insulin and glucagon are made in the pancreas. Insulin helps to lower the level of sugar in the \n\nblood, especially after meals. Glucagon triggers the liver to make sugar, causing the blood sugar level \n\nto rise. \n\n \n\nHow Eucreas works \n\nBoth active substances, vildagliptin and metformin, help to control the level of sugar in the blood. The \n\nsubstance vildagliptin works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. The \n\nsubstance metformin works by helping the body to make better use of insulin. This medicine has been \n\nshown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent complications from your diabetes. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Eucreas \n\n \n\nDo not take Eucreas \n- if you are allergic to vildagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic to any of these, talk to your doctor before \n\ntaking Eucreas. \n\n  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see \u201cRisk of lactic \n\nacidosis\u201d below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ketone \n\nbodies accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \n\nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \n\nsmell. \n\n- if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your \nblood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems. \n\n- if you have severely reduced kidney function. \n- if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your \n\nbody). \n\n- if you are going to have a contrast x-ray (a specific type of x-ray involving an injectable dye). \nPlease also see information about this in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d. \n\n- if you have liver problems. \n- if you drink alcohol excessively (whether every day or only from time to time). \n- if you are breast-feeding (see also \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d). \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nRisk of lactic acidosis \n\nEucreas may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your \n\nkidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \n\nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \n\ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \n\nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. \n\n \n\nStop taking Eucreas for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \n\ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \n\nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions. \n \n\nStop taking Eucreas and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience \n\nsome of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. \n\nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include: \n\n- vomiting \n- stomach ache (abdominal pain) \n- muscle cramps \n- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness \n- difficulty in breathing \n- reduced body temperature and heartbeat \n \n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. \n\n \n\nEucreas is not a substitute for insulin. Therefore, you should not receive Eucreas for the treatment of \n\ntype 1 diabetes. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Eucreas if you have or have had a disease of the \n\npancreas. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Eucreas if you are taking an anti-diabetic \n\nmedicine known as a sulphonylurea. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea \n\nwhen you take it together with Eucreas in order to avoid low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nIf you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should \n\nnot take this medicine. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nDiabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the \n\nrecommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also \n\nadvised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking Eucreas. Should these \n\noccur, you should promptly consult your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Eucreas during and for some time after the \n\nprocedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \n\nEucreas. \n\n \n\nA test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Eucreas treatment, at \n\nthree-month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. This is so that signs of increased \n\nliver enzymes can be detected as early as possible. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Eucreas, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or \n\nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or have worsening renal function. \n \n\nYour doctor will test your blood and urine for sugar regularly. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Eucreas in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Eucreas \nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \n\nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Eucreas before or at the time of the \n\ninjection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \n\nEucreas. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may \n\nneed more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the \n\ndosage of Eucreas. It is especially important to mention the following: \n\n- glucocorticoids generally used to treat inflammation \n- beta-2 agonists generally used to treat respiratory disorders \n- other medicines used to treat diabetes \n- medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) \n\n- medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as \n\nibuprofen and celecoxib) \n\n- certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists) \n\n- certain medicines affecting the thyroid, or \n- certain medicines affecting the nervous system. \n \n\nEucreas with alcohol \nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Eucreas since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis \n\n(please see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \nfor advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of \n\ntaking Eucreas during pregnancy. \n\n- Do not use Eucreas if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also \u201cDo not take Eucreas\u201d). \n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy while taking Eucreas, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n3. How to take Eucreas \n\n \n\nThe amount of Eucreas that people have to take varies depending on their condition. Your doctor will \n\ntell you exactly the dose of Eucreas to take. \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one film-coated tablet of either 50 mg/850 mg or 50 mg/1000 mg taken \n\ntwice a day \n\n \n\nIf you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose. Also if you are taking \n\nan anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea your doctor may prescribe a lower dose. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe this medicine alone or with certain other medicines that lower the level of \n\nsugar in your blood. \n\n \n\nWhen and how to take Eucreas \n\n- Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water, \n- Take one tablet in the morning and the other in the evening with or just after food. Taking the \n\ntablet just after food will lower the risk of an upset stomach. \n\n \n\nContinue to follow any advice about diet that your doctor has given you. In particular, if you are \n\nfollowing a diabetic weight control diet, continue with this while you are taking Eucreas. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Eucreas than you should \n\nIf you take too many Eucreas tablets, or if someone else takes your tablets, talk to a doctor or \n\npharmacist immediately. Medical attention may be necessary. If you have to go to a doctor or \n\nhospital, take the pack and this leaflet with you. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Eucreas \nIf you forget to take a tablet, take it with your next meal unless you are due to take one then anyway. \n\nDo not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Eucreas \nContinue to take this medicine as long as your doctor prescribes it so that it can continue to control \n\nyour blood sugar. Do not stop taking Eucreas unless your doctor tells you to. If you have any questions \n\nabout how long to take this medicine, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

called \"oral antidiabetics\". eucreas is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. this type of diabetes is also known as non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body makes does not work as well as it should. it can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. both insulin and glucagon are made in the pancreas. insulin helps to lower the level of sugar in the blood, especially after meals. glucagon triggers the liver to make sugar, causing the blood sugar level to rise. how eucreas works both active substances, vildagliptin and metformin, help to control the level of sugar in the blood. the substance vildagliptin works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. the substance metformin works by helping the body to make better use of insulin. this medicine has been shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent complications from your diabetes.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "eucreas", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "eucreas", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 25, "EndOffset": 32}, {"Id":

you take eucreas", "Section_Content": "do not take eucreas - if you are allergic to vildagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you think you may be allergic to any of these, talk to your doctor before taking eucreas. - if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see \"risk of lactic acidosis\" below) or ketoacidosis. ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ketone bodies accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. symptoms include stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity smell. - if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your blood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems. - if you have severely reduced kidney function. - if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your body). - if you are going to have a contrast x-ray (a specific type of x-ray involving an injectable dye). please also see information about this in section \"warnings and precautions\". - if you have liver problems. - if you drink alcohol excessively (whether every day or only from time to time). - if you are breast-feeding (see also \"pregnancy and breast-feeding\"). warnings and precautions risk of lactic acidosis eucreas may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. the risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. stop taking eucreas for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. talk to your doctor for further instructions. stop taking eucreas and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. symptoms of lactic acidosis include: - vomiting - stomach ache (abdominal pain) - muscle cramps - a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness - difficulty in breathing - reduced body temperature and heartbeat lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. eucreas is not a substitute for insulin. therefore, you should not receive eucreas for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking eucreas if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking eucreas if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea. your doctor may want to reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea when you take it together with eucreas in order to avoid low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). if you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should not take this medicine. diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. you are advised to follow the recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. you are also advised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking eucreas. should these occur, you should promptly consult your doctor. if you need to have major surgery you must stop taking eucreas during and for some time after the procedure. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with eucreas. a test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of eucreas treatment, at three-month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. this is so that signs of increased liver enzymes can be detected as early as possible. during treatment with eucreas, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or more frequently if you are elderly and/or have worsening renal function. your doctor will test your blood and urine for sugar regularly. children and adolescents the use of eucreas in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. other medicines and eucreas if you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for example in the context of an x-ray or scan, you must stop taking eucreas before or at the time of the injection. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with eucreas. tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. you may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the dosage of eucreas. it is especially important to mention the following: - glucocorticoids generally used to treat inflammation - beta-2 agonists generally used to treat respiratory disorders - other medicines used to treat diabetes - medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) - medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (nsaid and cox-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen and celecoxib) - certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists) - certain medicines affecting the thyroid, or - certain medicines affecting the nervous system. eucreas with alcohol avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking eucreas since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (please see section \"warnings and precautions\"). pregnancy and breast-feeding - if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of taking eucreas during pregnancy. - do not use eucreas if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also \"do not take eucreas\"). ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines if you feel dizzy while taking eucreas, do not drive or use any tools or machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "eucreas", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
