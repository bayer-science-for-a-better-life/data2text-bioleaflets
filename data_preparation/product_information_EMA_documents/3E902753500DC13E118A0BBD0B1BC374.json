NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRuconest 2100 Units powder for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains 2100 units of conestat alfa, corresponding to 2100 units per 14 ml after reconstitution, or a \nconcentration of 150 units/ml.  \n \nConestat alfa is a recombinant analogue of the human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH) produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology in the milk of transgenic rabbits.  \n \n1 unit of conestat alfa activity is defined as the equivalent of C1 esterase inhibiting activity present in 1 ml of \npooled normal plasma. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach vial contains approximately 19.5 mg sodium.  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \nWhite to off-white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRuconest is indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents, and children (aged \n2 years and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRuconest should be initiated under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of hereditary angioedema. \n \nPosology in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above \nBody weight up to 84 kg \n- One intravenous injection of 50 U/kg body weight. \n \nBody weight of 84 kg or greater  \n- One intravenous injection of 4200 U (2 vials). \n \nIn the majority of cases, a single dose of Ruconest is sufficient to treat an acute angioedema attack.  \nIn case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose (50 U/kg body weight up to 4200 U) can be \nadministered at the discretion of the physician (see section 5.1). \n \n- In adults and adolescents an additional dose may be administered if the patient has not responded \n\nadequately after 120 minutes.  \n- In children an additional dose may be administered if the patient has not responded adequately after 60 \n\nminutes. \n \nNot more than two doses should be administered within 24 hours. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nDose calculation \nDetermine the patient’s body weight. \n \nBody weight up to 84 kg \n- For patients up to 84 kg calculate the volume required to be administered according to the formula below: \n \n\nVolume to be \nadministered (ml)  = \n\nbody weight (kg) times 50 (U/kg) \n150 (U/ml) = \n\nbody weight (kg) \n3 \n\n \nBody weight of 84 kg or greater  \n- For patients of 84 kg or above the volume required to be administered is 28 ml, corresponding to 4200 U \n\n(2 vials). \n \nPaediatric population  \nRuconest may be used in paediatric patients (2 years and older) at the same dose as in adults (50 U/kg body \nweight).  \nThe safety and efficacy of Ruconest in children less than 2 years old have not been established. No clinical \ndata are available.  \n \nElderly (≥65 years old)  \nData in patients older than 65 years are limited.  \nThere is no rationale for patients older than 65 years to respond differently to Ruconest.  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment since conestat alfa does not undergo renal \nclearance. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no clinical experience with Ruconest in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment may \nprolong the plasma half-life of conestat alfa, but this is not thought to be a clinical concern. No \nrecommendation on a dose adjustment can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use. \nRuconest should be administered by a healthcare professional. \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Ruconest before administration, see section 6.6. \nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection \nover approximately 5 minutes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Known or suspected allergy to rabbits (see section 4.4)  \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered products should be clearly recorded. \n \nConestat alfa is derived from milk of transgenic rabbits and contains traces of rabbit protein. Before initiating \ntreatment with Ruconest, patients should be queried about prior exposure to rabbits and signs and symptoms \nsuggestive of an allergic reaction. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions cannot be excluded.  \nAll patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms of hypersensitivity during \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nand after the administration period. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity \nreactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and \nanaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur after administration, they should alert their physician. \nIn case of anaphylactic reactions or shock, emergency medical treatment should be administered. \nAlthough cross-reactivity between cow milk and rabbit milk is considered unlikely, the possibility of such a \ncross-reactivity in a patient who has evidence of clinical allergy to cow milk cannot be excluded and the \npatient should be observed for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity following Ruconest administration. \n \nSodium \nEach vial of Ruconest contains 19.5 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled \nsodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nScientific literature indicates an interaction of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and C1-INH \ncontaining medicinal products. Ruconest should not be administered simultaneously with tPA. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThere is no experience with the use of Ruconest in pregnant and breast-feeding women. \nIn one animal study reproductive toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). Ruconest is not recommended for \nuse during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless the treating physician judges the benefits to outweigh the \npossible risks.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of Ruconest on male or female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on the known pharmacology and adverse reaction profile of Ruconest, effects on the ability to drive \nand use machines are not expected. However, headache, vertigo and dizziness have been reported following \nthe use of Ruconest, but may also occur as a result of an attack of HAE. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive and use machines if they experience headache, vertigo or dizziness. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nOne case of hypersensitivity was observed in clinical trials with Ruconest. The most common adverse \nreaction observed after administration of Ruconest is nausea. \n \nTabulated lists of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions obtained from clinical trials in patients with HAE following acute attack treatment with \nRuconest are tabulated below. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of \nadverse reactions was similar for all dose groups and did not increase upon repeated administration. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nVery common (≥1/10), \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nVery rare (<1/10,000),  \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadache Uncommon \n\nVertigo Uncommon \n\nHypoaesthesia Uncommon \n\nDizziness Uncommon \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Auricular swelling Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nThroat irritation Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea  Common \n\nDiarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal discomfort Uncommon \n\nOral paraesthesia Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUrticaria Uncommon \n\n \nPaediatric population \nIn the clinical development program, 37 children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) with HAE were \ntreated for 124 acute angioedema attacks. Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children and \nadolescents were similar to those in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo clinical information on overdose is available.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC code: \nB06AC04. \n \nThe plasma protein C1-INH is the main regulator of activation of the contact and complement systems in \nvivo. HAE patients have a heterozygous deficiency of the plasma protein C1-INH. As a result they may \nsuffer from uncontrolled activation of contact and complement systems, with formation of inflammatory \nmediators, which clinically becomes manifest as the occurrence of acute angioedema attacks. \n \nConestat alfa, a recombinant human complement component 1 (C1) esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH), is an \nanalogue of human C1-INH and is obtained from the milk of rabbits expressing the gene coding for human \nC1-INH. The amino acid sequence of conestat alfa is identical to that of endogenous C1-INH. \n \nC1-INH exerts an inhibitory effect on several proteases (target proteases) of the contact and complement \nsystems. The effect of conestat alfa on the following target proteases was assessed in vitro: activated C1s, \nkallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. Inhibition kinetics were found to be comparable with those observed \nfor plasma-derived human C1-INH. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nThe complement component (protein) C4, is a substrate for activated C1s. Patients with HAE have low \nlevels of C4 in the circulation. As for plasma-derived C1-INH, the pharmacodynamic effects of conestat alfa \non C4 show dose-dependent restoration of complement homeostasis in HAE patients at a plasma C1-INH \nactivity level greater than 0.7 U/ml, which is the lower limit of the normal range. In HAE patients, Ruconest \nat a dose of 50 U/kg increases plasma C1-INH activity level to greater than 0.7 U/ml for approximately \n2 hours (see section 5.2). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Ruconest as a treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult and adolescent \npatients with HAE has been evaluated in two double blind randomized placebo controlled and four open \nlabel clinical studies. The doses evaluated in the clinical studies ranged from a single vial of 2100 U \n(corresponding to 18-40 U/kg), to 50 and 100 U/kg. Efficacy of Ruconest as a treatment for acute \nangioedema attacks was demonstrated by significantly shorter time to beginning of relief of symptoms and \ntime to minimal symptoms and few therapeutic failures. The table below shows the results (primary and \nsecondary endpoints) of the two randomized controlled trials: \n \n\n \nStudy \n\n \nTreatment  \n\nTime (minutes) to  \nbeginning of relief \nmedian (95% CI) \n\nTime (minutes) to  \nminimal symptoms \nmedian (95% CI) \n\nC1 1205 RCT 100 U/kg \nn =13 \n\n68 (62, 132) \np = 0.001 \n\n245 (125, 270) \np = 0.04 \n\n50 U/kg \nn =12 \n\n122 (72, 136) \np < 0.001 \n\n247 (243, 484) \n \n\nSaline \nn = 13 \n\n258 (240, 495) 1101 (970, 1494) \n\nC1 1304 RCT 100 U/kg \nn =16 \n\n62 (40, 75) \np = 0.003 \n\n480 (243, 723) \np = 0.005 \n\nSaline \nn = 16 \n\n508 (70, 720) \n \n\n1440 (720, 2885) \n \n\n \nThe results of the open label studies were consistent with the above findings and support the repeated use of \nRuconest in the treatment of subsequent attacks of angioedema. \n \nIn the randomized controlled trials 39/41 (95%) of patients treated with Ruconest reached time to beginning \nof relief within 4 hours. In an open label study 146/151 (97%) attacks treated with a single dose of 50 U/kg \nreached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was administered for \n17/168 (10%) attacks. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren \nIn an open label study with 20 children with HAE (aged 5 to 14 years), 64/67 (96%) attacks treated with a \nsingle dose of 50 U/kg reached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was \nadministered for 3/73 (4%) attacks. \n \nAdolescents \nTen adolescent HAE patients (aged 13 to 17 years) were treated with 50 U/kg for 27 acute angioedema \nattacks, and 7 (aged 16 to 17 years) with 2100 U for 24 acute angioedema attacks.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety results in children and adolescents were consistent with those in adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nNo formal distribution studies have been performed. The distribution volume of conestat alfa was \napproximately 3 L, comparable to plasma volume.  \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nBased on animal data, conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation by the liver via receptor-mediated \nendocytosis followed by complete hydrolysis/degradation. \n \nAfter administration of Ruconest (50 U/kg) to asymptomatic HAE patients, a Cmax of 1.36 U/ml was \nobserved. The elimination half-life of conestat alfa was approximately 2 hours. \n \nExcretion \nThere is no excretion, as conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis \nfollowed by complete hydrolysis/degradation in the liver. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren \nAfter receiving a conestat alfa dose of 50 U/kg, a total of 18/20 children had concentrations of functional C1-\nINH that were >70% of normal (the lower limit of the normal range) at the 5-minute and/or 2-4 hour post-\ndose time points. The arithmetic mean functional C1-INH Cmax for the first attack was 123% of normal \n(range 62% to 168%) and the AUC0-3 was 171% of normal (range 95% to 244%). \n \nA population PK model shows that a dose of 50 U/kg will achieve concentrations of functional C1-INH that \nare >70% of normal in 96.0% of children aged 2 to ≤13 years and in 90.5% of children aged 2 to <5 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data do not indicate any safety concern for the use of conestat alfa in humans based on studies of \nsafety pharmacology, single-dose toxicity, two-week sub-chronic toxicity and local tolerance in various \nanimal species including rats, dogs, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Genotoxic and carcinogenic potential \nis not expected. \n \nEmbryofoetal studies in rat and rabbit; Daily single doses of vehicle or 625 U/kg/administration of conestat \nalfa were administered intravenously to mated rats and rabbits.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRuconest 2100 Units powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nPowder vial: \nOne vial contains 2100 units of conestat alfa, corresponding to 2100 units per 14 ml after reconstitution, or a \nconcentration of 150 units/ml.  \n \nConestat alfa is a recombinant analogue of the human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH) produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology in the milk of transgenic rabbits.  \n \n1 unit of conestat alfa activity is defined as the equivalent of C1 esterase inhibiting activity present in 1 ml of \npooled normal plasma. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach powder vial contains approximately 19.5 mg sodium.  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nWhite to off-white powder. \nThe solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRuconest is indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents, and children (aged \n2 years and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRuconest should be initiated under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of hereditary angioedema. \n \nPosology in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above \nBody weight up to 84 kg  \n- One intravenous injection of 50 U/kg body weight. \n \nBody weight of 84 kg or greater  \n- One intravenous injection of 4200 U (2 vials). \n \nIn the majority of cases, a single dose of Ruconest is sufficient to treat an acute angioedema attack.  \nIn case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose (50 U/kg body weight up to 4200 U) can be \nadministered (see section 5.1). \n \n- In adults and adolescents an additional dose may be administered if the patient has not responded \n\nadequately after 120 minutes.  \n- In children an additional dose may be administered if the patient has not responded adequately after 60 \n\nminutes. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nNot more than two doses should be administered within 24 hours. \n \nDose calculation \nDetermine the patient’s body weight. \n \nBody weight up to 84 kg  \n- For patients up to 84 kg calculate the volume required to be administered according to the formula below: \n \n\nVolume to be \nadministered (ml)  = \n\nbody weight (kg) times 50 (U/kg) \n150 (U/ml) = \n\nbody weight (kg) \n3 \n\n \nBody weight of 84 kg or greater  \n- For patients of 84 kg or above the volume required to be administered is 28 ml, corresponding to 4200 U \n\n(2 vials). \n \nPaediatric population  \nRuconest may be used in paediatric patients (2 years and older) at the same dose as in adults (50 U/kg body \nweight).  \nThe safety and efficacy of Ruconest in children less than 2 years old have not been established. No clinical \ndata are available. \n \nElderly (≥65 years old)  \nData in patients older than 65 years are limited.  \nThere is no rationale for patients older than 65 years to respond differently to Ruconest.  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment since conestat alfa does not undergo renal \nclearance. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no clinical experience with Ruconest in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment may \nprolong the plasma half-life of conestat alfa, but this is not thought to be a clinical concern. No \nrecommendation on a dose adjustment can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use. \nRuconest must be administered by a healthcare professional until the patient (or caregiver) is competent to \nadminister after having been properly trained and in agreement with the healthcare professional. \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Ruconest before administration, see section 6.6. \nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection \nover approximately 5 minutes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Known or suspected allergy to rabbits (see section 4.4)  \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered products should be clearly recorded. \n \nConestat alfa is derived from milk of transgenic rabbits and contains traces of rabbit protein. Before initiating \ntreatment with Ruconest, patients should be queried about prior exposure to rabbits and signs and symptoms \nsuggestive of an allergic reaction.  \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions cannot be excluded.  \nAll patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms of hypersensitivity during \nand after the administration period. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity \nreactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and \nanaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur after administration, they should alert their physician. \nIn case of anaphylactic reactions or shock, emergency medical treatment should be administered. \nAlthough cross-reactivity between cow milk and rabbit milk is considered unlikely, the possibility of such a \ncross-reactivity in a patient who has evidence of clinical allergy to cow milk cannot be excluded and the \npatient should be observed for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity following Ruconest administration.  \n \nSodium \nEach vial of Ruconest contains 19.5 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled \nsodium diet. \n \nHome-treatment and self-administration \nThere are limited data on the use of this medicinal product in home- or self-administration. Potential risks \nassociated with home-treatment are related to the administration itself as well as the handling of adverse \nreactions, particularly hypersensitivity. The decision on the use of home-treatment for an individual patient \nshould be made by the treating physician, who should ensure that appropriate training is provided and the use \nreviewed at intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nScientific literature indicates an interaction of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and C1-INH \ncontaining medicinal products. Ruconest should not be administered simultaneously with tPA. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThere is no experience with the use of Ruconest in pregnant and breast-feeding women. \nIn one animal study reproductive toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). Ruconest is not recommended for \nuse during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless the treating physician judges the benefits to outweigh the \npossible risks.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of Ruconest on male or female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on the known pharmacology and adverse reaction profile of Ruconest, effects on the ability to drive \nand use machines are not expected. However headache, vertigo and dizziness have been reported following \nthe use of Ruconest, but may also occur as a result of an attack of HAE. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive and use machines if they experience headache, vertigo or dizziness. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nOne case of hypersensitivity was observed in clinical trials with Ruconest. The most common adverse \nreaction observed after administration of Ruconest is nausea.  \n \nTabulated lists of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions obtained from clinical trials in patients with HAE following acute attack treatment with \nRuconest are tabulated below. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of \nadverse reactions was similar for all dose groups and did not increase upon repeated administrations. \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nVery common (≥1/10), \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nVery rare (<1/10,000),  \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadache Uncommon \n\nVertigo Uncommon \n\nHypoaesthesia Uncommon \n\nDizziness Uncommon \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Auricular swelling Uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nThroat irritation Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea  Common \n\nDiarrhoea Uncommon \n\nAbdominal discomfort Uncommon \n\nOral paraesthesia Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUrticaria Uncommon \n\n \nPaediatric population \nIn the clinical development program, 37 children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) with HAE were \ntreated for 124 acute angioedema attacks. Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children and \nadolescents were similar to those in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo clinical information on overdose is available.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC code: \nB06AC04. \n \nThe plasma protein C1-INH is the main regulator of activation of the contact and complement systems in \nvivo. HAE patients have a heterozygous deficiency of the plasma protein C1-INH. As a result they may \nsuffer from uncontrolled activation of contact and complement systems, with formation of inflammatory \nmediators, which clinically becomes manifest as the occurrence of acute angioedema attacks. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nConestat alfa, a recombinant human complement component 1 (C1) esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH), is an \nanalogue of human C1-INH and is obtained from the milk of rabbits expressing the gene coding for human \nC1-INH. The amino acid sequence of conestat alfa is identical to that of endogenous C1-INH. \n \nC1-INH exerts an inhibitory effect on several proteases (target proteases) of the contact and complement \nsystems. The effect of conestat alfa on the following target proteases was assessed in vitro: activated C1s, \nkallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. Inhibition kinetics were found to be comparable with those observed \nfor plasma-derived human C1-INH. \n \nThe complement component (protein) C4, is a substrate for activated C1s. Patients with HAE have low \nlevels of C4 in the circulation. As for plasma-derived C1-INH, the pharmacodynamic effects of conestat alfa \non C4 show dose-dependent restoration of complement homeostasis in HAE patients at a plasma C1-INH \nactivity level greater than 0.7 U/ml, which is the lower limit of the normal range. In HAE patients, Ruconest \nat a dose of 50 U/kg increases plasma C1-INH activity level to greater than 0.7 U/ml for approximately \n2 hours (see section 5.2). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Ruconest as a treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult and adolescent \npatients with HAE has been evaluated in two double blind randomized placebo controlled and four open \nlabel clinical studies. The doses evaluated in the clinical studies ranged from a single vial of 2100 U \n(corresponding to 18-40 U/kg), to 50 and 100 U/kg. Efficacy of Ruconest as a treatment for acute \nangioedema attacks was demonstrated by significantly shorter time to beginning of relief of symptoms and \ntime to minimal symptoms and few therapeutic failures. The table below shows the results (primary and \nsecondary endpoints) of the two randomized controlled trials: \n \n\n \nStudy \n\n \nTreatment  \n\nTime (minutes) to  \nbeginning of relief \nmedian (95% CI) \n\nTime (minutes) to  \nminimal symptoms \nmedian (95% CI) \n\nC1 1205 RCT 100 U/kg \nn =13 \n\n68 (62, 132) \np = 0.001 \n\n245 (125, 270) \np = 0.04 \n\n50 U/kg \nn =12 \n\n122 (72, 136) \np < 0.001 \n\n247 (243, 484) \n \n\nSaline \nn = 13 \n\n258 (240, 495) 1101 (970, 1494) \n\nC1 1304 RCT 100 U/kg \nn =16 \n\n62 (40, 75) \np = 0.003 \n\n480 (243, 723) \np = 0.005 \n\nSaline \nn = 16 \n\n508 (70, 720) \n \n\n1440 (720, 2885) \n \n\n \nThe results of the open label studies were consistent with the above findings and support the repeated use of \nRuconest in the treatment of subsequent attacks of angioedema. \n \nIn the randomized controlled trials 39/41 (95%) of patients treated with Ruconest reached time to beginning \nof relief within 4 hours. In an open label study 146/151 (97%) attacks treated with a single dose of 50 U/kg \nreached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was administered for \n17/168 (10%) attacks. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren \nIn an open label study with 20 children with HAE (aged 5 to 14 years), 64/67 (96%) attacks treated with a \nsingle dose of 50 U/kg reached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was \nadministered for 3/73 (4%) attacks. \n \nAdolescents \nTen adolescent HAE patients (aged 13 to 17 years) were treated with 50 U/kg for 27 acute angioedema \nattacks, and 7 (aged 16 to 17 years) with 2100 U for 24 acute angioedema attacks.  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nThe efficacy and safety results in children and adolescents were consistent with those in adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nNo formal distribution studies have been performed. The distribution volume of conestat alfa was \napproximately 3 L, comparable to plasma volume.  \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nBased on animal data, conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation by the liver via receptor-mediated \nendocytosis followed by complete hydrolysis/degradation. \n \nAfter administration of Ruconest (50 U/kg) to asymptomatic HAE patients, a Cmax of 1.36 U/ml was \nobserved. The elimination half-life of conestat alfa was approximately 2 hours. \n \nExcretion \nThere is no excretion, as conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis \nfollowed by complete hydrolysis/degradation in the liver. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren \nAfter receiving a conestat alfa dose of 50 U/kg, a total of 18/20 children had concentrations of functional C1-\nINH that were >70% of normal (the lower limit of the normal range) at the 5-minute and/or 2-4 hour post-\ndose time points. The arithmetic mean functional C1-INH Cmax for the first attack was 123% of normal \n(range 62% to 168%) and the AUC0-3 was 171% of normal (range 95% to 244%). \n \nA population PK model shows that a dose of 50 U/kg will achieve concentrations of functional C1-INH that \nare >70% of normal in 96.0% of children aged 2 to ≤13 years and in 90.5% of children aged 2 to <5 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data do not indicate any safety concern for the use of conestat alfa in humans based on studies of \nsafety pharmacology, single-dose toxicity, two-week sub-chronic toxicity and local tolerance in various \nanimal species including rats, dogs, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Genotoxic and carcinogenic potential \nis not expected. \n \nEmbryofoetal studies in rat and rabbit; Daily single doses of vehicle or 625 U/kg/administration of conestat \nalfa were administered intravenously to mated rats and rabbits. In the study in rats there were no malformed \nfoetuses in either the conestat alfa or the control group. In a rabbit embryotoxicity study an increase in the \nincidence of foetal cardiac vessel defects (1.12% in the treatment group versus 0.03% in historical controls) \nwas observed for animals that were administered conestat alfa. \n \n \n6.

From a \nmicrobiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used immediately \nin-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be \nlonger than 24 hours at 2 to 8ºC, unless reconstitution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic \nconditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nPowder vial: \nDo not store above 25°C. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nSolvent vial: \nDo no store above 25°C. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nPowder vial: 2100 units of conestat alfa powder in a vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (siliconized \nchlorobutyl rubber) and a flip-off seal (aluminium and coloured plastic). \n \nSolvent vial: 20 ml of water for injections in a vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (siliconized chlorobutyl \nrubber) and a flip-off seal (aluminium and coloured plastic). \n \nAdministration kit: \n- 1 powder vial \n- 1 solvent vial \n- 2 vial adapters \n- 1 syringe \n- 1 infusion set with 35 cm tubing and 25G needle \n- 2 alcohol pads \n- 1 sterile non-woven pad \n- 1 self-adhesive plaster \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nPreparation and handling \nEach vial of Ruconest is for single use only. \nRuconest is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution with water for injections. An aseptic \ntechnique should be used for reconstitution, combining and mixing the solutions. \n \nReconstitution \n1. Each vial of Ruconest (2100 U) should be reconstituted with 14 ml of solvent. \n2. Disinfect the rubber stoppers of the powder and solvent vials and put a vial adapter onto each solvent \n\nand powder vial until it snaps onto the vial neck. \n3. Attach the syringe to the adapter on the solvent vial and turn clockwise until it locks. Draw in 14 ml of \n\nsolvent. Unlock the syringe from the adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the vial with \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nadapter. \n4. Attach the syringe with solvent to the adapter on the powder vial and turn clockwise until it locks. The \n\nsolvent should be added slowly to avoid forceful impact on the powder and mixed gently to minimise \nfoaming of the solution. Leave the syringe on the adapter. Repeat steps 3 and 4 if you need to prepare \na second solution (this requires a second kit). \n\n5. The reconstituted solution contains 150 U/ml conestat alfa and appears as a clear colourless solution. \nThe reconstituted solution in each vial should be visually inspected for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration. A solution exhibiting particulates or discoloration should not be used. Small amounts of \nfoam are acceptable. The medicinal product should be used immediately (see section 6.3). \n\n \nAdministration \n1. Draw in the required volume of prepared solution. Never exceed 14 ml per syringe. Unlock the \n\nsyringe(s) by turning counter clockwise and discard the vial with adapter. \n2. Attach the infusion set to the syringe and turn clockwise until it locks. Hold the syringe with the tip \n\npointing upwards and gently press the plunger to fill the infusion set with the solution. \n3. Disinfect the injection site with an alcohol pad. Remove the needle cap from the needle of the infusion \n\nset and carefully insert the needle into the vein. \n4. Ensure that the tourniquet is released. Gently inject the solution into the vein – inject over about 5 \n\nminutes. \n5. If two syringes were prepared: fold over the tubing to prevent backflow, unscrew the empty syringe \n\nfrom the infusion set (counter clockwise) and immediately replace it with the second syringe. Gently \ninject the solution of the second syringe.  \n\n \nDisposal \nPlease safely dispose of the used infusion set with needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty \nvial in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly. \nDo not reuse equipment. \n \n \n7.

Water for injections \nshould be added slowly to avoid forceful impact on the powder and mixed gently to minimise foaming of the \nsolution. The reconstituted solution in each vial contains 2100 U conestat alfa at 150 U/ml and appears as a \nclear colourless solution. \n \nThe reconstituted solution in each vial should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration. A \nsolution exhibiting particulates or discoloration should not be used. The medicinal product should be used \nimmediately.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nRuconest 2100 Units powder and solvent for solution for injection  \nconestat alfa \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Never use any kit component after the expiry date stated on the big outer \n\ncarton. \nWithin a single kit box, different components may have different expiry dates. The expiry date on \nthe outer carton reflects the date of the component with the shortest shelf-life.  \n\n• Allow the number of powder and solvent vials required according to step 1, to reach room \ntemperature. \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n \nPreparation of solution \nStep 1: Cleaning and other requirements \n• Wash your hands carefully. \n• Put the powder and solvent vials required on a flat and clean surface. \n\n- body weight 42 kg or less: 1 powder and 1 solvent vial \n- body weight over 42 kg: 2 powder and 2 solvent vials \n\n• Put the vial adapters on the work surface. Do not remove the adapter packaging.  \n- 2 adapters if 1 powder and 1 solvent vial is required \n- 4 adapters if 2 powder and 2 solvent vials are required \n\n• Put the syringe(s) on the work surface. Do not remove the syringe packaging. \n- 1 syringe if 1 powder and 1 solvent vial is required \n- 2 syringes if 2 powder and 2 solvent vials are required \n\n \nStep 2: Disinfection of vial stoppers \n• Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder and solvent vials. \n• Use one alcohol pad to disinfect all vial stoppers and wait for at least 30 seconds until the stoppers \n\nhave dried. \n\n \n \n• After disinfection, do not touch the stoppers with your fingers or anything else. \n \nStep 3: Mounting of adapters on vials \n• Take a packaged adapter in one hand and remove the lid. The adapter must remain in its plastic \n\npackaging.  \n• Put the adapter onto a powder vial, piercing the stopper, until it snaps onto the vial neck. \n\n \n \n• Leave the packaging on the adapter until you attach the syringe in steps 4 and 5. \n• Repeat the above steps for mounting an adapter on the solvent vial. All adapters supplied with the kit \n\nare identical. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n• If you need to use a second powder and solvent vial, repeat the above steps. \n \nStep 4: Drawing up solvent \n• Take a sterile syringe out of its packaging. \n• Remove the packaging from the adapter on the solvent vial. \n\n \n \n• Hold the adapter with one hand. With the other hand, attach the syringe and secure by turning it \n\nclockwise until it stops. \n\n \n \n• Turn the whole – solvent vial with adapter and syringe – upside down. While keeping it vertical, \n\nslowly draw in 14 ml solvent. \nIf air bubbles appear, minimise as far as possible by gently tapping the syringe and applying gentle \npressure by pushing the plunger into the syringe. Continue to fill the syringe with 14 ml solvent. \n\n \n \n• Unlock the syringe from the adapter by turning counter-clockwise. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n• Leave the remainder of the solvent in the vial and discard the vial. \n• Place the syringe on the work surface, taking care not to touch the surface or any other object with the \n\nsyringe tip. \n \nStep 5: Adding solvent to powder and dissolving \n• Remove the packaging from the adapter on the powder vial. \n• Take the syringe with solvent that you prepared in step 4. \n• Hold the adapter with the other hand and attach the syringe. Secure the syringe by turning it clockwise \n\nuntil it stops.  \n• Push the solvent slowly, in a single motion, into the powder vial in order to minimise foaming. \n \n\n \n \n• Leave the syringe on the adapter and gently swirl the vial for approximately half a minute. Do not \n\nshake. \nAfter swirling, leave the vial on the surface for several minutes until the solution has become clear. If \nundissolved powder is still present, repeat the procedure. \n\n \n \n• Repeat steps 4 and 5 if you need to prepare a second solution. \n \nStep 6: Check prepared solutions \n• Check whether the powder in the vial(s) has dissolved completely and the plunger is completely \n\npushed down in the syringe. \n• After the powder has dissolved, the solution should be clear and colourless. \n• Do not use the prepared solution if it is cloudy, contains particles or has changed colour. Inform your \n\nhealthcare professional if this occurs. Small amounts of foam are acceptable. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nStep 7: Drawing up prepared solution \n• Calculate the millilitres of prepared solution to be injected. \n\nBody weight Millilitres of prepared solution to be injected \nbelow 84 kg Body weight in kg divided by three \n84 kg and above  28 ml \n\n \n• Draw in the volume of prepared solution, while keeping the syringe in the vertical position. If you \n\nhave prepared: \n- one vial with solution, draw up the volume as calculated \n- two vials and your body weight is below 84 kg, draw up in a similar way: \n\na) 14 ml from the first vial \nb) from the second vial, the difference between your calculated volume and the 14 ml from the \n\nfirst vial \n- two vials and your body weight is 84 kg or more, draw up 14 ml from each vial into each syringe \nIf air bubbles appear, minimise as far as possible by gently tapping the syringe and applying gentle \npressure by pushing the plunger into the syringe. Continue to fill the syringe with the volume required. \n\n \n \n\n• Never exceed the volume of 14 ml per syringe. \n• Unlock the syringe(s) by turning it counter-clockwise and discard the vial(s) with adapter. \n• Place the syringe(s) on the work surface, taking care not to touch the surface or any other object with \n\nthe syringe tip. \n \nStep 8: Check prepared syringes \n• Recheck that the volume in the syringe(s) you prepared in step 7 is correct. \n \nAdministration into a vein \nIt is very important that the prepared solution is injected directly into a vein and not into an artery or the \nsurrounding tissue. \nInject the Ruconest solution immediately after preparation, preferably while seated. \n \nStep 9: Required components \n• Check that all required components are on the work surface: \n\n- 1 or 2 syringes with prepared solution \n- 1 infusion set with 25G needle \n- 1 alcohol pad \n- 1 sterile non-woven pad \n- 1 self-adhesive plaster \n- 1 tourniquet \n- 1 plaster for securing the needle \n\n \nStep 10: Preparation of the infusion set \n• Remove the screw cap from the end of the infusion set. This is the end which has no needle. \n• Hold this end with one hand, attach the syringe tip end and secure by turning clockwise until it stops. \n• Hold the syringe with the tip pointing upwards. Gently press the syringe plunger to carefully fill the \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\ninfusion set with the prepared solution. \n\n \n \n• Check that no air is present in the syringe, infusion tube or the needle. \n \nStep 11: Preparing the injection site \n• Position the tourniquet above the injection site – preferably the middle part of the upper arm. Tighten \n\nit to compress the vein. This should be boosted by tightening your fist. \n• Feel, with your other hand, for an appropriate vein. \n• Disinfect the injection site thoroughly with an alcohol pad and let the skin dry. \n\n \n \nStep 12: Administration of the prepared solution  \n• Remove the needle cap. \n• Carefully insert the needle of the infusion set, at the flattest possible angle, into the vein. \n\n \n \n• Secure the needle by applying the plaster, around 7 cm long, over the wings of the needle. \n• Carefully pull back the syringe plunger slightly until you see blood being drawn into the tubing, to \n\nensure that the needle is in the vein.  \n• Release the tourniquet. \n• If there is no blood in the tubing, remove the needle, repeat all steps from beginning of step 11 and \n\nreposition the needle. \n• If blood is present, gently inject the solution into the vein, as shown in the picture. Inject over about \n\n5 minutes. \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n \n \n• If you have prepared two syringes: \n\n- fold over the tubing near the connector of the infusion set to prevent backflow \n- unscrew the empty syringe from the infusion set and immediately replace it with the second syringe \n\n \n \n\n- unfold the tubing and gently inject this solution, similar to the first syringe \n \nStep 13: After administration \n• Carefully remove the plaster for securing the needle and withdraw the needle from the vein. \n• Immediately after removing the needle, press the sterile pad on the injection site for a few minutes to \n\nreduce bleeding. \n\n \n \n• Next, put the self-adhesive plaster on the injection site. \n• Fold down the yellow protection cap over the needle. \n• Safely dispose of the used infusion set with needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty \n\nvial in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of \nproperly. Do not reuse equipment. \n\n \nStep 14: Documenting the administration \nPlease record (e.g. in your diary): \n• date and time of the administration \n• the batch number written on the label of the powder vial \n \nIf you use more Ruconest than you should \nContact your doctor or nearest hospital if this occurs.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf your symptoms get worse and/or you develop a rash, tingling, difficulty breathing or your face or tongue \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nswells up, get medical attention immediately. This may indicate that you have developed an allergy to \nRuconest. \n \nSome side effects may occur during treatment with Ruconest:  \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• Nausea \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n• Abdominal pain, diarrhoea \n• Sensation of tingling, prickling or numbness in the mouth \n• Headache, dizziness \n• Reduced sense of touch or sensation in skin or limbs  \n• Throat irritation \n• Hives \n• Swelling of the ears or the area around the ears \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

By reporting \nside effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Ruconest \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after \nEXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 25°C. \nKeep the powder vial in the vial carton in order to protect from light. \n  \nBefore Ruconest can be administered, the powder needs to be dissolved in the solvent included in the \npackage (see section 3). \nOnce reconstituted, the product should be used immediately.  \nDo not use this medicine if, after dissolving, you notice particles in the solution or if the solution is \ndiscoloured. Small amounts of foam are acceptable. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Ruconest contains  \nPowder vial: \n• The active substance is conestat alfa. Each powder vial contains 2100 units of conestat alfa, \n\ncorresponding to 2100 units per 14 ml after reconstitution, or a concentration of 150 units/ml. \n• The other ingredients of the powder are sucrose, sodium citrate (E331) and citric acid. \n \nSolvent vial: \n• The ingredient of the solvent is water for injections. \n \nWhat Ruconest looks like and contents of the pack \nRuconest is presented as a single glass vial containing a white to off-white powder for solution for injection \ntogether with one glass vial containg a clear, colourless solvent to dissolve the powder. After dissolving the \npowder in water for injections, the solution is clear and colourless. \n \nRuconest is supplied with an administration kit in a carton box containing: \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n- 1 vial of 2100 U powder \n- 1 vial of 20 ml solvent \n- 2 vial adapters \n- 1 syringe \n- 1 infusion set with 35 cm tubing and 25G needle \n- 2 alcohol pads \n- 1 sterile non-woven pad \n- 1 self-adhesive plaster \n \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder: \nPharming Group N.V. \nDarwinweg 24 \n2333 CR Leiden \nThe Netherlands \n \nManufacturer: \nPharming Technologies B.V. \nDarwinweg 24 \n2333 CR Leiden \nThe Netherlands \n \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \n \nPOSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION \n \nPosology \nBody weight up to 84 kg \n- One intravenous injection of 50 U/kg body weight.  \nBody weight of 84 kg or greater  \n- One intravenous injection of 4200 U (two vials). \n \nIn the majority of cases a single dose of Ruconest is sufficient to treat an acute angioedema attack.  \nIn case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose (50 U/kg body weight up to 4200 U) can be \nadministered. \nNot more than two doses should be administered within 24 hours. \n \nDose calculation \nDetermine the patient’s body weight. \nBody weight up to 84 kg  \n- For patients up to 84 kg calculate the volume required to be administered according to the formula below: \n \n\nVolume to be \nadministered (ml)  = \n\nbody weight (kg) times 50 (U/kg) \n150 (U/ml) = \n\nbody weight (kg) \n3 \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n49 \n \n\nBody weight of 84 kg or greater  \n- For patients of 84 kg or above the volume required to be administered is 28 ml, corresponding to 4200 U \n\n(2 vials). \n \nReconstitute each vial with 14 ml water for injections (see section on Reconstitution below). \nThe reconstituted solution in each vial contains 2100 U conestat alfa at 150 U/ml. \n \nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection \nover approximately 5 minutes. \n \n \nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING \n \nPreparation and handling \nEach vial of Ruconest is for single use only. \nRuconest is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution with water for injections. An aseptic \ntechnique should be used for reconstitution, combining and mixing the solutions. \n \nReconstitution \n1. Each vial of Ruconest (2100 U) should be reconstituted with 14 ml water for injections. \n2. Disinfect the rubber stoppers of the powder and solvent vials and put a vial adapter onto each solvent \n\nand powder vial until it snaps onto the vial neck. \n3. Attach a syringe to the adapter on a solvent vial and turn clockwise until it locks. Draw in 14 ml of \n\nsolvent. Unlock the syringe from the adapter by turning counter clockwise. Repeat this step if two \npowder vials need to be reconstituted. \n\n4. Attach a syringe with solvent to the adapter on a powder vial and turn clockwise until it locks. Water \nfor injections should be added slowly to avoid forceful impact on the powder and mixed gently to \nminimise foaming of the solution. Leave the syringe on the adapter. Repeat this step if a second \npowder vial needs to be reconstituted. \n\n5. The reconstituted solution in each vial contains 150 U/ml and appears as a clear colourless solution. \nThe reconstituted solution in each vial should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration. A \nsolution exhibiting particulates or discoloration should not be used. Small amounts of foam are \nacceptable. The medicinal product should be used immediately.  \n\n \nAdministration \n1. Draw in the required volume of prepared solution. Never exceed 14 ml per syringe. Unlock the \n\nsyringe(s) by turning counter clockwise and discard vial(s) with adapter \n2. Attach the infusion set to the syringe and turn clockwise until it locks. Hold the syringe with the tip \n\npointing upwards and gently press the plunger to fill the infusion set with the solution \n3. Disinfect the injection site with an alcohol pad. Remove the needle cap from the needle of the infusion \n\nset and carefully insert the needle into the vein. \n4. Ensure that the tourniquet is released. Gently inject the solution into the vein – inject over about 5 \n\nminutes. \n5. If two syringes were prepared: fold over the tubing to prevent backflow, unscrew the empty syringe \n\nfrom the infusion set (counter clockwise) and immediately replace it with the second syringe. Gently \ninject the solution of the second syringe.  \n\n \nDisposal \nPlease safely dispose of the used infusion set with needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty \nvial in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly. \nDo not reuse equipment. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
