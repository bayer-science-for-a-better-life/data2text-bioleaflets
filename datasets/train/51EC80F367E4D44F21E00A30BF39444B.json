CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nInfanrix hexa is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers against diphtheria, \ntetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. \n \nThe use of Infanrix hexa should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPosology \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses (of 0.5 ml) which should be \nadministered according to official recommendations (see the table below and section 5.1 for schedules \nevaluated in clinical trials). \n \nBooster doses should be given in accordance with the official recommendations, but, as a minimum, a \ndose of Hib conjugate vaccine must be administered. Infanrix hexa can be considered for the booster if \nthe antigen composition is in accordance with the official recommendations. \n \nPrimary vaccination Booster \n\nvaccination \nGeneral considerations \n\nFull-term infants \n3-dose A booster dose \n\nmust be given. \n\u2022 There should be an interval of at least 1 month \n\nbetween primary doses. \n\u2022 The booster dose should be given at least 6 months \n\nafter the last priming dose and preferably before 18 \nmonths of age. \n\n2-dose A booster dose \nmust be given. \n\n\u2022 There should be an interval of at least 2 months \nbetween primary doses. \n\n\u2022 The booster dose should be given at least 6 months \nafter the last priming dose and preferably between \n11 and 13 months of age. \n\nPreterm infants born after at least 24 weeks of gestational age \n3-dose A booster dose \n\nmust be given. \n\u2022 There should be an interval of at least 1 month \n\nbetween primary doses. \n\u2022 The booster dose should be given at least 6 months \n\nafter the last priming dose and preferably before 18 \nmonths of age. \n\n \nThe Expanded Program on Immunisation schedule (at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age) may only be used if a \ndose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. \n \nWhere a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, Infanrix hexa can be used as a replacement for \nsupplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of six weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B \nvaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. \n \nLocally established immunoprophylactic measures against hepatitis B should be maintained. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Infanrix hexa in children over 36 months of age have not been established.  \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nInfanrix hexa is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably at alternating sites for subsequent \ninjections. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nformaldehyde, neomycin and polymyxin. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio or Hib \nvaccines. \n \nInfanrix hexa is contraindicated if the infant or toddlers has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown \naetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In \nthese circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination course should be \ncontinued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B, polio and Hib vaccines. \n \nAs with other vaccines, administration of Infanrix hexa should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous \nvaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. \n \nAs with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section \n5.1). \n \nInfanrix hexa will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae, \nClostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b. \nHowever, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused \nby the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis-\ncontaining vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be \ncarefully considered: \n\n\uf0a7 Temperature of \u2265 40.0\u00b0C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause; \n\uf0a7 Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of \n\nvaccination; \n\uf0a7 Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting \u2265 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; \n\uf0a7 Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \n\nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh \npossible risks. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nAs for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Infanrix hexa or deferring this vaccination \nshould be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a \nsevere neurological disorder. \n\nInfanrix hexa should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n\n \nDo not administer the vaccine intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \n(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Infanrix hexa. Vaccinees with a history of \nfebrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days \npost vaccination. \n \nThe physician should be aware that the rate of febrile reactions is higher when Infanrix hexa is co-\nadministered with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13), or with a measles-\nmumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, compared to that occurring following the administration of \n\n\n\n5 \n\nInfanrix hexa alone. These reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39\u00b0C) and transient \n(see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nIncreased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) and hypotonic hyporesponsive episode \n(HHE) were observed with concomitant administration of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 (see section \n4.8). \n \nProphylactic administration of antipyretics before or immediately after vaccine administration can \nreduce the incidence and intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Clinical data generated with \nparacetamol and ibuprofen suggest that the prophylactic use of paracetamol might reduce the fever rate, \nwhile prophylactic use of ibuprofen showed a limited effect in reducing fever rate. \nThe use of prophylactic antipyretic medicinal products is recommended for children with seizure \ndisorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures. \n \nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not be \nobtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. \n \nClinical data indicate that Infanrix hexa can be given to preterm infants, however, as expected in this \npopulation, a lower immune response has been observed for some antigens (see section 4.8 and section \n5.1). \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very preterm infants (born \u2264 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \nAs the benefit of the vaccination is high in these infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.  \n \nInterference with laboratory testing \n \nSince the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be \nobserved within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm \nHib infection during this period. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInfanrix hexa can be given concomitantly with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PCV10 and \nPCV13), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (CRM197 and TT conjugates), meningococcal \nserogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (TT conjugate), meningococcal serogroup B vaccine \n(MenB), oral rotavirus vaccine and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. \n \nData have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual \nantigens, although inconsistent antibody response to poliovirus type 2 in co-administration with \nSynflorix was observed (seroprotection ranging from 78% to 100%) and the immune response rates to \nthe PRP (Hib) antigen of Infanrix hexa after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were higher if co-\nadministered with a tetanus toxoid conjugate pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine (see section 5.1). \nThe clinical relevance of these observations remains unknown. \n \nWhen Infanrix hexa was co-administered with MenB and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, \ninconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to inactivated poliovirus type 2, \n\n\n\n6 \n\npneumococcal conjugate serotype 6B antigen and to the pertussis pertactin antigen but these data do not \nsuggest clinically significant interference.  \n \nData from clinical studies indicate that, when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccines, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring following the \nadministration of Infanrix hexa alone. Data from one clinical study indicate that when Infanrix hexa is \nco-administered with MMRV vaccine, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring \nfollowing the administration of Infanrix hexa alone and similar to that occurring following the \nadministration of MMRV vaccine alone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The immune responses were \nunaffected. \n \nDue to an increased risk of fever, pain at the injection site, appetite lost and irritability when Infanrix \nhexa was co-administered with MenB vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, separate \nvaccinations can be considered when possible. \n \nAs with other vaccines it may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, an \nadequate response may not be achieved. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Infanrix hexa is not intended for use in adults, adequate human data on use during pregnancy or \nlactation and adequate animal reproduction studies are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines   \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAs has been observed for DTPa and DTPa-containing combinations, an increase in local reactogenicity \nand fever was reported after booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa with respect to the primary course. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nFrequencies per dose are defined as follows: \n \nVery common: (\u22651/10) \nCommon: (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare:  (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000) \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe following drug-related adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies (data from more than \n16,000 subjects) and during post-marketing surveillance. \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Upper respiratory tract infection \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Rare Lymphadenopathy2, thrombocytopenia2 \nImmune system disorders Rare Anaphylactic reactions2, anaphylactoid \n\nreactions (including urticaria)2 \nAllergic reactions (including pruritus)2 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common Appetite lost \nPsychiatric disorders Very common Crying abnormal, irritability, restlessness \n\nCommon Nervousness \nNervous system disorders Very common Somnolence \n\nRare Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-\nhyporesponsive episode)2 \n\nVery rare Convulsions (with or without fever) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Cough \nRare Bronchitis, apnoea2 [see section 4.4 for \n\napnoea in very preterm infants (\u2264 28 \nweeks of gestation)] \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Diarrhoea, vomiting \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rare Rash, Angioedema2 \n\nVery rare Dermatitis \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Fever \u2265 38\u00b0C, pain, redness, local \nswelling at the injection site (\u2264 50 mm) \n\nCommon Fever >39.5\u00b0C, injection site reactions, \nincluding induration, local swelling at the \ninjection site (> 50 mm)1 \n\nUncommon Diffuse swelling of the injected limb, \nsometimes involving the adjacent joint1, \nfatigue \n\nRare Swelling of the entire injected limb1, 2, \nextensive swelling reactions2, injection \nsite mass2, injection site vesicles2 \n\n1 Children primed with acellular pertussis vaccines are more likely to experience swelling reactions after \nbooster administration in comparison with children primed with whole cell vaccines. These reactions \nresolve over an average of 4 days. \n2 Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. \n \n\u2022 Experience in co-administration: \n \nAnalysis of postmarketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions (with or \nwithout fever) and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Infanrix hexa with Prevenar 13 \nto those which reported use of Infanrix hexa alone. \n \nIn clinical studies in which some of the vaccinees received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar \n(PCV7) as a booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever \u2265 38.0\u00b0C was reported in 43.4% of infants \nreceiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of infants receiving the \nhexavalent vaccine alone. Fever \u226539.5\u00b0C was observed in 2.6% and 1.5% of infants receiving Infanrix \nhexa with or without Prevenar, respectively (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The incidence and severity of \nfever following co-administration of the two vaccines in the primary series was lower than that observed \nafter the booster dose. \n \nData from clinical studies show similar incidences of fever when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with \nother pneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nIn a clinical study in which some of the vaccinees received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa \nconcomitantly with measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, fever \u2265 38.0\u00b0C was reported in \n76.6% of children receiving MMRV vaccine and Infanrix hexa at the same time, as compared to 48% of \nchildren receiving Infanrix hexa alone and 74.7% of children receiving MMRV vaccine alone. Fever of \ngreater than 39.5\u00b0C was reported in 18% of children receiving Infanrix hexa with MMRV vaccine, as \ncompared to 3.3% of children receiving Infanrix hexa alone and 19.3% of children receiving MMRV \nalone (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\u2022 Safety in preterm infants: \n \nInfanrix hexa has been administered to more than 1000 preterm infants (born after a gestation period of \n24 to 36 weeks) in primary vaccination studies and in more than 200 preterm infants as a booster dose in \nthe second year of life. In comparative clinical studies, similar rates of symptoms were observed in \npreterm and full-term infants (refer to section 4.4 for information on apnoea). \n \n\u2022 Safety in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy \n \nIn two clinical studies, Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 500 subjects born to mothers \nvaccinated with dTpa (n=341) or placebo (n=346) during the third trimester of pregnancy (see section \n5.1). The safety profile of Infanrix hexa was similar regardless of exposure/non-exposure to dTpa during \npregnancy. \n \n\u2022 Experience with hepatitis B vaccine: \n \nIn extremely rare cases, allergic reactions mimicking serum sickness, paralysis, neuropathy, neuritis, \nhypotension, vasculitis, lichen planus, erythema multiforme, arthritis, muscular weakness, Guillain-\nBarr\u00e9 syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis and meningitis have been reported. The causal \nrelationship to the vaccine has not been established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code: J07CA09 \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa has been evaluated in clinical studies from 6 weeks of age. The \nvaccine was assessed in 2-dose and 3-dose priming schedules, including the schedule for the Expanded \nProgram on Immunisation, and as a booster dose. The results of these clinical studies are summarised in \nthe tables below. \n \nAfter a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule, at least 95.7% of infants had developed seroprotective or \nseropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens. After booster vaccination (post-dose \n4), at least 98.4% of children had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each \nof the vaccine antigens. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPercentage of subjects with antibody titres indicative of seroprotection / seropositivity one month \nafter 3-dose primary and booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa \n \nAntibody \n(cut-off) \n\nPost-dose 3 Post-dose 4  \n(Booster vaccination \n\nduring the second \nyear of life following \n\na 3-dose primary \ncourse) \n\n2-3-4 \nmonths \nN= 196 \n\n(2 studies) \n\n2-4-6 \nmonths \nN= 1693 \n\n(6 studies) \n\n3-4-5 \nmonths \nN= 1055 \n\n(6 studies) \n\n6-10-14 \nweeks \nN= 265 \n\n(1 study) \n\nN=2009 \n(12 studies) \n\n% % % % % \nAnti-diphtheria  \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n100.0 99.8 99.7 99.2 99.9 \n\nAnti-tetanus  \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n100.0 100.0 100.0 99.6 99.9 \n\nAnti-PT  \n(5 EL.U/ml) \n\n100.0 100.0 99.8 99.6 99.9 \n\nAnti-FHA  \n(5 EL.U/ml) \n\n100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.9 \n\nAnti-PRN  \n(5 EL.U/ml) \n\n100.0 100.0 99.7 98.9 99.5 \n\nAnti-HBs  \n(10 mIU/ml) \u2020 \n\n99.5 98.9 98.0 98.5* 98.4 \n\nAnti-Polio type 1  \n(1/8 dilution) \u2020 \n\n100.0 99.9 99.7 99.6 99.9 \n\nAnti-Polio type 2  \n(1/8 dilution) \u2020 \n\n97.8 99.3 98.9 95.7 99.9 \n\nAnti-Polio type 3  \n(1/8 dilution) \u2020 \n\n100.0 99.7 99.7 99.6 99.9 \n\nAnti-PRP  \n(0.15 \u00b5g/ml) \u2020 \n\n96.4 96.6 96.8 97.4 99.7** \n\nN = number of subjects \n* in a subgroup of infants not administered hepatitis B vaccine at birth, 77.7% of subjects had anti-HBs \ntitres \u2265 10 mIU/ml \n** Post booster, 98.4% of subjects had anti-PRP concentration \u2265 1 \u00b5g/ml indicative of long-term \nprotection \n\u2020 cut-off accepted as indicative of protection \n \nAfter a 2-dose primary vaccination schedule, at least 84.3% of infants had developed seroprotective or \nseropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens.

Infanrix \nhexa will confer an anti-PRP immune response (cut-off \u2265 0.15\u00b5g/ml) in at least 84% of the infants. This \nrises to 88% in case of concomitant use of pneumococcal vaccine containing tetanus toxoid as carrier \nand to 98% when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with a TT conjugated meningococcal vaccine (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPercentage of subjects with antibody titres indicative of seroprotection / seropositivity one month \nafter 2-dose primary and booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa \n \n\nAntibody \n(cut-off) \n\nPost-dose 2 \n \n\nPost-dose 3 \n \n\n2-4-12 months of \nage \n\nN=223 \n(1 study) \n\n3-5-11 months of \nage \n\nN=530 \n(4 studies) \n\n2-4-12 months of \nage \n\nN=196 \n(1 study) \n\n3-5-11 months of \nage \n\nN=532 \n(3 studies) \n\n% % % % \nAnti-diphtheria \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n99.6 98.0 100.0 100.0 \n\nAnti-tetanus \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n100 100.0 100.0 100.0 \n\nAnti-PT \n(5 EL.U/ml) \n\n100 99.5 99.5 100.0 \n\nAnti-FHA \n(5 EL.U/ml) \n\n100 99.7 100.0 100.0 \n\nAnti-PRN \n(5 EL.U/ml) \n\n99.6 99.0 100.0 99.2 \n\nAnti-HBs \n(10 mIU/ml) \u2020 \n\n99.5 96.8 99.8 98.9 \n\nAnti-Polio type 1 \n(1/8 dilution) \u2020 \n\n89.6 99.4 98.4 99.8 \n\nAnti-Polio type 2 \n(1/8 dilution) \u2020 \n\n85.6 96.3 98.4 99.4 \n\nAnti-Polio type 3 \n(1/8 dilution) \u2020 \n\n92.8 98.8 97.9 99.2 \n\nAnti-PRP \n(0.15 \u00b5g/ml) \u2020 \n\n84.3 91.7 100.0* 99.6* \n\nN = number of subjects \n\u2020 cut-off accepted as indicative of protection \n* Post booster, 94.4% of subjects in the 2-4-12 months schedule and 97.0% of subjects in the 3-5-11 \nmonths schedule had anti-PRP concentration \u2265 1 \u00b5g/ml indicative of long-term protection. \n \nSerological correlates of protection have been established for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, Hepatitis B and \nHib. For pertussis there is no serological correlate of protection. However, as the immune response to \npertussis antigens following Infanrix hexa administration is equivalent to that of Infanrix (DTPa), the \nprotective efficacy of the two vaccines is expected to be equivalent. \n \nEfficacy in protecting against pertussis \n \nThe clinical protection of the pertussis component of Infanrix (DTPa), against WHO-defined typical \npertussis (\u2265 21 days of paroxysmal cough) was demonstrated after 3-dose primary immunisation in the \nstudies tabulated below: \n \n\nStudy Country Schedule Vaccine efficacy Considerations \n\nHousehold contact \nstudy (prospective \nblinded) \n\nGermany 3,4,5 months 88.7% Based on data collected from secondary \ncontacts in households where there was an \nindex case with typical pertussis \n\nEfficacy study \n(NIH sponsored) \n\nItaly 2,4,6 months 84% In a follow-up of the same cohort, the \nefficacy was confirmed up to 60 months \nafter completion of primary vaccination \nwithout administration of a booster dose \n\n\n\n11 \n\nof pertussis. \n \nPersistence of the immune response \n \nThe persistence of the immune response to a 3-dose primary (at 2-3-4, 3-4-5 or 2-4-6 months of age) \nand booster (in the second year of life) schedule with Infanrix hexa was evaluated in children 4-8 years \nof age. Protective immunity against the three poliovirus types and PRP was observed in at least 91.0% \nof children and against diphtheria and tetanus in at least 64.7% of children. At least 25.4% (anti-PT), \n97.5% (anti-FHA) and 87.0% (anti-PRN) of children were seropositive against the pertussis \ncomponents. \n \nPercentage of subjects with antibody titres indicative of seroprotection / seropositivity after \nprimary and booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa \n \nAntibody \n(cut-off) \n\nChildren at 4-5 years of age Children at 7-8 years of age \nN % N % \n\nAnti-diphtheria \n(0.1 IU/ml) 198 68.7* 51 66.7 \n\nAnti-tetanus \n(0.1 IU/ml) 198 74.7 51 64.7 \n\nAnti-PT \n(5 EL.U/ml) 197 25.4 161 32.3 \n\nAnti-FHA \n(5 EL.U/ml) 197 97.5 161 98.1 \n\nAnti-PRN \n(5 EL.U/ml) 198 90.9 162 87.0 \n\nAnti-HBs \n(10 mIU/ml) \n\n250\u00a7 \n171\u00a7 \n\n85.3 \n86.4 \n\n207\u00a7 \n149\u00a7 \n\n72.1 \n77.2 \n\nAnti-Polio type 1 \n(1/8 dilution) 185 95.7 145 91.0 \n\nAnti-Polio type 2 \n(1/8 dilution) 187 95.7 148 91.2 \n\nAnti-Polio type 3 \n(1/8 dilution) 174 97.7 144 97.2 \n\nAnti-PRP \n(0.15 \u00b5g/ml) 198 98.0 193 99.5 \n\nN = number of subjects \n* Samples tested by ELISA to have anti-diphtheria antibody concentrations < 0.1 IU/ml were re-tested \nusing Vero-cell neutralisation assay (seroprotection cut-off \u2265 0.016 IU/ml): 96.5% of the subjects were \nseroprotected \n\u00a7 Number of subjects from 2 clinical studies \n \nWith regards to hepatitis B, seroprotective antibody concentrations (\u226510 mIU/ml) following a 3-dose \nprimary and booster schedule with Infanrix hexa have been shown to persist in \u2265 85% of subjects 4-5 \nyears of age, in \u226572% of subjects 7-8 years of age, in \u226560% of subjects 12-13 years of age and in 53.7% \nof subjects 14-15 years of age. Additionally, following a 2-dose primary and booster schedule, \nseroprotective antibody concentrations against hepatitis B persisted in \u2265 48% of subjects 11-12 years of \nage. \n \nHepatitis B immunological memory was confirmed in children 4 to 15 years of age. These children had \nreceived Infanrix hexa as primary and booster vaccination in infancy, and when an additional dose of \nmonovalent HBV vaccine was administered, protective immunity was observed in at least 93% of \nsubjects.  \n \nImmunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nThe immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa in infants and toddlers born to healthy mothers vaccinated with \ndTpa at 27-36 weeks of pregnancy was evaluated in two clinical studies.  \nInfanrix hexa was co-administered with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infants at 2, 4 \nand 6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months in three-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=241), or at 3 and 5 \nmonths or 2 and 4 months in two-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=27); and to the same \ninfants/toddlers from 11 to 18 months as booster dose (n=229). \n \nPost-primary and post-booster vaccination, immunological data did not show clinically relevant \ninterference of maternal vaccination with dTpa on the infant\u2019s and toddler\u2019s responses to diphtheria, \ntetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens. \n \nLower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and post-\nbooster (PT, FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with \ndTpa during pregnancy. The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations from the pre-\nbooster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in the same range for infants and toddlers born to \nmothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, demonstrating effective priming of the immune system. \nIn the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of these observations \nremains to be fully understood. However, current epidemiological data on pertussis disease following \nthe implementation of dTpa maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical relevance of this \nimmune interference. \n \nImmunogenicity in preterm infants \n \nThe immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa was evaluated across three studies including approximately 300 \npreterm infants (born after a gestation period of 24 to 36 weeks) following a 3-dose primary vaccination \ncourse at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. The immunogenicity of a booster dose at 18 to 24 months of age was \nevaluated in approximately 200 preterm infants. \n \nOne month after primary vaccination at least 98.7% of subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria, \ntetanus and poliovirus types 1 and 2; at least 90.9% had seroprotective antibody levels against the \nhepatitis B, PRP and poliovirus type 3 antigens; and all subjects were seropositive for antibodies against \nFHA and PRN while 94.9% were seropositive for anti-PT antibodies. \n \nOne month after the booster dose at least 98.4% of subjects had seroprotective or seropositive antibody \nlevels against each of the antigens except against PT (at least 96.8%) and hepatitis B (at least 88.7%). \nThe response to the booster dose in terms of fold increases in antibody concentrations (15- to 235-fold), \nindicate that preterm infants were adequately primed for all the antigens of Infanrix hexa. \n \nIn a follow-up study conducted in 74 children, approximately 2.5 to 3 years after the booster dose, \n85.3% of the children were still seroprotected against hepatitis B and at least 95.7% were seroprotected \nagainst the three poliovirus types and PRP. \n \nPost marketing experience \n \nResults of long term follow-up in Sweden demonstrate that acellular pertussis vaccines are efficacious \nin infants when administered according to the 3 and 5 months primary vaccination schedule, with a \nbooster dose administered at approximately 12 months. However, data indicate that protection against \npertussis may be waning at 7-8 years of age with this 3-5-12 month\u2019s schedule. This suggests that a \nsecond booster dose of pertussis vaccine is warranted in children aged 5-7 years who have previously \nbeen vaccinated following this particular schedule. \n \nThe effectiveness of the Hib component of Infanrix hexa was investigated via an extensive post-\nmarketing surveillance study conducted in Germany. Over a seven year follow-up period, the \neffectiveness of the Hib components of two hexavalent vaccines, of which one was Infanrix hexa, was \n89.6% for a full primary series and 100% for a full primary series plus booster dose (irrespective of the \nHib vaccine used for priming). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nResults of ongoing routine national surveillance in Italy demonstrate that Infanrix hexa is effective in \ncontrolling Hib disease in infants when the vaccine is administered according to the 3 and 5 months \nprimary vaccination schedule, with a booster dose administered at approximately 11 months. Over a six \nyear period starting in 2006, where Infanrix hexa was the principal Hib-containing vaccine in use with \nvaccination coverage exceeding 95%, Hib invasive disease continued to be well controlled, with four \nconfirmed Hib cases reported in Italian children aged less than 5 years through passive surveillance. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEvaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, specific \ntoxicity, repeated dose toxicity and compatibility of ingredients.  \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nHib powder: \nLactose anhydrous \n \nDTPa-HBV-IPV suspension: \nSodium chloride (NaCl) \nMedium 199 containing principally amino acids, mineral salts, vitamins \nWater for injections \n \nFor adjuvants, see section 2. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n6.3 Shelf-life \n \n3 years. \n \nAfter reconstitution: an immediate use is recommended. However the stability has been demonstrated \nfor 8 hours at 21\u00b0C after reconstitution. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package, in order to protect from light. \n \nStability data indicate that the vaccine components are stable at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C for 72 hours. \nAt the end of this period Infanrix hexa should be used or discarded. These data are intended to guide \nhealthcare professionals in case of temporary temperature excursion only. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPowder in a vial (type I glass) with a stopper (butyl).  \n \n0.5 ml of suspension in a pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with plunger stopper (butyl).  \n \nPack sizes of 1 and 10 with or without needles and a multipack of 5 packs, each containing 10 vials and \n10 pre-filled syringes, without needles. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nUpon storage, a clear liquid and white deposit may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the \nDTPa-HBV-IPV suspension. This is a normal observation. \n \nThe pre-filled syringe should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension. \n \nThe vaccine is reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe to the vial containing \nthe powder. The mixture should be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved prior to \nadministration. \n \nThe reconstituted vaccine appears as a slightly more cloudy suspension than the liquid component \nalone. This is a normal observation. \n \nThe vaccine suspension should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the \nvaccine. \n \nThe pre-filled syringe can be supplied with either a ceramic coated treatment (CCT) of the luer tip or \nwith a plastic rigid tip cap (PRTC) luer lock adaptor.   \n\n\u2022 Instructions for use of pre-filled syringe if supplied with a PRTC luer lock adaptor  \n \n\nNeedle \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSyringe \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2022  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022  This vaccine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. \n\u2022 If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Infanrix hexa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child receives Infanrix hexa \n3. How Infanrix hexa is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Infanrix hexa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.   What Infanrix hexa is and what it is used for \n \nInfanrix hexa is a vaccine used to protect your child against six diseases:  \n \n\u2022 Diphtheria: a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. The \n\nairways become swollen causing serious breathing problems and sometimes suffocation. The \nbacteria also release a poison. This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. \n\n \n\u2022 Tetanus: tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that \n\nare more likely to get tetanus infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds that have soil, \ndust, horse manure or wood splinters in them. The bacteria release a poison. This can cause muscle \nstiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. The muscle spasms can be strong enough to \ncause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n\u2022 Whooping cough (Pertussis): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It causes severe \n\ncoughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a \u201cwhooping\u201d sound. \nThe cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also cause ear infections, \nchest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain \ndamage and even death.  \n\n \n\u2022 Hepatitis B: is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It makes the liver swollen. The virus is found in body \n\nfluids such as in the vagina, blood, semen or spit (saliva) of infected people. \n \n\u2022 Polio: a viral infection. Polio is often only a mild illness. However, sometimes it can be very serious \n\nand cause permanent damage or even death. Polio can make the muscles unable to move (paralysis). \nThis includes the muscles needed for breathing and walking. The arms or legs affected by the disease \nmay be painfully twisted (deformed). \n\n \n\u2022 Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib):  can cause brain swelling (inflammation). This can lead to \n\nserious problems such as mental slowness (retardation), cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial \nblindness. It can also cause swelling of the throat. This can cause death by suffocation. Less \n\n\n\n34 \n\ncommonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, heart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes \nand mouth. \n\n \nHow Infanrix hexa works \n\u2022 Infanrix hexa helps your child\u2019s body make its own protection (antibodies). This will protect your \n\nchild against these diseases. \n\u2022 As with all vaccines, Infanrix hexa may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated. \n\u2022 The vaccine cannot cause the diseases that it protects your child from. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before your child receives Infanrix hexa \n \nInfanrix hexa should not be given \n \n\u2022 if your child is allergic to: \n\n- Infanrix hexa or any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).  \n- formaldehyde. \n- neomycin or polymyxin (antibiotics). \n\nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin, rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face \nor tongue. \n\n\u2022 if your child has had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, \nhepatitis B, polio or Haemophilus influenzae type b. \n\n\u2022 if your child has had problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a \nvaccine against whooping cough \n\n\u2022 if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C).  \nA minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nInfanrix hexa should not be given if any of the above apply to your child. If you are not sure, talk to \nyour doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa: \n \n\u2022 if after previously having Infanrix hexa or another vaccine against whooping cough, your child had \n\nany problems, especially:  \n- a high temperature (over 40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of vaccination \n- a collapse or \u201cshock-like\u201d state within 48 hours of vaccination \n- persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination \n- fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination \n\n\u2022 if your child has an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or epilepsy which is not \ncontrolled. After control of the disease the vaccine can be given. \n\n\u2022 if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily \n\u2022 if your child tends to have fits when they have a fever, or if there is a history of this in the family. \n\u2022 if your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the vaccination, please \n\ncontact your doctor immediately. See also section 4 Possible side effects.  \n\u2022 if your baby was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal \n\nbetween breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. These babies may require respiratory \nmonitoring for 48-72h following the administration of the first two or three doses of Infanrix hexa. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \nyour child is given Infanrix hexa. \n \nOther medicines and Infanrix hexa \n\n\n\n35 \n\nYour doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before \nor immediately after Infanrix hexa is given. This can help to lower some of the side effects (febrile \nreactions) of Infanrix hexa. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken, might take any other medicines \nor has recently received any other vaccine. \n \nInfanrix hexa contains neomycin and polymyxin \nThis vaccine contains neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics). Tell your doctor if your child has had an \nallergic reaction to these ingredients.  \n \n \n3.  How Infanrix hexa is given \n \nHow much is given \n\u2022 Your child will have a total of two or three injections with respectively at least 2 or 1 month(s) \n\nbetween each injection. \n\u2022 You will be told by the doctor or nurse when your child should come back for their next injections. \n\u2022 If additional injections (boosters) are necessary, the doctor will tell you. \n \nHow the vaccine is given \n\u2022 Infanrix hexa will be given as an injection into a muscle. \n\u2022 The vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel or into the skin. \n\n \nIf your child misses a dose \n\u2022 If your child misses an injection which is due, it is important that you make another appointment. \n\u2022 Make sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course. If not, your child may not be \n\nfully protected against the diseases. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following \nside effects may happen with this vaccine: \n \nAllergic reactions \nIf your child has an allergic reaction, see your doctor straight away. The signs may include: \n\u2022 rashes that may be itchy or blistering \n\u2022 swelling of the eyes and face \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing or swallowing \n\u2022 a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. \nThese signs usually start very soon after the injection has been given. Talk to a doctor straight away if \nthey happen after leaving the doctor\u2019s surgery. \n \nSee your doctor straight away if your child has any of the following serious side effects: \n\u2022 collapse \n\u2022 times when they lose consciousness or have a lack of awareness \n\u2022 fits \u2013 with or without fever \nThese side effects have happened very rarely with Infanrix hexa as with other vaccines against \nwhooping cough. They usually happen within 2 to 3 days after vaccination. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nVery common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): sleepiness, loss of \nappetite, high temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher, swelling, pain, redness where the injection was given, \nunusual crying, feeling irritable or restless. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nCommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), \nhigh temperature of more than 39.5\u00b0C, swelling larger than 5 cm or hard lump where the injection was \ngiven, feeling nervous. \n \nUncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): upper respiratory tract \ninfection, tiredness, cough, large swelling at the injected limb. \n \nRare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): bronchitis, rash, swollen glands in \nthe neck, armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal \n(thrombocytopenia), in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps \nthan normal between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination, temporarily stopping breathing \n(apnoea), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or \nbreathing (angioedema), swelling of the whole injected limb, blisters. \n \nVery rare (these may happen with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): itching (dermatitis). \n \nExperience with hepatitis B vaccine \n \nIn extremely rare cases the following side effects have been reported with hepatitis B vaccine: paralysis, \nnumbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy), inflammation of some nerves, possibly with \npins and needles or loss of feeling or normal movement (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), swelling or \ninfection of the brain (encephalopathy, encephalitis), infection around the brain (meningitis).  \nThe causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established. \nBleeding or bruising more easily than normal (thrombocytopenia) has been reported with hepatitis B \nvaccines. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.  How to store Infanrix hexa \n \n\u2022 Keep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date refers to \n\nthe last day of that month. \n\u2022 Store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n\u2022 Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n\u2022 Do not freeze. Freezing destroys the vaccine. \n\u2022 Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines your child no longer uses. These measures will help protect the \nenvironment. \n\n \n \n6.

consciousness. these signs usually start very soon after the injection has been given. talk to a doctor straight away if they happen after leaving the doctor's surgery. see your doctor straight away if your child has any of the following serious side effects: collapse times when they lose consciousness or have a lack of awareness fits with or without fever these side effects have happened very rarely with infanrix hexa as with other vaccines against whooping cough. they usually happen within 2 to 3 days after vaccination. other side effects include: very common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): sleepiness, loss of appetite, high temperature of 38 or higher, swelling, pain, redness where the injection was given, unusual crying, feeling irritable or restless. common (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), high temperature of more than 39.5, swelling larger than 5 cm or hard lump where the
