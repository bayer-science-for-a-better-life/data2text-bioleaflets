This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI 650 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\nVEYVONDI 1300 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI 650 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nEach vial of powder contains nominally 650 International Units (IU) vonicog alfa. \n\nAfter reconstitution with the 5 mL solvent provided, VEYVONDI contains approximately 130 IU/mL \n\nvonicog alfa. \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI 1300 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nEach vial of powder contains nominally 1300 International Units (IU) vonicog alfa. \n\nAfter reconstitution with the 10 mL solvent provided, VEYVONDI contains approximately 130 IU/mL \n\nvonicog alfa \n\nThe specific activity of VEYVONDI is approximately 110 IU VWF:RCo/mg protein. \n\nThe potency of VWF (IU) is measured using the European Pharmacopeia ristocetin cofactor activity \n\nassay (VWF: RCo). The ristocetin cofactor activity of recombinant human von Willebrand factor was \n\ndetermined against the International Standard for von Willebrand factor concentrate (WHO). \n\n \n\nVonicog alfa is a purified recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF). It is manufactured by \n\nrecombinant DNA (rDNA) technology in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line without the \n\naddition of any exogenous human-or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, purification or \n\nfinal formulation.  \n\n \n\nThe product contains only trace amounts of human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (≤ 0.01 IU \n\nFVIII / IU VWF: RCo) as determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay for \n\nfactor VIII (FVIII). \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect \n\nEach 650 IU powder vial contains 5.2 mg sodium.  \n\nEach 1300 IU powder vial contains 10.4 mg sodium. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\nThe powder is a white to off-white lyophilized powder \n\nThe solvent is a clear and colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI is indicated in adults (age 18 and older) with von Willebrand Disease (VWD), when \n\ndesmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated for the  \n\n- Treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding  \n- Prevention of surgical bleeding. \n \n\nVEYVONDI should not be used in the treatment of Haemophilia A. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD) should be supervised by a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of haemostatic disorders.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nDosage and frequency of administration must be individualized according to clinical judgement and \n\nbased on the patient´s weight, type and severity of the bleeding episodes/surgical intervention and \n\nbased on monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. Dose based on bodyweight may \n\nrequire adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. \n\n \n\nGenerally, 1 IU/kg (VWF:RCo/VEYVONDI/vonicog alfa) raises the plasma VWF:RCo by \n\n0.02 IU/mL (2%). \n\n \n\nHaemostasis cannot be ensured until Factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) is at least 0.4 IU/mL \n\n(≥ 40% of normal activity). Depending on the patient’s baseline FVIII:C levels, a single infusion of \n\nrVWF will, in a majority of patients, lead to an increase above 40% in endogenous FVIII:C activity \n\nwithin 6 hours and will result in sustaining this level up to 72 hours post infusion. The dose and \n\nduration of the treatment depend on the clinical status of the patient, the type and severity of the \n\nbleeding, and both VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels. If the patient’s baseline plasma FVIII:C level is \n\n< 40% or is unknown and in all situations where a rapid correction of haemostasis should be achieved, \n\nsuch as treatment of an acute haemorrhage, severe trauma or emergency surgery, it is necessary to \n\nadminister a recombinant factor VIII product with the first infusion of VEYVONDI, in order to \n\nachieve a haemostatic plasma level of FVIII:C. \n\n \n\nHowever, if an immediate rise in FVIII:C is not necessary, or if the baseline FVIII:C level is sufficient \n\nto ensure haemostasis, the physician may decide to omit the co-administration of rFVIII at the first \n\ninfusion with VEYVONDI. \n \n\nIn case of major bleeding events or major surgeries requiring repeated, frequent infusions, monitoring \n\nof FVIII:C levels is recommended, to decide if rFVIII is required for subsequent infusions to avoid \n\nexcessive rise of FVIII:C. \n \n\nTreatment of bleeding episodes (On demand treatment) \n\n \n\nStart of treatment \n\nThe first dose of VEYVONDI should be 40 to 80 IU/kg body weight. Replacement levels of \n\nVWF:RCo > 0.6 IU/mL (60%) and FVIII:C > 0.4 IU/mL (40%) should be achieved. Dosing guidelines \n\nfor treatment of minor and major haemorrhages are provided in Table 1. \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI should be administered with recombinant factor VIII if the FVIII:C levels are < 40%, or \n\nare unknown, to control bleeding. The rFVIII dose should be calculated according to the difference \n\nbetween the patient’s baseline plasma FVIII:C level, and the desired peak FVIII:C level to achieve an \n\nappropriate plasma FVIII:C level based on the approximate mean recovery of 0.02 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). \n\nThe complete dose of VEYVONDI should be administered followed by rFVIII within 10 minutes. \n\n \n\nCalculating dose: \n\nVEYVONDI dose [IU] = dose [IU/kg] x weight [kg] \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions: \n\nA subsequent dose of 40 IU to 60 IU/kg of VEYVONDI should be infused every 8 to 24 hours as per \n\nthe dosing ranges in Table 1, or as long as clinically appropriate. In major bleeding episodes, maintain \n\ntrough levels of VWF:RCo greater than 50% for as long as deemed necessary. \n\n \n\nBased on experience from clinical studies, once VWF has been replaced, endogenous FVIII levels will \n\nremain normal or near normal as long as VEYVONDI is continued to be administered.  \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\nDosing recommendations for the treatment of minor and major haemorrhages \n \n\nHaemorrhage \n Initial dose a \n\n(IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight) \n\nSubsequent dose \n\n \n\nMinor \n\n(e.g. epistaxis, oral bleeding, \n\nmenorrhagia) \n\n40 to 50 IU/kg \n\n40 to 50 IU/kg every 8 to \n\n24 hours (or as long as deemed \n\nclinically necessary) \n\nMajor b \n\n(e.g. severe or refractory \n\nepistaxis, menorrhagia, \n\ngastrointestinal bleeding, \n\ncentral nervous system trauma, \n\nhaemarthrosis, or traumatic \n\nhaemorrhage) \n\n50 to 80 IU/kg \n\n40 to 60 IU/kg every 8 to \n\n24 hours for approximately 2-\n\n3 days (or as long as deemed \n\nclinically necessary) \n\naIf rFVIII is administered, see rFVIII package insert for reconstitution and administration instructions. \nbA bleed could be considered major if red blood cell transfusion is either required or potentially indicated or if \n\nbleeding occurs in a critical anatomical site (e.g., intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage). \n\n \n\nPrevention of bleeding/haemorrhage and treatment in case of elective surgery \n\n \n\nPrior to Surgery: \n\nIn patients with inadequate levels of FVIII, a dose of 40-60 IU/kg VEYVONDI should be \n\nadministered 12-24 hours prior to initiating elective surgery (pre-operative dose), to ensure pre-\n\noperative endogenous FVIII levels of at least 0.4 IU/mL for minor and at least 0.8 IU/mL for major \n\nsurgery. \n\n \n\nFor prevention of excessive bleeding in case of elective surgery, within 3 hours prior to initiation of \n\nany surgical procedure, the FVIII:C levels should be assessed. If the FVIII:C levels are at the \n\nrecommended target level of:  \n\n- at least 0.4 IU/mL for minor and oral surgery and \n- at least 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery, \n\na dose of VEYVONDI alone should be administered within 1 hour prior to the procedure.  \n\n \n\nIf the FVIII:C levels are not at the recommended target levels, rFVIII should be administered in \n\naddition to vonicog alfa to raise VWF:RCo and FVIII:C, within 1 hour prior to the procedure. Please \n\nrefer to Table 2 for FVIII:C recommended target levels. The dose depends on VWF and FVIII levels \n\nof the patient, the type and severity of the expected bleeding. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2 \n\nRecommended Target Peak Plasma Levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII:C to be Achieved Prior to \n\nSurgery for the Prevention of Excessive Bleeding During and After Surgery \n\nType of VWF:RCo FVIII:C Target Calculation of rVWF dose (to be \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\nSurgery Target Peak \n\nPlasma Level \n\nPeak Plasma \n\nLevel a \nadministered within 1 hour prior to \n\nsurgery) (IU VWF:RCo required) \n\nMinor \n0.50 – \n\n0.60 IU/mL \n\n0.40 – \n\n0.50 IU/mL \n∆b VWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR c \n\nMajor 1 IU/mL 0.80 - 1 IU/mL ∆b VWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR c \na Additional rFVIII may be required to attain the recommended FVIII:C target peak plasma levels.

If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 0.02 IU/mL \n\nper IU/kg. \n\n \n\nDuring and After Surgery: \n\nAfter the initiation of the surgical procedure, the VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels should be \n\nmonitored and the intra- and post-operative substitution regimen should be individualised according to \n\nthe PK results, intensity and duration of the haemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of \n\ncare. In general, the frequency of VEYVONDI dosing for post-operative substitution should range \n\nfrom twice a day to every 48 hours. Please refer to Table 3 for treatment recommendations for \n\nsubsequent maintenance doses. \n \n\nTable 3 \n\nRecommended Target Trough Plasma Levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII:C and  \n\nMinimum Duration of Treatment for Subsequent Maintenance Doses  \n\nfor the Prevention of Excessive Bleeding After Surgery \n\nType of \n\nSurgery \n\nVWF:RCo \n\nTarget Trough Plasma \n\nLevel \n\nFVIII:C \n\nTarget Trough Plasma \n\nLevel \nMinimum \n\nDuration \n\nof \n\ntreatment \n\nFrequency of \n\ndosing Up to 72 \n\nhours post \n\nsurgery \n\nAfter \n\n72 hours \n\npost \n\nsurgery \n\nUp to 72 \n\nhours post \n\nsurgery \n\nAfter \n\n72 hours \n\npost \n\nsurgery \n\nMinor \n≥ \n\n0.30 IU/mL \n- \n\n> \n\n0.40 IU/mL \n\n- \n\n 48 hours \nEvery 12-24 hrs / \n\nevery other day \n\nMajor \n> \n\n0.50 IU/mL \n\n> \n\n0.30 IU/mL \n\n> \n\n0.50 IU/mL \n\n> \n\n0.40 IU/mL \n72 hours \n\nEvery 12-24 hrs / \n\nevery other day \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of VEYVONDI in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI is for intravenous use. The reconstituted product should be inspected visually prior to \n\nadministration.  \n\n \n\nThe rate of administration should be slow enough to ensure the comfort of the patient, up to a \n\nmaximum of 4 mL/min. The patient should be observed for any immediate reaction. If any reaction, \n\nsuch as tachycardia, occurs that might be related to the administration of the product, the rate of \n\ninfusion should be reduced or stopped as required by the clinical condition of the patient. When co-\n\nadministration of rVWF and rFVIII is considered necessary, they can be pre-mixed in a single syringe \n\nto achieve the appropriate dose. The contents of each vial of rVWF and rFVIII can be drawn into a \n\nsingle syringe by using a separate unused reconstitution device (see section 6.2 for incompatibilities). \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nKnown allergic reaction to mouse or hamster proteins. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nIn actively bleeding patients it is recommended to co-administer a FVIII product with VEYVONDI as \n\na first line treatment and depending on the FVIII activity levels (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nHypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) have occurred.

In case of shock, standard medical \n\ntreatment for shock should be implemented.  \n\n \n\nPatients should be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion \n\nperiod. If signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue \n\nadministration of VEYVONDI and provide appropriate supportive care. \n\n \n\nAdequate medical treatment and provisions should be available for immediate use for a potential \n\nanaphylactic reaction, especially for patients with a history of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI contains trace amounts of mouse immunoglobulin G (MuIgG) and Hamster proteins \n\n(less than or equal to 2 ng/IU VEYVONDI). Patients treated with this product may develop \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to these non-human mammalian proteins. VEYVONDI contains trace \n\namounts of recombinant coagulation factor VIII.  \n\n \n\nThrombosis and Embolism \n\nThere is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly in patients with known clinical or \n\nlaboratory risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, patients at risk \n\nhave to be monitored for early signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against \n\nthromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care.  \n\n \n\nIn patients requiring frequent doses of VEYVONDI in combination with recombinant factor VIII, \n\nplasma levels for FVIII:C activity should be monitored to avoid sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma \n\nlevels, which may increase the risk of thrombotic events. \n\nAny FVIII that would be administered along with VEYVONDI should be a pure FVIII product. A \n\ncombination with a FVIII product containing VWF would pose an additional risk of thrombotic \n\nevents. \n\n \n\nNeutralizing antibodies (Inhibitors) \n\nPatients with VWD, especially Type 3, may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to von \n\nWillebrand factor. If the expected plasma levels of (VWF:RCo) are not attained, or if bleeding is not \n\ncontrolled with an appropriate dose, an appropriate assay should be performed to determine if a von \n\nWillebrand factor inhibitor is present. In patients with high levels of anti-VWF antibodies, von \n\nWillebrand factor therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of VWD patients who have high-titer binding antibodies (due to previous treatment with \n\npdVWF) may require a higher dose to overcome the binding antibody effect and such patients could \n\nbe managed clinically by administration of higher doses of vonicog alfa based on the PK data for each \n\nindividual patient. \n\n \n\nExcipient related considerations \n\nThis medicinal product contains 5.2 mg sodium in each 650 IU vial or 10.4 mg sodium in each \n\n1300 IU vial. This is equivalent to 2.2% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g \n\nsodium for an adult, assuming a body weight of 70 kg and a dose of 80 IU/kg body weight. This is to \n\nbe taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interactions of human von Willebrand factor products with other medicinal products are known. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with VEYVONDI. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nExperience in the treatment of pregnant or breast-feeding women is not available. VEYVONDI should \n\nbe administered to pregnant woment only if clearly indicated, taking into consideration that delivery \n\nconfers an increased risk of haemorrhagic events in these patients. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether VEYVONDI is excreted in human milk.Therefore, VEYVONDI should be \n\nadministered to lactating von Willebrand factor deficient women only if clearly indicated. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals should balance the potential risks and only prescribe VEYVONDI if needed \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThe effects of VEYVONDI on fertility have not been established. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nDuring treatment with VEYVONDI the following adverse reactions may occur: \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions, thromboembolic events, inhibitor formation against VWF. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe table 4 lists the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, post-authorisation safety studies or \n\npost-marketing reporting. \n\nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \n\ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \n\nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4 \n\nSummary of Adverse Reactions reported in Clinical Trials, Post-authorisation safety studies \n\nor post-marketing with VEYVONDI  \n\nin von Willebrand Disease  \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class \n\n(SOC) \n\nAdverse Reaction by \n\nPreferred Term (PT) \n\nFrequency \n\nCategory by \n\nSubject \n\nNumber and \n\nFrequency by \n\nSubjecta \n\n(N=80) \n\nn (%) \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nDizziness Common 3 (3.75) \n\nVertigo Common 2 (2.50) \n\nDysgeusia Common 1 (1.25) \n\nTremor Common 1 (1.25) \n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia Common 1 (1.25) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nDeep venous thrombosis Common 1 (1.25) \n\nHypertension Common 1(1.25) \n\nHot flush Common 1 (1.25) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nVomiting Common 3 (3.75) \n\nNausea Common 3 (3.75) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \nPruritus generalized Common 2 (2.50) \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nChest discomfort Common 1 (1.25) \n\nInfusion site paraesthesia Common 1 (1.25) \n\nInfusion-related reaction \n\n(including tachycardia, \n\nflushing, rash, dyspnea, \n\nblurred vision) \n\nNot known  \n\nInvestigations \n\nElectrocardiogram T \n\nwave inversion \nCommon 1 (1.25) \n\nHeart rate increased Common 1 (1.25) \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Not known  \na Frequency by Subject: Total number of subjects experiencing the AE (related and unrelated) divided by \n\ntotal number of subjects (N) and multiplied by 100. Not known: cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n(observed during post-marketing surveillance). \n\n \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nIn clinical trials, one case of clinically asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported for a \n\nsubject in the surgery study who had total hip replacement. \n\nIn addition, one post-marketing case of DVT has been reported spontaneously for an elderly patient. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nThere is a possibility of developing hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include \n\nangioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, rhinoconjunctivitis, generalised \n\nurticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the \n\nchest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) which may in some cases progress to anaphylaxis (including \n\nshock). \n\n \n\nPatients with von Willebrand disease, especially Type 3, may very rarely develop neutralising \n\nantibodies (inhibitors) to von Willebrand factor. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest \n\nitself as an inadequate clinical response. Such antibodies may occur in close association with \n\nhypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing hypersensitivity or \n\nanaphylactic reactions should be tested and evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn all such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. \n\n \n\nThrombogenicity \n\nThere is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly in patients with known clinical or \n\nlaboratory risk factors including low ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, patients at risk have to be \n\nmonitored for early signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should \n\nbe instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care.  \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nThe immunogenicity of VEYVONDI was assessed in clinical trials by monitoring the development of \n\nneutralizing antibodies against VWF and FVIII, as well as binding antibodies against VWF, Furin, \n\nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) protein and mouse IgG. No treatment-emergent development of \n\nneutralizing antibodies against human VWF or neutralizing antibodies against human rFVIII was \n\nobserved. One of the 80 subjects who received VEYVONDI peri-operatively in clinical studies \n\ndeveloped treatment-emergent binding antibodies against VWF following a surgery for whom no \n\nadverse events or lack of haemostatic efficacy has been reported. Binding antibodies against impurities \n\nsuch as rFurin, CHO-protein or mouse IgG were not observed after treatment with VEYVONDI. \n\n \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo symptoms of overdose with von Willebrand factor have been reported. Thromboembolic events \n\nmay occur in case of major overdose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor von Willebrand factor. ATC \n\ncode: B02BD10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nVEYVONDI is a recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF). VEYVONDI behaves in the \n\nsame way as endogenous von Willebrand factor. \n\n \n\nAdministration of VEYVONDI allows correction of the haemostatic abnormalities exhibited by \n\npatients who suffer from von Willebrand factor deficiency (von Willebrand's disease) at two levels: \n\n- VEYVONDI re-establishes platelet adhesion to the vascular sub-endothelium at the site of \nvascular damage (as it binds both to the vascular sub-endothelium matrix (e.g. collagen) and to \n\nthe platelet membrane), providing primary haemostasis as shown by the shortening of the \n\nbleeding time. This effect occurs immediately and is known to depend to a large extent on the \n\nlevel of polymerisation of the protein. \n\n- VEYVONDI produces delayed correction of the associated factor VIII deficiency. Administered \nintravenously, VEYVONDI binds to endogenous factor VIII (which is produced normally by the \n\npatient), and by stabilising this factor, avoids its rapid degradation. Because of this, \n\nadministration of VEYVONDI restores the FVIII:C level to normal as a secondary effect after \n\nthe first infusion Administration of the FVIII:C rises above 40% within 6 hours and peaks \n\nwithin 24 hours in a majority of patients, depending on the baseline FVIII:C level. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI is a rVWF that contains ultra-large multimers in addition to all of the multimers found in \n\nplasma as it is not exposed to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 during the manufacturing process. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe clinical safety, efficacy and PK data were assessed in 3 completed trials, (070701, 071001 and \n\n071101) which enrolled patients with VWD. A total of 92 unique subjects (80 unique subjects with \n\nVWD in studies 070701, 071001 and 071101 and 12 subjects with Haemophilia A in study 071104) \n\nwere exposed to VEYVONDI during clinical development. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nVEYVONDI in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of von Willebrand Disease (see \n\nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of VEYVONDI were determined in three clinical studies by assessing the \n\nplasma levels of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand Factor Antigen (VWF:Ag), and von Willebrand Collagen \n\nBinding Activity (VWF:CB). In all three studies, subjects were evaluated in the non-bleeding state. \n\nSustained increase of FVIII:C was observed by six hours after a single infusion of VEYVONDI.  \n\n \n\nTable 6 summarizes the PK of VEYVONDI after 50 IU/kg VWR:RCo (PK50) or 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo \n\n(PK80) infusions . The mean duration of infusion was 16.5 minutes (SD ± 3.51 minutes) for 50 IU/kg \n\n(PK50) and 11.8 minutes (± 2.86 minutes) for 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo (PK80). \n\n \n\nTable 5 \n\nPharmacokinetic Assessment of VWF:RCo f \n\n \nParameter Phase 1 PK50 \n\nVEYVONDI with \n\noctocog alfag \n\n(Study 070701) \n\n \n\nMean (95% CI) \n\nSD \n\nPhase 3 PK50 \n\nVEYVONDI \n\n(Study 071001) \n\n \n\nMean (95% CI) \n\nSD \n\nPhase 3 PK80 \n\nVEYVONDI \n\n(Study 071001) \n\n \n\nMean (95% CI) \n\nSD \n\nSurgery PK50 \n\nVEYVONDI \n\n(Study 071101) \n\n \n\nMean (95% CI) \n\nSD \n\nT1/2a 19.3 (14.3; 24.3) \n\n10.99 \n\n22.6 (19.5; 25.7) \n\n5.34 \n\n19.1 (16.7; 21.5) \n\n4.32 \n\n17.8 (12.9; 22.8) \n\n7.34 \n\nClb 0.04 (0.03; 0.05) \n\n0.028 \n\n0.02 (0.02; 0.03) \n\n0.005 \n\n0.03 (0.02; 0.03) \n\n0.009 \n\n0.03 (0.02; 0.04) \n\n0.011 \n\nIR at \n\nCmaxc \n\n1.7 (1.4; 2.0) \n\n0.62 \n\n1.9 (1.6; 2.1) \n\n0.41 \n\n2.0 (1.7; 2.2) \n\n0.39 \n\n2.0 (1.7; 2.3) \n\n0.45 \n\nAUC0-infd 1541.4 (1295.7; 1787.2) \n\n554.31 \n\n2105.4 (1858.6; 2352.3) \n\n427.51 \n\n2939.0 (2533.2; 3344.8) \n\n732.72 \n\n1834.4 (1259.0; 2409.7) \n\n856.45 \n\nAUC0-\n\ninf/Dosee \n\n33.4 (27.2; 39.5) \n\n13.87 \n\n42.1 (37.3; 46.9) \n\n8.31 \n\n36.8 (31.8; 41.8) \n\n8.97 \n\n37.5 (25.3; 49.7) \n\n18.14 \na[hours], b[dL/kg/hours], c[(IU/dL)/(U VWF:RCo/kg)] d[(h*IU/dL)] e[(h*IU/dL)/(IU VWF:RCo/kg)] \nf[VWF:RCo assays with different sensitivity and working ranges were used: Phase 1: automated assay 0.08 – \n\n1.50 IU/mL and sensitive manual assay 0.01 – 0.08 IU/mL; Phase 3: automated assay 0.08 – 1.50 IU/mL \ng This trial was done using ADVATE, a recombinant factor VIII \n\n \n\nAn exploratory analysis of combined data from studies 070701 and 071001 indicated a statistically \n\nsignificantly (at the 5% level) longer mean residence time, a statistically significantly (at the 5% level) \n\nlonger terminal half-life and statistically significantly (at the 5% level) larger AUC0-inf regarding \n\nVWF:RCo following administration with VEYVONDI (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo) and combined \n\nadministration of VEYVONDI and octocog alfa (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg rFVIII) than \n\nafter administration of pdVWF and pdFVIII (50 IU/kg pdVWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg pdFVIII).  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nNo investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and fetal development have been conducted. \n\nIn a human ex vivo placenta perfusion model, it has been demonstrated that VEYVONDI does not \n\ncross the human placenta barrier. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Do not use after the expiry date stated on \n\nthe labels and carton. \n\n- Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the \nreconstitution procedure. Wash your hands and put on clean exam gloves (the use of gloves is \n\noptional). \n\n- Use the reconstituted product (after mixing the powder with the supplied water) as soon as \npossible and within three hours. You can store the reconstituted product at room temperature not \n\nto exceed 25° C for up to three hours. \n\n- Ensure that the VEYVONDI powder vial and the sterilised water for injections (solvent) are at \nroom temperature prior to preparation. \n\n- Use plastic syringes with this product because proteins in the product tend to stick to the surface \nof glass syringes. \n\n- Do not mix vonicog alfa with other medicinal products except for rFVIII. \n \n\nInstructions for Reconstitution and application \n\n \n\n Steps Image example \n1 Remove the caps from the VEYVONDI powder and solvent vials to \n\nexpose the center of the rubber stoppers. \n\n \n2 Disinfect each stopper with a separate sterile alcohol swab (or other \n\nsuitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or haemophilia \n\ntreatment center) by wiping the stopper for several seconds. Allow \n\nthe rubber stopper to dry. Place the vials on a flat surface. \n\n \n3 Open the Mix2Vial device package by completely peeling away the \n\nlid, without touching the inside of the package. Do not remove the \n\nMix2Vial device from the package. \n\nNA \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n4 Turn the package with the Mix2Vial device upside down and place it \n\nover the top of the solvent vial. Firmly insert the blue plastic spike of \n\nthe device into the center of the solvent vial stopper by pushing \n\nstraight down. Grip the package at its edge and lift it off the \n\nMix2Vial device. Be careful not to touch the clear plastic spike. The \n\nsolvent vial now has the Mix2Vial device connected to it and is \n\nready to be connected to the VEYVONDI vial. \n \n\n5 To connect the solvent vial to the VEYVONDI vial, turn the solvent \n\nvial over and place it on top of the vial containing VEYVONDI \n\npowder. Fully insert the clear plastic spike into the VEYVONDI vial \n\nstopper by firmly pushing straight down. This should be done right \n\naway to keep the liquid free of germs. The solvent will flow into the \n\nVEYVONDI vial by vacuum. Check that all the solvent has \n\ntransferred. Do not use if the vacuum has been lost and the solvent \n\ndoes not flow into the VEYVONDI vial. \n\n \n6 Gently and continuously swirl the connected vials or allow the \n\nreconstituted product to stand for 5 minutes then gently swirl to \n\nensure the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake. Shaking \n\nwill adversely affect the product. Do not refrigerate after \n\nreconstitution. \n\n \n7 Disconnect the two sides of the Mix2Vial from each other by \n\nholding the clear plastic side of the Mix2Vial device attached to the \n\nVEYVONDI vial with one hand and the blue plastic side of the \n\nMix2Vial device attached to the solvent vial with the other hand. \n\nTurn the blue plastic side counterclockwise and gently pull the two \n\nvials apart. Do not touch the end of the plastic connector attached to \n\nthe VEYVONDI vial containing the dissolved product. Place the \n\nVEYVONDI vial on a flat work surface. Discard the empty solvent \n\nvial. \n \n\n8 Draw air into the empty, sterile disposable plastic syringe by pulling \n\nback on the plunger. The amount of air should equal the amount of \n\nreconstituted VEYVONDI that you will withdraw from the vial. \n\n \n9 Leaving the VEYVONDI vial (containing the reconsituted product) \n\non your flat work surface, connect the syringe to the clear plastic \n\nconnector and turning the syringe clockwise. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n10 Hold the vial with one hand and use the other hand to push all the air \n\nfrom the syringe into the vial.  \n\n \n11 Flip connected syringe and VEYVONDI vial so the vial is on top. \n\nBe sure to keep the syringe plunger pressed in. Draw the \n\nVEYVONDI into the syringe by pulling plunger back slowly. \n\n \n12 Do not push and pull solution back and forth between syringe and \n\nvial. Doing so may harm medicine. When ready to infuse, disconnect \n\nthe syringe by turning it counterclockwise. Inspect the syringe \n\nvisually for particulate matter; the solution should be clear and \n\ncolourless. If flakes or particles are seen, do not use the solution and \n\nnotify your doctor. \n\n \n13 If you need more than one vial of VEYVONDI to make up your \n\ndose: \n\n• Leave the syringe attached to the vial until an additional \nvial is prepared. \n\n• Use the reconstitution steps above (2 to 8) to prepare the \nadditional vial of VEYVONDI using a fresh Mix2Vial \n\ndevice for each vial.  \n\n \n\n14 The contents of two vials may be drawn into a single syringe.  \n\nNOTE: When pushing air into a second vial of VEYVONDI to be \n\npooled into a syringe, orient the vial and connected syringe with the \n\nvial on top. \n\n \n\n \n\nInstructions for Administration \n\n \n\nInspect the prepared solution in the syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \n\nadministration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from particles). It is not uncommon \n\nfor a few flakes or particles to remain in the product vial after reconstitution. The filter included in \n\nthe Mix2Vial device removes those particles completely. Filtration does not influence dosage \n\ncalculations. The solution in the syringe should not be used if it is cloudy or contains flakes or \n\nparticles after filtration. \n\n \n\n1. Attach the infusion needle to a syringe containing VEYVONDI solution. For comfort, a winged \n(butterfly) infusion set is preferred. Point the needle up and remove any air bubbles by gently \n\ntapping the syringe with your finger and slowly and carefully pushing air out of the syringe and \n\nneedle. \n\n2. Apply a tourniquet and get the infusion site ready by wiping the skin well with a sterile alcohol \nswab (or other suitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or haemophilia treatment center). \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Insert the needle into the vein and remove the tourniquet. Slowly infuse VEYVONDI. Do not \ninfuse any faster than 4 mL per minute. Disconnect the empty syringe. If your dose requires \n\nmultiple syringes, attach and administer each additional syringe of VEYVONDI one at a time. \n\nNote:  \n\nDo not remove butterfly needle until all syringes have been infused and do not touch the Luer port \n\nthat connects to the syringe. \n\nIf recombinant factor VIII has been prescribed, administer recombinant factor VIII within 10 \n\nminutes after infusion of VEYVONDI has been completed. \n\n4. Take the needle out of the vein and use sterile gauze to put pressure on the infusion site for several \nminutes. \n\n \n\nIn case large volumes of VEYVONDI are required, it is possible to pool two vials of VEYVONDI \n\ntogether. The contents of each reconstituted product of VEYVONDI can be drawn in a single syringe. \n\nHowever, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution of VEYVONDI should not be diluted any \n\nfurther. \n\n \n\nThe solution should be slowly administered intravenously (see section 4.2) not exceeding 4 mL/min. \n\nDo not recap the needle. Place the needle, syringe, and empty VEYVONDI and solvent vial(s) in a \n\nhard-walled sharps container for proper disposal. Do not dispose of these supplies in ordinary \n\nhousehold trash. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of \n\nsection 4 for how to report side effects.  \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What VEYVONDI is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use VEYVONDI  \n\n3. How to use VEYVONDI  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store VEYVONDI  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What VEYVONDI is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI contains the active substance vonicog alfa, which is a recombinant human von \n\nWillebrand factor (rVWF). It behaves in the same way as natural human von Willebrand factor (VWF) \n\nin the body. VWF is the carrier molecule for coagulation factor VIII and is involved in blood clotting \n\nmaking platelets stick to wounds and so helps to form a blood clot. Lack of VWF increases the \n\ntendency to bleed. \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI is used to treat and control bleeding episodes and to prevent bleeding during surgery in \n\nadult patients (aged 18 years and older) with von Willebrand disease. It is used when treatment with \n\nanother medicine, desmopressin, is not effective or cannot be given. \n\n \n\nVon Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by the lack or an insufficient amount \n\nof von Willebrand factor. In patients with the disease the blood does not clot normally leading to a \n\nprolonged bleeding time. Administration of von Willebrand factor (VWF) allows for correction of von \n\nWillebrand factor deficiency. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use VEYVONDI  \n\n \n\nDo not use VEYVONDI \n\n- if you are allergic to vonicog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \n\nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before using VEYVONDI  \n\nThere is a  risk that you may experience a hypersensitivity reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) \n\nto VEYVONDI. Your doctor should inform you about early signs of severe allergic reactions such as \n\nincreased heart rate, rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in \n\nbreathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, fast heartbeat, stuffy nose, red eyes,general feeling of \n\nbeing unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If any of \n\nthese symptoms occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, \n\nincluding difficulty in breathing and dizziness, require prompt emergency treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients developing inhibitors \n\nInhibitors (antibodies) against the VWF may occur in some patients receiving the medicine.These \n\ninhibitors, especially at high levels, could cause the treatment to stop working properly. You will be \n\nmonitored carefully for the possibility of having developed these inhibitors. \n\n- If your bleeding is not controlled with VEYVONDI, tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\nIf your plasma VWF or factor VIII fail to reach the expected levels with VEYVONDI based on the test \n\nresults followed by your doctor, or if bleeding is not adequately controlled, it could be due to the \n\npresence of VWF or factor VIII antibodies. This will be checked by your doctor. You might need a \n\nhigher dose of VEYVONDI, or a higher dose of factor VIII, or even a different medicine to control \n\nbleedings. Do not increase the total dose of VEYVONDI to control your bleeding without consulting \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have previously been treated with plasma-derived VWF concentrates you may have reduced \n\nresponse to VEYVONDI due to pre-existing antibodies. Your doctor may adjust the dose according to \n\nyour laboratory results.  \n\n \n\nThrombolism and embolism \n\nThere is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events if you have known clinical or laboratory risk \n\nfactors.Therefore your doctor will monitor you for early signs of thrombosis. \n\nFVIII products may contain varying amounts of VWF. Therefore, any FVIII product that would be \n\nadministered in combination with VEYVONDI should be a pure FVIII product.  \n\nIf you previously had problems with blood clots or vessel occlusion (thromboembolic complications), \n\ntell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nVEYVONDI is not approved for use in children or adolescents below 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and VEYVONDI \n\nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nVEYVONDI is not likely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\nVEYVONDI contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 5.2 mg sodium in each 650 IU vial or 10.4 mg sodium in each 1300 IU vial. \n\nThis is equivalent to 2.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult, \n\nassuming 70 kg body weight and 80 IU/kg body weight. \n\n \n\nThis should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use VEYVONDI \n\n \n\nYour treatment with VEYVONDI will be supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care of \n\npatients with von Willebrand disease.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will calculate your dose of VEYVONDI (in international units or IU). The dose depends \n\non: \n\n- body weight,  \n- the site of the bleeding \n- intensity of the bleeding,  \n- your clinical condition,  \n- the required surgery  \n- the VWF activity levels in your blood after surgery  \n- the severity of your disease \n \n\nYour doctor may test your blood to make sure that you have adequate levels of von Willebrand factor. \n\nThis is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n\n \n\nTreatment of bleeding episodes \n\nYour doctor will calculate the dose that is most appropriate for you, how often you should receive \n\nVEYVONDI and for how long.  \n\nFor minor bleeding (e.g. nose bleed, oral bleeding, menorrhagia), each initial dose is usually 40 to 50 \n\nIU/kg and for major bleeding (severe or refractory nose bleed, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, \n\nCentral nervous system trauma, haemarthrosis, or traumatic haemorrhage), each initial dose is 50 to 80 \n\nIU/kg. Subsequent doses (as clinically required) are 40 to 50 IU/kg every 8 to 24 hours for minor \n\nbleeds as long as deemed clinically necessary and for major bleeds 40 to 60 IU/kg for approximately \n\n2-3 days. \n\n \n\nIf you feel that VEYVONDI is not working well enough, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform \n\ntests to make sure that you have adequate levels of von Willebrand factor. If you use VEYVONDI at \n\nhome, your doctor will make sure that you are shown how to infuse it and how much to use. \n\n \n\nPrevention of bleeding in case of elective surgery \n\nFor prevention of excessive bleeding your doctor will assess the FVIII:C levels within 3 hours before \n\nsurgery. If your FVIII level is inadequate your doctor may give you a dose of 40-60 IU/kg \n\nVEYVONDI 12-24 hours (pre-operative dose) prior to initiating elective surgery in order to raise \n\nFVIII levels to the target level (0.4 IU/mL for minor and at least 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery). Within \n\n1 hour prior to surgery, you will receive a dose of VEYVONDI based on the assessment 3 hours \n\nbefore surgery. The dose depends on VWF and FVIII levels of the patient, the type and severity of the \n\nexpected bleeding. \n\n \n\nHow VEYVONDI is given \n\nVEYVONDI is usually infused into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. Detailed \n\ninstructions for reconstitution and admnistration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nVEYVONDI is not approved for use in children and adolescents below 18 years.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more VEYVONDI than you should \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. If you infuse more VEYVONDI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. There \n\nmay be a risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) in case of an accidental high dose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use VEYVONDI \n\n- Do not infuse a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n- Proceed with the next infusion as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you stop using VEYVONDI \n\nDo not stop using VEYVONDI without consulting your doctor. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine may cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nYou can have a serious allergic reaction to VEYVONDI. \n\n \n\nYou must stop the infusion and contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following \n\nearly symptoms of severe allergic reactions: \n\n- rash or hives, itching all over the body, \n- tightness of the throat, chest pain or chest tightness, \n- difficulty breathing, light headedness, fast heartbeat, \n- dizziness, nausea or fainting. \n \n\nSide effects that have been reported with VEYVONDI that can occur commonly (up to 1 in \n\n10 patients) are: nausea, vomiting, tingling or burning at infusion site, chest discomfort, dizziness, \n\nvertigo, blood clots, hot flushes, itching, high blood pressure, muscle twitching, unusual taste, and \n\nincreased heart rate. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and \n\ncarton. \n\n \n\nUse antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the \n\nreconstitution procedure. Wash your hands and put on clean exam gloves (the use of gloves is \n\noptional). \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nUse the reconstituted product (after mixing the powder with the supplied water) as soon as possible \n\nand within three hours. You can store the reconstituted product at room temperature not to exceed \n\n25°C for up to three hours. Reconstituted product should not be refrigerated. Discard after three hours. \n\n \n\nEnsure that the VEYVONDI powder vial and the Sterilised Water for Injections (solvent) are at room \n\ntemperature prior to preparation.  \n\n \n\nUse plastic syringes with this product because proteins in the product tend to stick to the surface of \n\nglass syringes.  \nDo not mix VEYVONDI with other medicinal products except for rFVIII. \n\n \n\nInstructions for reconstitution \n\n \n\n Steps Image example \n1 Remove the caps from the VEYVONDI powder and solvent vials to \n\nexpose the center of the rubber stoppers. \n\n \n2 Disinfect each stopper with a separate sterile alcohol swab (or other \n\nsuitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or haemophilia \n\ntreatment center) by wiping the stopper for several seconds. Allow \n\nthe rubber stoppers to dry. Place the vials on a flat surface. \n\n \n\n3 Open the Mix2Vial device package by completely peeling away the \n\nlid, without touching the inside of the package. Do not remove the \n\nMix2Vial device from the package. \n\nNA \n\n4 Turn the package with the Mix2Vial device upside down and place it \n\nover the top of the solvent vial. Firmly insert the blue plastic spike of \n\nthe device into the center of the solvent vial stopper by pushing \n\nstraight down. Grip the package at its edge and lift it off the \n\nMix2Vial device. Be careful not to touch the clear plastic spike. The \n\nsolvent vial now has the Mix2Vial device connected to it and is \n\nready to be connected to the VEYVONDI vial. \n \n\n5 To connect the solvent vial to the VEYVONDI vial, turn the solvent \n\nvial over and place it on top of the vial containing VEYVONDI \n\nconcentrate. Fully insert the clear plastic spike into the VEYVONDI \n\nvial stopper by firmly pushing straight down. This should be done \n\nright away to keep the liquid free of germs. The solvent will flow \n\ninto the VEYVONDI vial by vacuum. Check that all the solvent has \n\ntransferred. Do not use if vacuum has been lost and the solvent does \n\nnot flow into the VEYVONDI vial. \n\n \n\n6 Gently and continuously swirl the connected vials or allow the \n\nreconstituted product to stand for 5 minutes then gently swirl to \n\nensure the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake. Shaking \n\nwill adversely affect the product. Do not refrigerate after \n\nreconstitution. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n7 Disconnect the two sides of the Mix2Vial from each other by \n\nholding the clear plastic side of the Mix2Vial device attached to the \n\nVEYVONDI vial with one hand and the blue plastic side of the \n\nMix2Vial device attached to the solvent vial with the other hand. \n\nTurn the blue plastic side counterclockwise and gently pull the two \n\nvials apart. Do not touch the end of the plastic connector attached to \n\nthe VEYVONDI vial containing the dissolved product. Place the \n\nVEYVONDI vial on a flat work surface. Discard the empty solvent \n\nvial. \n \n\n8 Draw air into the empty, sterile disposable plastic syringe by pulling \n\nback on the plunger. The amount of air should equal the amount of \n\nreconstituted VEYVONDI that you will withdraw from the vial. \n\n \n\n9 Leaving the VEYVONDI vial (containing the dissolved product) on \n\nyour flat work surface, connect the syringe to the clear plastic \n\nconnector by attaching and turning the syringe clockwise. \n\n \n\n10 Hold the vial with one hand and use the other hand to all the air from \n\nthe syringe into the vial \n\n \n\n11 Flip connected syringe and VEYVONDI vial so the vial is on top. \n\nBe sure to keep the syringe plunger pressed in. Draw the \n\nVEYVONDI into the syringe by pulling plunger back slowly. \n\n \n\n12 Do not push and pull solution back and forth between syringe and \n\nvial. Doing so may harm the medicine. When ready to infuse, \n\ndisconnect the syringe by turning it counterclockwise. Inspect the \n\nsyringe visually for particulate matter; the solution in the syringe \n\nshould be clear. If flakes or particles are seen, do not use the solution \n\nand notify your doctor. \n\n \n\n13 If you need more than one vial of VEYVONDI to make up your  \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\ndose: \n\n• Leave the syringe attached to the vial until an additional \nvial is prepared.  \n\n• Use the reconstitution steps above (2 to 8) to prepare the \nadditional vial of VEYVONDI using a fresh Mix2Vial for \n\neach vial \n\n14 The contents of two vials may be drawn into a single syringe.  \n\nNOTE: When pushing air into a second vial of VEYVONDI to be \n\npooled into a syringe, position the vial and connected syringe so that \n\nthe vial is on top. \n\n \n\n \n\nInstructions for administration \n\nInspect the prepared solution in the syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \n\nadministration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from particles). It is not uncommon \n\nfor a few flakes or particles to remain in the product vial after reconstitution. The filter included in \n\nthe Mix2Vial device removes those particles completely. Filtration does not influence dosage \n\ncalculations. The solution in the syringe should not be used if it is cloudy or contains flakes or \n\nparticles after filtration. \n\n \n\n1. Attach the infusion needle to a syringe containing VEYVONDI solution. For comfort, a \nwinged (butterfly) infusion set is preferred. Point the needle up and remove any air bubbles by \n\ngently tapping the syringe with your finger and slowly and carefully pushing air out of the \n\nsyringe and needle. \n\n2. Apply a tourniquet and get the infusion site ready by wiping the skin well with a sterile \nalcohol swab (or other suitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or haemophilia \n\ntreatment center). \n\n3. Insert the needle into the vein and remove the tourniquet. Slowly infuse VEYVONDI. Do not \ninfuse any faster than 4 mL per minute. Disconnect the empty syringe. If your dose requires \n\nmultiple syringes, attach and administer each additional syringe of VEYVONDI one at a time. \n\nNote:  \n\nDo not remove butterfly needle until all syringes have been infused and do not touch the Luer \n\nport that connects to the syringe. \n\nIf recombinant factor VIII has been prescribed, administer recombinant factor VIII within \n\n10 minutes after infusion of VEYVONDI has been completed. \n\n4. Take the needle out of the vein and use sterile gauze to put pressure on the infusion site for \nseveral minutes. \n\n \n\nIn case large volumes of VEYVONDI are required, it is possible to pool two vials of VEYVONDI \n\ntogether. The contents of each reconstituted product of VEYVONDI can be drawn in a single syringe. \n\nHowever, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution should not be diluted any further.  \n\nDo not recap the needle. Place the needle, syringe, and empty VEYVONDI and solvent vial(s) in a \n\nhard-walled sharps container for proper disposal. Do not dispose of these supplies in ordinary \n\nhousehold trash. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\n \n\nTreatment of bleeding episodes (On-demand treatment) \n\nDosage and frequency must be individualized based on clinical judgment, taking into account of \n\nseverity of bleeding episode, site of bleeding, patient’s medical history, monitoring of appropriate \n\nclinical and laboratory measures (both VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels). \n\n \n\nStart of treatment \n\nVEYVONDI should be administered with recombinant factor VIII if the FVIII:C levels are <40%, or \n\nare unknown, to control bleeding. The rFVIII dose should be calculated according to the difference \n\nbetween the patient’s baseline plasma FVIII:C level, and the desired peak FVIII:C level to achieve an \n\nappropriate plasma FVIII:C level based on the approximate mean recovery of 0.02 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). \n\nThe complete dose of VEYVONDI should be administered followed by rFVIII within 10 minutes. \n\n \n\nCalculating dose \n\nVEYVONDI dose [IU] = dose [IU/kg] x weight [kg] \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions \n\nAdminister a subsequent dose of 40 IU to 60 IU/kg of VEYVONDI infused every 8 to 24 hours as per \n\nthe dosing ranges in Table 1, as long as clinically required. In major bleeding episodes, maintain \n\ntrough levels of VWF:RCo greater than 50% for as long as deemed necessary. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\nDosing recommendations for the treatment of Minor and Major Haemorrhages \n \n\nHaemorrhage \nInitial Dose a \n\n(IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight) \n\nSubsequent Dose \n\n \n\nMinor \n\n(e.g. epistaxis, oral bleeding, \n\nmenorrhagia) \n\n40 to 50 IU/kg \n\n40 to 50 IU/kg every 8 to \n\n24 hours (or as long as deemed \n\nclinically necessary) \n\nMajor b \n\n(e.g. severe or refractory \n\nepistaxis, menorrhagia, \n\nGastrointestinal bleeding, \n\nCentral nervous system \n\ntrauma, haemarthrosis, or \n\ntraumatic haemorrhage) \n\n50 to 80 IU/kg \n\n40 to 60 IU/kg every 8 to \n\n24 hours for approximately 2-\n\n3 days (or as long as deemed \n\nclinically necessary) \n\naIf rFVIII is administered, see rFVIII package insert for reconstitution and administration instructions. \nbA bleed could be considered major if red blood cell transfusion is either required or potentially indicated or if \n\nbleeding occurs in a critical anatomical site (e.g., intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage). \n\n \n\nPrevention of bleeding/haemorrhage and treatment in case of elective surgery \n\nAssess FVIII:C levels prior to initiation of any surgical procedure. The recommended minimum target \n\nlevels are 0.4 IU/mL for minor and oral surgery and 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery. \n\n \n\nTo ensure pre-operative endogenous FVIII levels of at least 0.4 IU/mL for minor and oral and \n\n0.8 IU/mL for major surgery, a dose of 40-60 IU/kg VEYVONDI may be administered 12-24 hours \n\n(pre-operative dose) prior to initiating elective surgery. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, patients should \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nreceive a dose of VEYVONDI based on the assessment 3 hours before surgery. The dose depends on \n\nVWF and FVIII levels of the patient, the type and severity of the bleeding. \n\n \n\nIf the FVIII:C levels are not at the recommended target, a dose of VEYVONDI alone should be \n\nadministered within 1 hour prior to the procedure. If the FVIII:C levels are not at the recommended \n\ntarget levels, rFVIII should be administered in addition to vonicog alfa to raise VWF:RCo and \n\nFVIII:C. Please refer to (Table 2) for FVIII:C recommended target levels. \n\n \n\nTable 2 \n\nVWF:RCo and FVIII:C Target Levels \n\nRecommended Target Peak Plasma Levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII:C to be Achieved Prior to \n\nSurgery for the Prevention of Excessive Bleeding During and After Surgery \n\nType of \n\nSurgery \n\nVWF:RCo \n\nTarget Peak \n\nPlasma Level \n\nFVIII:C Target \n\nPeak Plasma \n\nLevel a \n\nCalculation of rVWF dose (to be \n\nadministered within 1 hour prior to \n\nsurgery) (IU VWF:RCo required) \n\nMinor 0.5-0.6 IU/mL 0.4 – 0.5 IU/mL ∆b VWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR c \n\nMajor 1 IU/mL 0.80 - 1 IU/mL ∆b VWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR c \na Additional rFVIII may be required to attain the recommended FVIII:C target peak plasma levels.

If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 0.02 IU/mL \n\nper IU/kg. \n\n \n\nDuring and After Surgery \n\n \n\nAfter the initiation of the surgical procedure, the VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels should be \n\nmonitored and the intra- and post-operative substitution regimen should be individualized according to \n\nthe PK results, intensity and duration of the haemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of \n\ncare. In general, the frequency of VEYVONDI dosing for post-operative substitution should range \n\nfrom twice a day to every 48 hours.
