This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLamzede 10 mg powder for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne vial contains 10 mg of velmanase alfa*. \nAfter reconstitution, one mL of the solution contains 2 mg of velmanase alfa (10 mg / 5 mL). \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n*Velmanase alfa is produced in mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant \nDNA technology.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for solution for infusion.\nWhite to off-white powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations in patients with \nmild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis. See sections  4.4 and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients with \nalpha-mannosidosis or in the administration of other enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) for \nlysosomal storage disorder. Administration of Lamzede should be carried out by a healthcare \nprofessional with the ability to manage ERT and medical emergencies.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose regimen is 1 mg/kg of body weight administered once every week by \nintravenous infusion at a controlled speed. For infusion rate see section \u201cMethod of administration\u201d.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \n\nElderly\nNo data are available and no relevant use in elderly patients is described. \n\nPaediatric population \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the paediatric population.\n\n\n\n3\n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor intravenous infusion use only.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nThe reconstituted solution of Lamzede should be administered using an infusion set equipped with a \npump and an in-line low protein-binding 0.22 \u00b5m filter. The infusion duration should be calculated \nindividually considering a maximum infusion rate of 25 mL/hour to control the protein load. The \ninfusion duration should be a minimum of 50 minutes. A slower infusion rate may be prescribed when \nclinically appropriate according to the physician\u2019s judgment, for example at the beginning of the \ntreatment or in case of previous infusion-related reactions (IRRs).\nFor the calculation of the infusion rate and the infusion time based on body weight see the table in \nsection 6.6.\n\nThe patient should be observed for IRRs for at least one hour after the infusion according to clinical \nconditions and the physician\u2019s judgment. For further instructions, see section 4.4. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nSevere allergic reaction to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nThe effects of treatment with velmanase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of \ntreatment considered in cases where no clear benefits could be observed.\n\nAs the accumulation of end organ damage progresses over time, it is more difficult for the treatment to \nreverse the damage or to show improvements. As with other enzyme replacement therapies, velmanase \nalfa does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. It should be considered by the treating physician that the \nadministration of velmanase alfa does not affect the irreversible complications (i.e. skeletal \ndeformities, disostosis multiplex, neurological manifestations and impaired cognitive function). \n\nHypersensitivity\n\nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients in clinical studies. Appropriate medical \nsupport should be readily available when velmanase alfa is administered. If severe allergic or \nanaphylactic-type reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of velmanase alfa is recommended and \ncurrent medical standards for emergency treatment are to be followed.\n\nInfusion-related reaction \n\nAdministration of velmanase alfa may result in an IRR, including anaphylactoid reaction (see \nsection 4.8). The IRRs observed in clinical studies of velmanase alfa were characterised by a rapid \nonset of symptoms and were of mild to moderate severity. \n\nThe management of IRRs should be based on the severity of the reaction and includes slowing the \ninfusion rate, treatment with medicinal products such as antihistamines, antipyretics and/or \ncorticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with increased infusion time. Pre-treatment \nwith antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where \nsymptomatic treatment was required. Patients were not routinely pre-medicated prior to infusion of \nvelmanase alfa during clinical studies.\n\nIn case symptoms such as angioedema (tongue or throat swelling), upper airway obstruction or \nhypotension occur during or immediately after infusion, anaphylaxis or an anaphylactoid reaction \nshould be suspected. In such a case, treatment with an antihistamine and corticosteroids should be \n\n\n\n4\n\nconsidered as being appropriate. In the most severe cases, the current medical standards for emergency \ntreatment are to be observed. \n\nThe patient should be kept under observation for IRRs for one hour or longer after the infusion, \naccording to the treating physician\u2019s judgement.\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nAntibodies may play a role in treatment-related reactions observed with the use of velmanase alfa. To \nfurther evaluate the relationship, in instances of development of severe IRRs or lack or loss of \ntreatment effect, patients should be tested for the presence of anti-velmanase alfa antibodies. In case \nthe patient\u2019s condition deteriorates during ERT, cessation of treatment should be considered.\n\nThere is a potential for immunogenicity. In the clinical studies at any time under treatment, 8 patients \nout of 33 (24%) developed IgG-class antibodies to velmanase alfa. No clear correlation was found \nbetween antibody titres (velmanase alfa IgG antibody level) and reduction in efficacy or occurrence of \nanaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. \nThe development of antibodies has not been shown to affect clinical efficacy or safety.\n\nSodium content\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of velmanase alfa in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). As velmanase alfa aims at normalizing alpha-mannosidase \nin alpha-mannosidosis patients, Lamzede should be used during pregnancy only when strictly needed.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether velmanase alfa or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Nevertheless, the \nabsorption of any ingested milk-containing velmanase alfa in the breastfed child is considered to be \nminimal and no untoward effects are therefore anticipated. Lamzede can be used during breastfeeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no clinical data on the effects of velmanase alfa on fertility. Animal studies do not show \nevidence of impaired fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLamzede has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions observed were weight increase (18%), IRRs (9%), diarrhoea \n(12%), headache (9%), arthralgia (9%), increased appetite (6%) and pain in extremity (6%). \nAll of these adverse reactions were non-serious. IRRs include hypersensitivity in 3 patients and \nanaphylactoid reaction in 1 patient. These reactions were non-serious and mild to moderate in \nintensity. \nA total of 2 serious adverse reactions (loss of consciousness in 1 patient and acute renal failure in \n1 patient) were observed. In both cases the patients recovered without sequelae.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe adverse reactions reflecting exposure of 33 patients treated with velmanase alfa in clinical studies \nare listed in the table 1 below. Adverse reactions are classified by system organ class and preferred \nterm according to the MedDRA frequency convention. Frequency is defined as very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies in patients with alpha-mannosidosis \ntreated with velmanase alfa\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nHypersensitivity(1) CommonImmune system disorders\nAnaphylactoid reaction(1) Common\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Increased appetite Common\nPsychotic behaviour CommonPsychiatric disorders\nInitial insomnia Common\nConfusional state Common\nLoss of consciousness(2) Common\nSyncope Common\nTremor Common\nDizziness Common\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nHeadache Common\nEye irritation Common\nEyelid oedema Common\n\nEye disorders\n\nOcular hyperaemia Common\nCardiac disorders Bradycardia Common\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nEpistaxis Common\n\nDiarrhoea Very common\nAbdominal pain Common\nAbdominal pain upper Common\nNausea(1) Common\nVomiting(1) Common\n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nReflux gastritis Common\nUrticaria(1) CommonSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders Hyperhidrosis(1) Common\nArthralgia Common\nBack pain Common\nJoint stiffness Common\nMyalgia Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nPain in extremity Common\n\n\n\n6\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nRenal and urinary disorders Renal failure acute(2) Common\n\nPyrexia(1) Very common\nCatheter site pain Common\nChills(1) Common\nFeeling hot(1) Common\nFatigue Common\n\nGeneral disorder and \nadministration site conditions\n\nMalaise(1) Common\nInvestigations Weight increase Very common \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications\n\nProcedural headache Common\n\n(1) Preferred terms considered as IRR as described in the section below \n(2) Selected adverse reaction as described in the section below\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nInfusion-related reaction\nIRRs (including hypersensitivity, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, chills, feeling hot, malaise, urticaria, \nanaphylactoid reaction and hyperhidrosis) were reported in 9% of the patients (3 out of 33 patients) in \nclinical studies. All were mild or moderate in severity and none were reported as a serious adverse \nevent. All patients who experienced IRRs recovered.\n\nAcute renal failure\nIn the clinical studies, one patient experienced acute renal failure considered possibly related to the \nstudy treatment. Acute renal failure was of moderate severity leading to temporary discontinuation of \nthe study treatment and fully resolved within 3 months. Concomitant long-term treatment with high \ndoses of ibuprofen was noted as a potentially causative contributor to the occurrence of the event.\n\nLoss of consciousness\nIn one patient, loss of consciousness considered related to the study treatment with recovery after a \nfew seconds was reported. The patient received saline infusion in a hospital setting and was then \ndischarged after 6-hour observation. \nThe patient later experienced epileptic seizures that were considered not related. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety profile of velmanase alfa in clinical studies involving children and adolescents was similar \nto that observed in adult patients. Overall, 58% of patients (19 out of 33) with alpha-mannosidosis \nreceiving velmanase alfa in clinical studies were aged 6 to 17 years at the start of the study.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no experience with overdose of velmanase alfa. The maximum dose of velmanase alfa in \nclinical studies was a single administration of 100 units/kg (approximately corresponding to \n3.2 mg/kg). During the infusion with this higher dose, fever of mild intensity and short duration \n(5 hours) was observed in one patient. No treatment was administered. \n\nFor the management of adverse reactions, see sections 4.4 and 4.8. \n\n\n\n7\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes.\nATC code: A16AB15.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nVelmanase alfa, the active substance of Lamzede, is a recombinant form of human alpha-mannosidase. \nThe amino acid sequence of the monomeric protein is identical to the naturally occurring human \nenzyme, alpha-mannosidase.\nVelmanase alfa is intended to supplement or replace natural alpha-mannosidase, an enzyme that \ncatalyses the sequential degradation of hybrid and complex high-mannose oligosaccharides in the \nlysosome, reducing the amount of accumulated mannose-rich oligosaccharides. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nA total of 33 patients (20 males and 13 females, ranging in age from 6 to 35 years) were exposed to \nvelmanase alfa in five clinical studies. Patients were diagnosed based on alpha-mannosidase activity \n<10% of normal activity in blood leukocytes. Patients with the most severe rapidly progressing \nphenotype (with a deterioration within one year and central nervous system involvement) were \nexcluded. Based on this criteria mild to moderate patients, presenting heterogeneous severity with \nability to perform endurance tests, large variability of clinical manifestations and age of onset were \nenrolled. \n\nOverall effects of treatment were evaluated in the domains of pharmacodynamics (reduction of serum \noligosaccharides), functional (three-minute stair climbing test (3MSCT), six-minute walking test \n(6MWT), and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted) and quality of life (childhood health \nassessment questionnaire (CHAQ) disability index (DI) and CHAQ VAS pain (visual analogue \nscale)).\n\nIn the phase 3 pivotal multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study \nrhLAMAN-05, the efficacy and safety of repeated administrations of velmanase alfa over 52 weeks at \na dose of 1 mg/kg given weekly as intravenous infusion were investigated. A total of 25 patients were \nenrolled, including 12 paediatric subjects (age range: 6 to 17 years; mean: 10.9 years) and 13 adult \nsubjects (age range: 18 to 35 years; mean: 24.6). All but one patient were na\u00efve to the treatment with \nvelmanase alfa. In total 15 patients (7 paediatrics and 8 adults) received active treatment and \n10 patients received placebo (5 paediatrics and 5 adults). The results (serum oligosaccharide \nconcentration, 3MSCT, 6MWT and FVC%) are presented in table 2. A pharmacodynamic effect with \nstatistically significant decrease of serum oligosaccharides in comparison to placebo was \ndemonstrated. The results observed in patients below 18 years of age showed an improvement. In \npatients over 18 years old a stabilisation has been demonstrated. The numerical improvement of most \nclinical endpoints over placebo (2 to 8 %) observed in the year of observation could be suggestive of \nthe ability of velmanase alfa to slow down the existing disease progression.\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 2: Results from placebo-controlled clinical study rhLAMAN-05 (source data: \nrhLAMAN-05)\n\nTreatment with \nvelmanase alfa for 12 months\n\n(n=15)\n\nTreatment with \nplacebo for 12 months\n\n(n=10)\n\nVelmanase alfa \nvs. placebo\n\nPatients Baseline\nactual value\nMean (SD)\n\nAbsolute \nchange from \n\nbaseline\nMean \n\nBaseline\nactual value\nMean (SD)\n\nAbsolute \nchange from \n\nbaseline\nMean \n\nAdjusted mean \ndifference \n\nSerum oligosaccharide concentration (\u03bcmol/l)\nOverall(1)\n\n[95% CI]\np-value\n\n6.8 (1.2) -5.11\n\n[-5.66; -4.56]\n\n6.6 (1.9) -1.61 \n\n[-2.28; -0.94]\n\n-3.50\n\n[-4.37; -2.62] \np<0.001\n\n<18 years(2) 7.3 (1.1) -5.2 (1.5) 6.0 (2.4) -0.8 (1.7)\n\n\u226518 years(2) 6.3 (1.1) -5.1 (1.0) 7.2 (1.0) -2.4 (1.4)\n\n-\n\n3MSCT (steps/min)\nOverall(1)\n\n[95% CI]\np-value\n\n52.9 (11.2) 0.46 \n\n[-3.58; 4.50]\n\n55.5 (16.0) -2.16 \n\n[-7.12; 2.80]\n\n2.62 \n\n[-3.81; 9.05]\np=0.406\n\n<18 years(2) 56.2 (12.5) 3.5 (10.0) 57.8 (12.6) -2.3 (5.4)\n\n\u226518 years(2) 50.0 (9.8) -1.9 (6.7) 53.2 (20.1) -2.5 (6.2)\n\n-\n\n6MWT (metres)\nOverall(1)\n\n[95% CI]\np-value\n\n459.6 (72.26) 3.74 \n\n[-20.32; 27.80]\n\n465.7 (140.5) -3.61 \n\n[-33.10; 25.87]\n\n7.35 \n\n[-30.76; 45.46]\np=0.692\n\n<18 years(2) 452.4 (63.9) 12.3 (43.2) 468.8 (79.5) 3.6 (43.0)\n\n\u226518 years(2) 465.9 (82.7) -2.5 (50.4) 462.6 (195.1) -12.8 (41.6)\n\n-\n\nFVC (% of predicted)\nOverall(1)\n\n[95% CI]\np-value\n\n81.67 (20.66) 8.20 \n\n[1.79; 14.63]\n\n90.44 (10.39) 2.30 \n\n[-6.19; 10.79]\n\n5.91 \n\n[-4.78; 16.60]\np=0.278\n\n<18 years(2) 69.7 (16.8) 14.2 (8.7) 88.0 (10.9) 8.0 (4.2)\n\n\u226518 years(2) 93.7 (17.7) 2.2 (7.2) 92.4 (10.8) -2.8 (15.5)\n\n-\n\n(1) For overall: adjusted mean change and adjusted mean difference estimated by ANCOVA model are \npresented\n(2) By age: unadjusted mean and SD are presented.\n\nThe long-term efficacy and safety of velmanase alfa was investigated in the uncontrolled, open label, \nphase 3 clinical study rhLAMAN-10 in 33 subjects (19 paediatrics and 14 adults, from 6 to 35 years at \ntreatment initiation) who previously participated in velmanase alfa studies. An integrated database was \ncreated by pooling cumulative databases from all studies with velmanase alfa.

No clinical data are available in children below \nthe age of 6 years. \n\n\n\n10\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nLamzede in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of alpha-mannosidosis \ndisease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct.\nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThere were no apparent pharmacokinetic gender differences in patients with alpha-mannosidosis \ndisease. \n\nAbsorption \n\nLamzede is administered through intravenous infusion. At steady-state after weekly infusion \nadministration of 1 mg/kg of velmanase alfa, the mean maximum plasma concentration was about \n8 \u00b5g/mL and was reached at 1.8 hours after the start of administration corresponding to the mean \ninfusion duration time. \n\nDistribution\n\nAs expected for a protein of this size, the steady-state volume of distribution was low (0.27 L/kg), \nindicating distribution confined to plasma. The clearance of velmanase alfa from plasma (mean \n6.7 mL/h/kg) is consistent with a rapid cellular uptake of velmanase alfa via mannose receptors.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nThe metabolic pathway of velmanase alfa is predicted to be similar to other natural occurring proteins \nthat degrade into small peptides and finally into amino acids. \n\nElimination\n\nAfter the end of the infusion, velmanase alfa plasma concentrations fell in a biphasic fashion with a \nmean terminal elimination half-life of about 30 hours. \n\nLinearity/(Non)linearity\n\nVelmanase alfa exhibited a linear (i.e. first-order) pharmacokinetic profile, and Cmax and AUC \nincreased proportionally to the dose with doses ranging from 0.8 to 3.2 mg/kg (corresponding to 25 \nand 100 units/kg).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nVelmanase alfa is a protein and is predicted to be metabolically degraded into amino acids. Proteins \nlarger than 50,000 Da, such as velmanase alfa, are not eliminated renally. Consequently hepatic and \nrenal impairment are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetic of velmanase alfa. As no patients \nolder than 41 years have been identified across Europe, no relevant use in elderly patients is expected. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, juvenile toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\n\n\n11\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nDisodium phosphate dihydrate\nSodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate\nMannitol\nGlycine\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n3 years.\n\nReconstituted solution for infusion\n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C.\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore and transport refrigerated (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C).\nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n10 mL vial (Type I glass) with a bromobutyl rubber stopper, an aluminium seal and a polypropylene \nflip off cap. \nEach vial contains 10 mg of velmanase alfa. \n\nPack sizes of 1, 5 or 10 vials per carton.\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nLamzede requires reconstitution and is intended for intravenous infusion only. \nEach vial is for single use only. \n\nInstructions for reconstitution and administration \n\nLamzede should be reconstituted and administrated by a healthcare professional.\nAseptic technique is to be used during preparation. Filter needles must not be used during preparation.\n\na) The number of vials to be used should be calculated based on the individual patient\u2019s weight. \nThe recommended dose of 1 mg/kg is determined using the following calculation: \n- Patient\u2019s weight (kg) \u00d7 dose (mg/kg) = Patient dose (in mg)\n- Patient dose (in mg) divided by 10 mg/vial (content of one vial) = number of vials to \n\nreconstitute. If the number of calculated vials includes a fraction, it should be rounded up \nto the next whole number. \n\n\n\n12\n\n- Approximately 30 minutes prior to reconstitution, the required number of vials should be \nremoved from the refrigerator. The vials should reach ambient temperature (between \n15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) prior to reconstitution.\n\nEach vial is reconstituted by slowly injecting 5 mL of water for injections to the inside of the \nwall of each vial. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 2 mg of velmanase alfa. Only the \nvolume corresponding to the recommended dose should be administered.\nExample: \n- Patient\u2019s weight (44 kg) \u00d7 dose (1 mg/kg) = Patient dose (44 mg)\n- 44 mg divided by 10 mg/vial = 4.4 vials, therefore, 5 vials should be reconstituted.\n- From the total reconstituted volume, only 22 mL (corresponding to 44 mg) should be \n\nadministered.\n\nb) The powder should be reconstituted in the vial by a slow drop-wise addition of the water for \ninjections down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilised powder. Forcefully \nejecting the water for injections from the syringe onto the powder should be avoided to \nminimise foaming. The reconstituted vials should stand on the table for about 5-10 minutes. \nThereafter each vial should be tilted and rolled gently for 15-20 seconds to enhance the \ndissolution process. The vial should not be inverted, swirled, or shaken.\n\nc) An immediate visual inspection of the solution for particulate matter and discoloration should \nbe performed after reconstitution. The solution should be clear and not used if opaque \nparticles are observed or if the solution is discoloured. Due to the nature of the medicinal \nproduct, the reconstituted solution may occasionally contain some proteinaceous particles in \nform of thin white strands or translucent fibers which will be removed by the in-line filter \nduring infusion (see point e). \n\nd) The reconstituted solution is to be slowly withdrawn from each vial with caution to avoid \nfoaming in the syringe. If the volume of the solution exceeds one syringe capacity, the required \nnumber of syringes should be prepared in order to replace the syringe quickly during the \ninfusion. \n\ne) The reconstituted solution should be administered using an infusion set equipped with a pump \nand an in-line low protein-binding 0.22 \u03bcm filter. \nThe total volume of infusion is determined by the patient\u2019s weight and should be administrated \nover a minimum of 50 minutes. For patients weighing less than 18 kg, and receiving less than \n9 mL reconstituted solution, the infusion rate should be calculated so that the infusion time is \n\u226550 minutes. The maximum infusion rate is 25 mL/hour (see section 4.2). The infusion time can \nbe calculated from the following table:\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\n5 2.5 3 50 53 26.5 25 64\n6 3 3.6 50 54 27 25 65\n7 3.5 4.2 50 55 27.5 25 67\n8 4 4.8 50 56 28 25 67\n9 4.5 5.4 50 57 28.5 25 68\n10 5 6 50 58 29 25 70\n11 5.5 6.6 50 59 29.5 25 71\n12 6 7.2 50 60 30 25 72\n13 6.5 7.8 50 61 30.5 25 73\n14 7 8.4 50 62 31 25 74\n15 7.5 9 50 63 31.5 25 76\n16 8 9.6 50 64 32 25 77\n\n\n\n13\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\n17 8.5 10.2 50 65 32.5 25 78\n18 9 10.8 50 66 33 25 79\n19 9.5 11.4 50 67 33.5 25 80\n20 10 12 50 68 34 25 82\n21 10.5 12.6 50 69 34.5 25 83\n22 11 13.2 50 70 35 25 84\n23 11.5 13.8 50 71 35.5 25 85\n24 12 14.4 50 72 36 25 86\n25 12.5 15 50 73 36.5 25 88\n26 13 15.6 50 74 37 25 89\n27 13.5 16.2 50 75 37.5 25 90\n28 14 16.8 50 76 38 25 91\n29 14.5 17.4 50 77 38.5 25 92\n30 15 18 50 78 39 25 94\n31 15.5 18.6 50 79 39.5 25 95\n32 16 19.2 50 80 40 25 96\n33 16.5 19.8 50 81 40.5 25 97\n34 17 20.4 50 82 41 25 98\n35 17.5 21 50 83 41.5 25 100\n36 18 21.6 50 84 42 25 101\n37 18.5 22.2 50 85 42.5 25 102\n38 19 22.8 50 86 43 25 103\n39 19.5 23.4 50 87 43.5 25 104\n40 20 24 50 88 44 25 106\n41 20.5 24.6 50 89 44.5 25 107\n42 21 25 50 90 45 25 108\n43 21.5 25 52 91 45.5 25 109\n44 22 25 53 92 46 25 110\n45 22.5 25 54 93 46.5 25 112\n46 23 25 55 94 47 25 113\n47 23.5 25 56 95 47.5 25 114\n48 24 25 58 96 48 25 115\n49 24.5 25 59 97 48.5 25 116\n50 25 25 60 98 49 25 118\n51 25.5 25 61 99 49.5 25 119\n52 26 25 62\n\nf) When the last syringe is empty, the dosage syringe is replaced with a 20 mL syringe filled with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n24\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nLamzede 10 mg powder for solution for infusion\nvelmanase alfa\n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Lamzede is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before Lamzede is used\n3. How Lamzede is used\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How Lamzede is stored\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Lamzede is and what it is used for\n\nLamzede contains the active substance velmanase alfa which belongs to a group of medicines known \nas enzyme replacement therapies. It is used to treat patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis \ndisease. It is given for the treatment of non-neurological symptoms of the disease.\n\nAlpha-mannosidosis disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme named \nalpha-mannosidase, which is needed to break down certain sugar compounds (called \u2018mannose-rich \noligosaccharides\u2019) in the body. When this enzyme is missing or does not work properly, these sugar \ncompounds build up inside cells and cause the signs and symptoms of the disease. The typical \nmanifestations of the disease include distinctive facial features, mental retardation, difficulty in \ncontrolling movements, difficulties in hearing and speaking, frequent infections, skeletal problems, \nmuscle pain and weakness.\n\nVelmanase alfa is designed to replace the missing enzyme in patients with alpha-mannosidosis \ndisease. This may improve the symptoms of the disease.\n\n2. What you need to know before Lamzede is used\n\nLamzede must not be used:\n- if you are allergic to velmanase alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before Lamzede is used.\n\n\n\n25\n\nIf you are treated with Lamzede, you may experience a side effect during or immediately following \nthe drip (infusion) used to give the medicine (see section 4). This is known as an infusion-related \nreaction and can sometimes be severe.\n- Infusion-related reactions include dizziness, headache, nausea, low blood pressure, tiredness and \n\nfever. If you experience an infusion-related reaction, you must tell your doctor immediately.\n- If you have an infusion-related reaction you may be given additional medicines to treat or help \n\nprevent future reactions. These medicines may include medicines used to treat allergies \n(antihistamines), medicines used to treat fever (antipyretics) and medicines to control \ninflammation (corticosteroids).\n\n- If the infusion-related reaction is severe, your doctor will stop the infusion immediately and \nstart giving you appropriate medical treatment.\n\n- If the infusion-related reactions are severe and/or there is a loss of effect from this medicine, \nyour doctor will perform a blood test to check for antibodies that might affect the outcome of \nyour treatment.\n\n- Most of the time you can still be given Lamzede even if you experience an infusion-related \nreaction.\n\nOther medicines and Lamzede\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before this medicine is used.\n\nLamzede should be used during pregnancy only when medically necessary. It is not known whether \nvelmanase alfa passes into breast milk. Lamzede can be used during breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nLamzede has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nLamzede contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How Lamzede is used\n\nThis medicine is only to be used under the supervision of a doctor experienced in the treatment of \nalpha-mannosidosis or other similar diseases and should only be given by a healthcare professional. \n\nDosage\nThe recommended dose of Lamzede is 1 mg/kg of body weight given once every week. \n\nUse in children and adolescents\nLamzede may be given to children and adolescents at the same dose and frequency as in adults. There \nis no experience with patients younger than 6 years of age.\n\nAdministration\nLamzede is supplied in a vial as a powder for infusion which will be made up with water for injections \nbefore being given.\nOnce it has been made up, the medicine will be given by infusion pump (drip) into a vein over a \nperiod of at least 50 minutes under your doctor\u2019s supervision. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n\n\n26\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side \neffects occur during the infusion or shortly after (\u201cinfusion-related reaction\u201d, see section 2 Warnings \nand precautions).\n\nWhile under treatment with Lamzede, you may experience some of the following reactions:\n\nSerious side effects\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- loss of consciousness (fainting, which may be preceded by feeling dizzy, lightheaded or \n\nconfused)\n- acute renal insufficiency (kidney problems which can be recognised from fluid retention, \n\nswelling in legs, ankles or feet, drowsiness, shortness of breath or fatigue)\n- hypersensitivity and serious allergic reaction (symptoms including localised or diffuse skin \n\nitching, dizziness, difficulty breathing, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhea or intestinal pain, swelling of the throat, face, lips or tongue)\n\nIf you experience any side effect like these, please tell your doctor immediately.\n\nOther side effects\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n- diarrhoea\n- weight increase\n- fever/increased body temperature \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- low heart beat (bradycardia)\n- psychotic behaviour (mental illness with hallucinations, difficulty in thinking clearly and \n\nunderstanding reality, anxiety), initial difficulty in sleeping\n- confused state, fainting, tremor, dizziness, headache\n- intestinal (abdominal) pain, irritation of the stomach caused by digestive acids (reflux gastritis), \n\nnausea, vomiting\n- pain at the site the infusion is given, chills, feeling hot, malaise, tiredness (fatigue)\n- skin rashes (urticaria), increased sweating (hyperhidrosis) \n- nosebleed\n- joint pain, back pain, joint stiffness, muscle pain, pain in extremity (hands, feet)\n- eye irritation, eyelid swelling (eyelid oedema), eye redness\n- increased appetite\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

Filter needles must not be used during preparation.\n\na) The number of vials to be used should be calculated based on the individual patient\u2019s weight. \nThe recommended dose of 1 mg/kg is determined using the following calculation: \n- Patient\u2019s weight (kg) \u00d7 dose (mg/kg) = Patient dose (in mg)\n- Patient dose (in mg) divided by 10 mg/vial (content of one vial) = number of vials to \n\nreconstitute. If the number of calculated vials includes a fraction, it should be rounded up \nto the next whole number. \n\n- Approximately 30 minutes prior to reconstitution, the required number of vials should be \nremoved from the refrigerator. The vials should reach ambient temperature (between \n15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) prior to reconstitution.\n\nEach vial is reconstituted by slowly injecting 5 mL of water for injections to the inside of the \nwall of each vial. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 2 mg of velmanase alfa. Only the \nvolume corresponding to the recommended dose should be administered.\nExample: \n- Patient\u2019s weight (44 kg) \u00d7 dose (1 mg/kg) = Patient dose (44 mg)\n- 44 mg divided by 10 mg/vial = 4.4 vials, therefore, 5 vials should be reconstituted.\n- From the total reconstituted volume, only 22 mL (corresponding to 44 mg) should be \n\nadministered.\n\nb) The powder should be reconstituted in the vial by a slow drop-wise addition of the water for \ninjections down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilised powder. Forcefully \nejecting the water for injections from the syringe onto the powder should be avoided to \nminimise foaming. The reconstituted vials should stand on the table for about 5-10 minutes. \nThereafter each vial should be tilted and rolled gently for 15-20 seconds to enhance the \ndissolution process. The vial should not be inverted, swirled, or shaken.\n\nc) An immediate visual inspection of the solution for particulate matter and discoloration should \nbe performed after reconstitution. The solution should be clear and not used if opaque \nparticles are observed or if the solution is discoloured. Due to the nature of the medicinal \nproduct, the reconstituted solution may occasionally contain some proteinaceous particles in \nform of thin white strands or translucent fibers which will be removed by the in-line filter \nduring infusion (see point e). \n\nd) The reconstituted solution is to be slowly withdrawn from each vial with caution to avoid \nfoaming in the syringe. If the volume of the solution exceeds one syringe capacity, the required \nnumber of syringes should be prepared in order to replace the syringe quickly during the \ninfusion. \n\ne) The reconstituted solution should be administered using an infusion set equipped with a pump \nand an in-line low protein-binding 0.22 \u03bcm filter. \nThe total volume of infusion is determined by the patient\u2019s weight and should be administrated \nover a minimum of 50 minutes. For patients weighing less than 18 kg, and receiving less than \n9 mL reconstituted solution, the infusion rate should be calculated so that the infusion time is \n\u226550 minutes. The maximum infusion rate is 25 mL/hour. The infusion time can be calculated \nfrom the following table:\n\n\n\n30\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\n5 2.5 3 50 53 26.5 25 64\n6 3 3.6 50 54 27 25 65\n7 3.5 4.2 50 55 27.5 25 67\n8 4 4.8 50 56 28 25 67\n9 4.5 5.4 50 57 28.5 25 68\n10 5 6 50 58 29 25 70\n11 5.5 6.6 50 59 29.5 25 71\n12 6 7.2 50 60 30 25 72\n13 6.5 7.8 50 61 30.5 25 73\n14 7 8.4 50 62 31 25 74\n15 7.5 9 50 63 31.5 25 76\n16 8 9.6 50 64 32 25 77\n17 8.5 10.2 50 65 32.5 25 78\n18 9 10.8 50 66 33 25 79\n19 9.5 11.4 50 67 33.5 25 80\n20 10 12 50 68 34 25 82\n21 10.5 12.6 50 69 34.5 25 83\n22 11 13.2 50 70 35 25 84\n23 11.5 13.8 50 71 35.5 25 85\n24 12 14.4 50 72 36 25 86\n25 12.5 15 50 73 36.5 25 88\n26 13 15.6 50 74 37 25 89\n27 13.5 16.2 50 75 37.5 25 90\n28 14 16.8 50 76 38 25 91\n29 14.5 17.4 50 77 38.5 25 92\n30 15 18 50 78 39 25 94\n31 15.5 18.6 50 79 39.5 25 95\n32 16 19.2 50 80 40 25 96\n33 16.5 19.8 50 81 40.5 25 97\n34 17 20.4 50 82 41 25 98\n35 17.5 21 50 83 41.5 25 100\n36 18 21.6 50 84 42 25 101\n37 18.5 22.2 50 85 42.5 25 102\n38 19 22.8 50 86 43 25 103\n39 19.5 23.4 50 87 43.5 25 104\n40 20 24 50 88 44 25 106\n41 20.5 24.6 50 89 44.5 25 107\n42 21 25 50 90 45 25 108\n43 21.5 25 52 91 45.5 25 109\n44 22 25 53 92 46 25 110\n45 22.5 25 54 93 46.5 25 112\n46 23 25 55 94 47 25 113\n47 23.5 25 56 95 47.5 25 114\n48 24 25 58 96 48 25 115\n49 24.5 25 59 97 48.5 25 116\n50 25 25 60 98 49 25 118\n\n\n\n31\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\nPatient \nweight \n(kg)\n\nDose \n(mL)\n\nMaximum \ninfusion \nrate \n(mL/h)\n\nMinimum \ninfusion \ntime (min)\n\n51 25.5 25 61 99 49.5 25 119\n52 26 25 62\n\nf) When the last syringe is empty, the dosage syringe is replaced with a 20 mL syringe filled with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.

known as enzyme replacement therapies. it is used to treat patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis disease. it is given for the treatment of non-neurological symptoms of the disease. alpha-mannosidosis disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme named alpha-mannosidase, which is needed to break down certain sugar compounds (called 'mannose-rich oligosaccharides') in the body. when this enzyme is missing or does not work properly, these sugar compounds build up inside cells and cause the signs and symptoms of the disease. the typical manifestations of the disease include distinctive facial features, mental retardation, difficulty in controlling movements, difficulties in hearing and speaking, frequent infections, skeletal problems, muscle pain and weakness. velmanase alfa is designed to replace the missing enzyme in patients with alpha-mannosidosis disease. this may improve the symptoms of the disease.",
