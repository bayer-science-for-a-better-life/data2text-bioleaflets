CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nRevolade is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 1 year and above with primary immune \n\nthrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who are refractory to other \n\ntreatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nRevolade is indicated in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the treatment \n\nof thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor preventing the \n\ninitiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nRevolade is indicated in adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either \n\nrefractory to prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nEltrombopag treatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician who is \n\nexperienced in the treatment of haematological diseases or the management of chronic hepatitis C and \n\nits complications. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nEltrombopag dosing requirements must be individualised based on the patient\u2019s platelet counts. The \n\nobjective of treatment with eltrombopag should not be to normalise platelet counts. \n\n \n\nThe powder for oral suspension may lead to higher eltrombopag exposure than the tablet formulation \n\n(see section 5.2). When switching between the tablet and powder for oral suspension formulations, \n\nplatelet counts should be monitored weekly for 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nImmune (primary) thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nThe lowest dose of eltrombopag to achieve and maintain a platelet count \u226550,000/\u00b5l should be used. \n\nDose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response. Eltrombopag must not be used to \n\nnormalise platelet counts. In clinical studies, platelet counts generally increased within 1 to 2 weeks \n\nafter starting eltrombopag and decreased within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation. \n\n \n\nAdults and paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years \n\nThe recommended starting dose of eltrombopag is 50 mg once daily. For patients of Asian ancestry \n\n(such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean or Thai), eltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced \n\ndose of 25 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population aged 1 to 5 years \n\nThe recommended starting dose of eltrombopag is 25 mg once daily. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nMonitoring and dose adjustment \n\nAfter initiating eltrombopag, the dose must be adjusted to achieve and maintain a platelet count \n\n\u226550,000/\u00b5l as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding. A daily dose of 75 mg must not be exceeded. \n\n \n\nClinical haematology and liver tests should be monitored regularly throughout therapy with \n\neltrombopag and the dose regimen of eltrombopag modified based on platelet counts as outlined in \n\nTable 1. During therapy with eltrombopag full blood counts (FBCs), including platelet count and \n\nperipheral blood smears, should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count (\u226550,000/\u00b5l for at \n\nleast 4 weeks) has been achieved. FBCs including platelet counts and peripheral blood smears should \n\nbe obtained monthly thereafter. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in ITP patients \n\n \n\nPlatelet count Dose adjustment or response \n\n<50,000/\u00b5l following at least \n\n2 weeks of therapy \n\nIncrease daily dose by 25 mg to a maximum of 75 mg/day*. \n\n\uf0b350,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3150,000/\u00b5l Use lowest dose of eltrombopag and/or concomitant ITP \n\ntreatment to maintain platelet counts that avoid or reduce \n\nbleeding. \n\n>150,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3250,000/\u00b5l Decrease the daily dose by 25 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the \n\neffects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments\u2666. \n\n>250,000/\u00b5l Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring \n\nto twice weekly. \n\n \n\nOnce the platelet count is \u2264 100,000/\u00b5l, reinitiate therapy at a \n\ndaily dose reduced by 25 mg. \n\n* For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once every other day, increase dose to 25 mg once daily. \n\n\u2666 For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once daily, consideration should be given to dosing at \n\n12.5 mg once daily or alternatively a dose of 25 mg once every other day. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag can be administered in addition to other ITP medicinal products. The dose regimen of \n\nconcomitant ITP medicinal products should be modified, as medically appropriate, to avoid excessive \n\nincreases in platelet counts during therapy with eltrombopag. \n\n \n\nIt is necessary to wait for at least 2 weeks to see the effect of any dose adjustment on the patient\u2019s \n\nplatelet response prior to considering another dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nThe standard eltrombopag dose adjustment, either decrease or increase, would be 25 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nTreatment with eltrombopag should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level \n\nsufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 75 mg once \n\ndaily. \n\n \n\nPatients should be clinically evaluated periodically and continuation of treatment should be decided on \n\nan individual basis by the treating physician. In non-splenectomised patients this should include \n\nevaluation relative to splenectomy. The reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia is possible upon \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nChronic hepatitis C (HCV) associated thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nWhen eltrombopag is given in combination with antivirals reference should be made to the full \n\nsummary of product characteristics of the respective coadministered medicinal products for \n\ncomprehensive details of relevant safety information or contraindications. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, platelet counts generally began to increase within 1 week of starting eltrombopag. \n\nThe aim of treatment with eltrombopag should be to achieve the minimum level of platelet counts \n\n\n\n5 \n\nneeded to initiate antiviral therapy, in adherence to clinical practice recommendations. During antiviral \n\ntherapy, the aim of treatment should be to keep platelet counts at a level that prevents the risk of \n\nbleeding complications, normally around 50,000-75,000/\u00b5l. Platelet counts >75,000/\u00b5l should be \n\navoided. The lowest dose of eltrombopag needed to achieve the targets should be used. Dose \n\nadjustments are based upon the platelet count response. \n\n \n\nInitial dose regimen \n\nEltrombopag should be initiated at a dose of 25 mg once daily. No dosage adjustment is necessary for \n\nHCV patients of East Asian ancestry or patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMonitoring and dose adjustment \n\nThe dose of eltrombopag should be adjusted in 25 mg increments every 2 weeks as necessary to \n\nachieve the target platelet count required to initiate antiviral therapy. Platelet counts should be \n\nmonitored every week prior to starting antiviral therapy. On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet \n\ncount may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose adjustments should be avoided (see Table 2). \n\n \n\nDuring antiviral therapy, the dose of eltrombopag should be adjusted as necessary to avoid dose \n\nreductions of peginterferon due to decreasing platelet counts that may put patients at risk of bleeding \n\n(see Table 2). Platelet counts should be monitored weekly during antiviral therapy until a stable \n\nplatelet count is achieved, normally around 50,000-75,000/\u00b5l. FBCs including platelet counts and \n\nperipheral blood smears should be obtained monthly thereafter. Dose reductions on the daily dose by \n\n25 mg should be considered if platelet counts exceed the required target. It is recommended to wait for \n\n2 weeks to assess the effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments. \n\n \n\nA dose of 100 mg eltrombopag once daily must not be exceeded. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in HCV patients during antiviral therapy \n\n \n\nPlatelet count Dose adjustment or response \n\n<50,000/\u00b5l following at least \n\n2 weeks of therapy \n\nIncrease daily dose by 25 mg to a maximum of 100 mg/day. \n\n\u226550,000/\u00b5l to \u2264100,000/\u00b5l Use lowest dose of eltrombopag as necessary to avoid dose \n\nreductions of peginterferon. \n\n>100,000/\u00b5l to \u2264150,000/\u00b5l Decrease the daily dose by 25 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the \n\neffects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments\u2666. \n\n>150,000/\u00b5l Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring to \n\ntwice weekly. \n\n \n\nOnce the platelet count is \u2264100,000/\u00b5l, reinitiate therapy at a daily \n\ndose reduced by 25 mg*. \n\n* For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once daily, consideration should be given to reinitiating \n\ndosing at 25 mg every other day. \n\u2666 On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet count may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose \n\nreductions should be avoided. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nIf after 2 weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 100 mg the required platelet level to initiate antiviral \n\ntherapy is not achieved, eltrombopag should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag treatment should be terminated when antiviral therapy is discontinued unless otherwise \n\njustified. Excessive platelet count responses or important liver test abnormalities also necessitate \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSevere aplastic anaemia \n\n \n\nInitial dose regimen \n\nEltrombopag should be initiated at a dose of 50 mg once daily. For patients of Asian ancestry, \n\neltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily (see section 5.2). The treatment \n\nshould not be initiated when the patients has existing cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 7. \n\n \n\nMonitoring and dose adjustment \n\nHaematological response requires dose titration, generally up to 150 mg, and may take up to 16 weeks \n\nafter starting eltrombopag (see section 5.1). The dose of eltrombopag should be adjusted in 50 mg \n\nincrements every 2 weeks as necessary to achieve the target platelet count \u226550,000/\u00b5l. For patients \n\ntaking 25 mg once daily, the dose should be increased to 50 mg daily before increasing the dose \n\namount by 50 mg. A dose of 150 mg daily must not be exceeded. Clinical haematology and liver tests \n\nshould be monitored regularly throughout therapy with eltrombopag and the dosage regimen of \n\neltrombopag modified based on platelet counts as outlined in Table 3. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in patients with severe aplastic anaemia \n\n \n\nPlatelet count Dose adjustment or response \n\n<50,000/\u00b5l following at least \n\n2 weeks of therapy \n\nIncrease daily dose by 50 mg to a maximum of 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nFor patients taking 25 mg once daily, increase the dose to \n\n50 mg daily before increasing the dose amount by 50 mg. \n\n\uf0b350,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3150,000/\u00b5l Use lowest dose of eltrombopag to maintain platelet counts. \n\n>150,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3250,000/\u00b5l Decrease the daily dose by 50 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the \n\neffects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments. \n\n>250,000/\u00b5l Stop eltrombopag; for at least one week. \n\n \n\nOnce the platelet count is \u2264100,000/\u00b5l, reinitiate therapy at a \n\ndaily dose reduced by 50 mg. \n\n \n\nTapering for tri-lineage (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) responders \n\nFor patients who achieve tri-lineage response, including transfusion independence, lasting at least \n\n8 weeks: the dose of eltrombopag may be reduced by 50%. \n\n \n\nIf counts remain stable after 8 weeks at the reduced dose, then eltrombopag must be discontinued and \n\nblood counts monitored. If platelet counts drop to <30,000/\u00b5l, haemoglobin drops to < 9 g/dl or \n\nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 109/l, eltrombopag may be reinitiated at the previous effective \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nIf no haematological response has occurred after 16 weeks of therapy with eltrombopag, therapy \n\nshould be discontinued. If new cytogenetic abnormalities are detected, it must be evaluated whether \n\ncontinuation of eltrombopag is appropriate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Excessive platelet count \n\nresponses (as outlined in Table 3) or important liver test abnormalities also necessitate discontinuation \n\nof eltrombopag (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Patients with impaired renal \n\nfunction should use eltrombopag with caution and close monitoring, for example by testing serum \n\ncreatinine and/or performing urine analysis (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nEltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22655) unless \n\nthe expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIf the use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary for ITP patients with hepatic impairment the starting \n\ndose must be 25 mg once daily. After initiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment an interval of 3 weeks should be observed before increasing the dose. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV and mild hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh score \u22646). Chronic HCV patients and severe aplastic anaemia patients with \n\nhepatic impairment should initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily (see section 5.2). After \n\ninitiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic impairment an interval of 2 weeks should be \n\nobserved before increasing the dose. \n\n \n\nThere is an increased risk for adverse events, including hepatic decompensation and thromboembolic \n\nevents, in thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic liver disease treated with eltrombopag, \n\neither in preparation for invasive procedure or in HCV patients undergoing antiviral therapy (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThere are limited data on the use of eltrombopag in ITP patients aged 65 years and older and no \n\nclinical experience in ITP patients aged over 85 years. In the clinical studies of eltrombopag, overall \n\nno clinically significant differences in safety of eltrombopag were observed between patients aged at \n\nleast 65 years and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in \n\nresponses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals \n\ncannot be ruled out (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere are limited data on the use of eltrombopag in HCV and SAA patients aged over 75 years. \n\nCaution should be exercised in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAsian patients \n\nFor patients of Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean or Thai), including \n\nthose with hepatic impairment, eltrombopag should be initiated at a dose of 25 mg once daily (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatient platelet count should continue to be monitored and the standard criteria for further dose \n\nmodification followed. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nRevolade is not recommended for use in children under the age of one year with ITP due to \n\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy. The safety and efficacy of eltrombopag has not been \n\nestablished in children and adolescents (<18 years) with chronic HCV related thrombocytopenia or \n\nSAA. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\nThe tablets should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as antacids, \n\ndairy products (or other calcium containing food products), or mineral supplements containing \n\npolyvalent cations (e.g. iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc) (see sections 4.5 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to eltrombopag or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThere is an increased risk for adverse reactions, including potentially fatal hepatic decompensation and \n\nthromboembolic events, in thrombocytopenic HCV patients with advanced chronic liver disease, as \n\ndefined by low albumin levels \u226435 g/l or model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score \u226510, when \n\ntreated with eltrombopag in combination with interferon-based therapy. In addition, the benefits of \n\ntreatment in terms of the proportion achieving sustained virological response (SVR) compared with \n\nplacebo were modest in these patients (especially for those with baseline albumin \u226435g/l) compared \n\nwith the group overall. Treatment with eltrombopag in these patients should be initiated only by \n\nphysicians experienced in the management of advanced HCV, and only when the risks of \n\nthrombocytopenia or withholding antiviral therapy necessitate intervention. If treatment is considered \n\nclinically indicated, close monitoring of these patients is required. \n\n \n\nCombination with direct-acting antiviral agents \n\n \n\nSafety and efficacy have not been established in combination with direct-acting antiviral agents \n\napproved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. \n\n \n\nRisk of hepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag administration can cause abnormal liver function and severe hepatotoxicity, which might \n\nbe life-threatening (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSerum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) and bilirubin should be \n\nmeasured prior to initiation of eltrombopag, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase and \n\nmonthly following establishment of a stable dose. Eltrombopag inhibits UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, \n\nwhich may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinaemia. If bilirubin is elevated fractionation should be \n\nperformed. Abnormal serum liver tests should be evaluated with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If \n\nthe abnormalities are confirmed, serum liver tests should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve, \n\nstabilise, or return to baseline levels. Eltrombopag should be discontinued if ALT levels increase \n\n(\uf0b33 times the upper limit of normal [x ULN] in patients with normal liver function, or \u22653 x baseline or \n\n>5 x ULN, whichever is the lower, in patients with pre-treatment elevations in transaminases) and are: \n\n\uf0b7 progressive, or \n\n\uf0b7 persistent for \u22654 weeks, or \n\n\uf0b7 accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or \n\n\uf0b7 accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. \n \n\nCaution is required when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic disease. In ITP and SAA \n\npatients a lower starting dose of eltrombopag should be used. Close monitoring is required when \n\nadministering to patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic decompensation (use with interferon) \n\n \n\nHepatic decompensation in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Monitoring is required in patients with \n\nlow albumin levels (\u226435 g/l) or with MELD score \u226510 at baseline. \n\n \n\nChronic HCV patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving alfa \n\ninterferon therapy. In 2 controlled clinical studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV, hepatic \n\ndecompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial \n\nperitonitis) occurred more frequently in the eltrombopag arm (11%) than in the placebo arm (6%). In \n\npatients with low albumin levels (\u2264 35 g/l) or with a MELD score \u226510 at baseline, there was a 3-fold \n\ngreater risk of hepatic decompensation and an increase in the risk of a fatal adverse event compared to \n\nthose with less advanced liver disease. In addition, the benefits of treatment in terms of the proportion \n\n\n\n9 \n\nachieving SVR compared with placebo were modest in these patients (especially for those with \n\nbaseline albumin \u226435 g/l) compared with the group overall. Eltrombopag should only be administered \n\nto such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. \n\nPatients with these characteristics should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic \n\ndecompensation. The respective interferon summary of product characteristics should be referenced \n\nfor discontinuation criteria. Eltrombopag should be terminated if antiviral therapy is discontinued for \n\nhepatic decompensation. \n\n \n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic complications \n\n \n\nIn controlled studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV receiving interferon-based therapy \n\n(n=1,439), 38 out of 955 patients (4%) treated with eltrombopag and 6 out of 484 patients (1%) in the \n\nplacebo group experienced thromboembolic events (TEEs). Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic \n\ncomplications included both venous and arterial events. The majority of TEEs were non-serious and \n\nresolved by the end of the study. Portal vein thrombosis was the most common TEE in both treatment \n\ngroups (2% in patients treated with eltrombopag versus <1% for placebo). No specific temporal \n\nrelationship between start of treatment and event of TEE were observed. Patients with low albumin \n\nlevels (\u226435 g/l) or MELD \u226510 had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs than those with higher albumin levels; \n\nthose aged \u226560 years had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs compared to younger patients. Eltrombopag \n\nshould only be administered to such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in \n\ncomparison with the risks. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of TEE. \n\n \n\nThe risk of TEEs has been found to be increased in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) treated \n\nwith 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures. Six of 143 \n\n(4%) adult patients with CLD receiving eltrombopag experienced TEEs (all of the portal venous \n\nsystem) and 2 of 145 (1%) patients in the placebo group experienced TEEs (one in the portal venous \n\nsystem and one myocardial infarction). Five of the 6 patients treated with eltrombopag experienced the \n\nthrombotic complication at a platelet count >200,000/\u00b5l and within 30 days of the last dose of \n\neltrombopag. Eltrombopag is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with \n\nchronic liver disease in preparation for invasive procedures. \n\n \n\nIn eltrombopag clinical studies in ITP thromboembolic events were observed at low and normal \n\nplatelet counts. Caution should be used when administering eltrombopag to patients with known risk \n\nfactors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. Factor V Leiden) or acquired \n\nrisk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), advanced age, patients with prolonged \n\nperiods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, \n\nsurgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. Platelet counts should be closely monitored and consideration \n\ngiven to reducing the dose or discontinuing eltrombopag treatment if the platelet count exceeds the \n\ntarget levels (see section 4.2). The risk-benefit balance should be considered in patients at risk of TEEs \n\nof any aetiology. \n\n \n\nNo case of TEE was identified from a clinical study in refractory SAA, however the risk of these \n\nevents cannot be excluded in this patient population due to the limited number of exposed patients. As \n\nthe highest authorised dose is indicated for patients with SAA (150 mg/day) and due to the nature of \n\nthe reaction, TEEs might be expected in this patient population. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22655) unless \n\nthe expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis. When treatment is \n\nconsidered appropriate, caution is required when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBleeding following discontinuation of eltrombopag \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia is likely to reoccur in ITP patients upon discontinuation of treatment with \n\neltrombopag. Following discontinuation of eltrombopag, platelet counts return to baseline levels \n\nwithin 2 weeks in the majority of patients, which increases the bleeding risk and in some cases may \n\nlead to bleeding. This risk is increased if eltrombopag treatment is discontinued in the presence of \n\nanticoagulants or anti-platelet agents. It is recommended that, if treatment with eltrombopag is \n\ndiscontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according to current treatment guidelines. Additional medical \n\nmanagement may include cessation of anticoagulant and/or anti-platelet therapy, reversal of \n\nanticoagulation, or platelet support. Platelet counts must be monitored weekly for 4 weeks following \n\ndiscontinuation of eltrombopag. \n\n \n\nIn HCV clinical studies, a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, including serious and fatal \n\ncases, was reported following discontinuation of peginterferon, ribavirin, and eltrombopag. Following \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy, patients should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal \n\nbleeding. \n\n \n\nBone marrow reticulin formation and risk of bone marrow fibrosis \n\n \n\nEltrombopag may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fibres within the bone \n\nmarrow. The relevance of this finding, as with other thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists, has \n\nnot been established yet. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiation of eltrombopag, the peripheral blood smear should be examined closely to establish \n\na baseline level of cellular morphologic abnormalities. Following identification of a stable dose of \n\neltrombopag, full blood count (FBC) with white blood cell count (WBC) differential should be \n\nperformed monthly. If immature or dysplastic cells are observed, peripheral blood smears should be \n\nexamined for new or worsening morphological abnormalities (e.g. teardrop and nucleated red blood \n\ncells, immature white blood cells) or cytopenia(s). If the patient develops new or worsening \n\nmorphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s), treatment with eltrombopag should be discontinued and \n\na bone marrow biopsy considered, including staining for fibrosis. \n\n \n\nProgression of existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) \n\n \n\nThere is a theoretical concern that TPO-R agonists may stimulate the progression of existing \n\nhaematological malignancies such as MDS. TPO-R agonists are growth factors that lead to \n\nthrombopoietic progenitor cell expansion, differentiation and platelet production. The TPO-R is \n\npredominantly expressed on the surface of cells of the myeloid lineage. For TPO-R agonists there is a \n\nconcern that they may stimulate the progression of existing haematopoietic malignancies such as \n\nMDS. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with a TPO-R agonist in patients with MDS, cases of transient increases in blast cell \n\ncounts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nThe diagnosis of ITP or SAA in adults and elderly patients should be confirmed by the exclusion of \n\nother clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be \n\nexcluded. Consideration should be given to performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy over the \n\ncourse of the disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, those with systemic \n\nsymptoms, or abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells. \n\n \n\nThe effectiveness and safety of Revolade have not been established for the treatment of \n\nthrombocytopenia due to MDS. Revolade should not be used outside of clinical studies for the \n\ntreatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nCytogenetic abnormalities and progression to MDS/AML in patients with SAA \n\n \n\nCytogenetic abnormalities are known to occur in SAA patients. It is not known whether eltrombopag \n\nincreases the risk of cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with SAA. In the phase II refractory SAA \n\nclinical study with eltrombopag with a starting dose of 50 mg/day (escalated every 2 weeks to a \n\nmaximum of 150 mg/day) (ELT112523), the incidence of new cytogenetic abnormalities was \n\nobserved in 17.1% of adult patients [7/41 (where 4 of them had changes in chromosome 7)]. The \n\nmedian time on study to a cytogenetic abnormality was 2.9 months. \n \n\nIn the phase II refractory SAA clinical study with eltrombopag at a dose of 150 mg/day (with ethnic or \n\nage related modifications as indicated) (ELT116826), the incidence of new cytogenetic abnormalities \n\nwas observed in 22.6% of adult patients [7/31 (where 3 of them had changes in chromosome 7)]. All \n\n7 patients had normal cytogenetics at baseline. Six patients had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 3 of \n\neltrombopag therapy and one patient had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 6. \n \n\nIn clinical studies with eltrombopag in SAA, 4% of patients (5/133) were diagnosed with MDS. The \n\nmedian time to diagnosis was 3 months from the start of eltrombopag treatment. \n\n \n\nFor SAA patients refractory to or heavily pretreated with prior immunosuppressive therapy, bone \n\nmarrow examination with aspirations for cytogenetics is recommended prior to initiation of \n\neltrombopag, at 3 months of treatment and 6 months thereafter. If new cytogenetic abnormalities are \n\ndetected, it must be evaluated whether continuation of eltrombopag is appropriate. \n\n \n\nOcular changes \n\n \n\nCataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents (see section 5.3). In \n\ncontrolled studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV receiving interferon therapy (n=1,439), \n\nprogression of pre-existing baseline cataract(s) or incident cataracts was reported in 8% of the \n\neltrombopag group and 5% of the placebo group. Retinal haemorrhages, mostly Grade 1 or 2, have \n\nbeen reported in HCV patients receiving interferon, ribavirin and eltrombopag (2% of the eltrombopag \n\ngroup and 2% of the placebo group. Haemorrhages occurred on the surface of the retina (preretinal), \n\nunder the retina (subretinal), or within the retinal tissue. Routine ophthalmologic monitoring of \n\npatients is recommended. \n\n \n\nQT/QTc prolongation \n\n \n\nA QTc study in healthy volunteers dosed 150 mg eltrombopag per day did not show a clinically \n\nsignificant effect on cardiac repolarisation. QTc interval prolongation has been reported in clinical \n\nstudies of patients with ITP and thrombocytopenic patients with HCV. The clinical significance of \n\nthese QTc prolongation events is unknown. \n\n \n\nLoss of response to eltrombopag \n\n \n\nA loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with eltrombopag treatment within the \n\nrecommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including an increased bone \n\nmarrow reticulin. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe above warnings and precautions for ITP also apply to the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nInterference with laboratory tests \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is highly coloured and so has the potential to interfere with some laboratory tests. Serum \n\ndiscolouration and interference with total bilirubin and creatinine testing have been reported in \n\npatients taking Revolade. If the laboratory results and clinical observations are inconsistent, re-testing \n\nusing another method may help in determining the validity of the result. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEffects of eltrombopag on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nHMG CoA reductase inhibitors \n\n \n\nAdministration of eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 5 days with a single 10 mg dose of the OATP1B1 \n\nand BCRP substrate rosuvastatin to 39 healthy adult subjects increased plasma rosuvastatin Cmax 103% \n\n(90% confidence interval [CI]: 82%, 126%) and AUC0-\uf0a5 55% (90% CI: 42%, 69%). Interactions are \n\nalso expected with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, \n\npravastatin and simvastatin. When co-administered with eltrombopag, a reduced dose of statins should \n\nbe considered and careful monitoring for statin adverse reactions should be undertaken (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nOATP1B1 and BCRP substrates \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of eltrombopag and OATP1B1 (e.g. methotrexate) and BCRP (e.g. \n\ntopotecan and methotrexate) substrates should be undertaken with caution (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 substrates \n\n \n\nIn studies utilising human liver microsomes, eltrombopag (up to 100 \uf06dM) showed no in vitro \n\ninhibition of the CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, and 4A9/11 and was an \n\ninhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 as measured using paclitaxel and diclofenac as the probe \n\nsubstrates. Administration of eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 7 days to 24 healthy male subjects did \n\nnot inhibit or induce the metabolism of probe substrates for 1A2 (caffeine), 2C19 (omeprazole), 2C9 \n\n(flurbiprofen), or 3A4 (midazolam) in humans. No clinically significant interactions are expected \n\nwhen eltrombopag and CYP450 substrates are co-administered (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHCV protease inhibitors \n\n \n\nDose adjustment is not required when eltrombopag is co-administered with either telaprevir or \n\nboceprevir. Co-administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg with telaprevir 750 mg every \n\n8 hours did not alter plasma telaprevir exposure. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg with boceprevir 800 mg every 8 hours did \n\nnot alter plasma boceprevir AUC(0-\uf074), but increased Cmax by 20%, and decreased Cmin by 32%. The \n\nclinical relevance of the decrease in Cmin has not been established, increased clinical and laboratory \n\nmonitoring for HCV suppression is recommended. \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on eltrombopag \n\n \n\nCiclosporin \n\n \nA decrease in eltrombopag exposure was observed with co-administration of 200 mg and 600 mg \n\nciclosporin (a BCRP inhibitor). The co-administration of 200 mg ciclosporin decreased the Cmax and \n\nthe AUCinf of eltrombopag by 25% and 18%, respectively. The co-administration of 600 mg \n\nciclosporin decreased the Cmax and the AUCinf of eltrombopag by 39% and 24%, respectively. \n\nEltrombopag dose adjustment is permitted during the course of the treatment based on the patient\u2019s \n\nplatelet count (see section 4.2). Platelet count should be monitored at least weekly for 2 to 3 weeks \n\nwhen eltrombopag is co-administered with ciclosporin. Eltrombopag dose may need to be increased \n\nbased on these platelet counts. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nPolyvalent cations (chelation) \n\n \n\nEltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium \n\nand zinc. Administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 75 mg with a polyvalent cation-containing \n\nantacid (1524 mg aluminium hydroxide and 1425 mg magnesium carbonate) decreased plasma \n\neltrombopag AUC0-\uf0a5 by 70% (90% CI: 64%, 76%) and Cmax by 70% (90% CI: 62%, 76%). \n\nEltrombopag should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as \n\nantacids, dairy products or mineral supplements containing polyvalent cations to avoid significant \n\nreduction in eltrombopag absorption due to chelation (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nLopinavir/ritonavir \n\n \n\nCo-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir may cause a decrease in the concentration \n\nof eltrombopag. A study in 40 healthy volunteers showed that the co-administration of a single 100 mg \n\ndose of eltrombopag with repeat dose lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily resulted in a \n\nreduction in eltrombopag plasma AUCinf by 17% (90% CI: 6.6%, 26.6%). Therefore, caution should \n\nbe used when co-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir takes place. Platelet count \n\nshould be closely monitored in order to ensure appropriate medical management of the dose of \n\neltrombopag when lopinavir/ritonavir therapy is initiated or discontinued. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 and CYP2C8 inhibitors and inducers \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is metabolised through multiple pathways including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and \n\nUGT1A3 (see section 5.2). Medicinal products that inhibit or induce a single enzyme are unlikely to \n\nsignificantly affect plasma eltrombopag concentrations, whereas medicinal products that inhibit or \n\ninduce multiple enzymes have the potential to increase (e.g. fluvoxamine) or decrease (e.g. rifampicin) \n\neltrombopag concentrations. \n\n \n\nHCV protease inhibitors \n\n \n\nResults of a drug-drug pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction study show that co-administration of repeat \n\ndoses of boceprevir 800 mg every 8 hours or telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours with a single dose of \n\neltrombopag 200 mg did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure to a clinically significant extent. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products for treatment of ITP \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with eltrombopag in clinical studies \n\nincluded corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and \n\nanti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining eltrombopag with other \n\nmedicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the \n\nrecommended range (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nFood interaction \n\n \n\nThe administration of eltrombopag tablet or powder for oral suspension formulations with a high-\n\ncalcium meal (e.g. a meal that included dairy products) significantly reduced plasma eltrombopag \n\nAUC0-\u221e and Cmax. In contrast, the administration of eltrombopag 2 hours before or 4 hours after a high-\n\ncalcium meal or with low-calcium food [<50 mg calcium] did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure \n\nto a clinically significant extent (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAdministration of a single 50 mg dose of eltrombopag in tablet form with a standard high-calorie, \n\nhigh-fat breakfast that included dairy products reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC0-\u221e by 59% and \n\nmean Cmax by 65%. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAdministration of a single 25 mg dose of eltrombopag as powder for oral suspension with a high-\n\ncalcium, moderate-fat and moderate-calorie meal reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC0-\u221e by 75% \n\nand mean Cmax by 79%. This decrease of exposure was attenuated when a single 25 mg dose of \n\neltrombopag powder for oral suspension was administered 2 hours before a high-calcium meal (mean \n\nAUC0-\u221e was decreased by 20% and mean Cmax by 14%). \n\n \n\nFood low in calcium (<50 mg calcium), including fruit, lean ham, beef and unfortified (no added \n\ncalcium, magnesium or iron) fruit juice, unfortified soya milk and unfortified grain, did not \n\nsignificantly impact plasma eltrombopag exposure, regardless of calorie and fat content (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of eltrombopag in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nRevolade is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nRevolade is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether eltrombopag/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have \n\nshown that eltrombopag is likely secreted into milk (see section 5.3); therefore a risk to the suckling \n\nchild cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \n\ncontinue/abstain from Revolade therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \n\nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nFertility was not affected in male or female rats at exposures that were comparable to those in humans. \n\nHowever a risk for humans cannot be ruled out (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEltrombopag has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of \n\nthe patient and the adverse reaction profile of eltrombopag, including dizziness and lack of alertness, \n\nshould be borne in mind when considering the patient\u2019s ability to perform tasks that require \n\njudgement, motor and cognitive skills. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nImmune thrombocytopenia in adult and paediatric patients \n\n \n\nThe safety of Revolade was assessed using the pooled double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \n\nTRA100773A and B, TRA102537 (RAISE) and TRA113765, in which 403 patients were exposed to \n\nRevolade and 179 to placebo, in addition to data from the completed open-label studies TRA108057, \n\nTRA105325 (EXTEND) and TRA112940. Patients received study medication for up to 8 years (in \n\nEXTEND). The most important serious adverse reactions were hepatotoxicity and \n\nthrombotic/thromboembolic events. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of \n\npatients included nausea, diarrhoea and increased alanine aminotransferase. \n\n \n\nThe safety of Revolade in paediatric patients (aged 1 to 17 years) with previously treated ITP has been \n\ndemonstrated in two studies. PETIT2 (TRA115450) was a 2-part, double-blind and open-label, \n\nrandomised, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomised 2:1 and received Revolade (n=63) or \n\nplacebo (n=29) for up to 13 weeks in the randomised period of the study. PETIT (TRA108062) was a \n\n3-part, staggered-cohort, open-label and double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. Patients \n\nwere randomised 2:1 and received Revolade (n=44) or placebo (n=21), for up to 7 weeks. The profile \n\nof adverse reactions was comparable to that seen in adults with some additional adverse reactions, \n\nmarked \u2666 in the table below. The most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and \n\nolder (\u22653% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, \n\npyrexia, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, toothache and rhinorrhoea. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia with HCV infection in adult patients \n\n \n\nENABLE 1 (TPL103922 n=716) and ENABLE 2 (TPL108390 n=805) were randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies to assess the efficacy and safety of Revolade in \n\nthrombocytopenic patients with HCV infection who were otherwise eligible to initiate antiviral \n\ntherapy. In the HCV studies the safety population consisted of all randomised patients who received \n\ndouble-blind study medicinal product during Part 2 of ENABLE 1 (Revolade treatment n=450, \n\nplacebo treatment n=232) and ENABLE 2 (Revolade treatment n=506, placebo treatment n=253). \n\nPatients are analysed according to the treatment received (total safety double-blind population, \n\nRevolade n=955 and placebo n=484). The most important serious adverse reactions identified were \n\nhepatotoxicity and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. The most common adverse reactions occurring \n\nin at least 10% of patients included headache, anaemia, decreased appetite, cough, nausea, diarrhoea, \n\nhyperbilirubinaemia, alopecia, pruritus, myalgia, pyrexia, fatigue, influenza-like illness, asthenia, \n\nchills and oedema. \n\n \n\nSevere aplastic anaemia in adult patients \n\n \n\nThe safety of eltrombopag in severe aplastic anaemia was assessed in a single-arm, open-label study \n\n(N=43) in which 11 patients (26%) were treated for >6 months and 7 patients (21%) were treated for \n\n>1 year. The most important serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia and sepsis/infection. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included headache, \n\ndizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, transaminases increased, \n\narthralgia, pain in extremity, fatigue and pyrexia. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n\nList of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions in the adult ITP studies (N=763), paediatric ITP studies (N=171), the HCV \n\nstudies (N=1,520), the SAA studies (N=43) and post-marketing reports are listed below by MedDRA \n\nsystem organ class and by frequency. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are \n\nranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. The corresponding frequency category for \n\neach adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (\u22651/10); \n\ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nITP study population \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse

\n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic events (TEEs) \n\n \n\nIn 3 controlled and 2 uncontrolled clinical studies among adult ITP patients receiving eltrombopag \n\n(n=446), 17 patients experienced a total of 19 TEEs, which included (in descending order of \n\noccurrence) deep vein thrombosis (n=6), pulmonary embolism (n=6), acute myocardial infarction \n\n(n=2), cerebral infarction (n=2), embolism (n=1) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn a placebo-controlled study (n=288, Safety population), following 2 weeks\u2019 treatment in preparation \n\nfor invasive procedures, 6 of 143 (4%) adult patients with chronic liver disease receiving eltrombopag \n\nexperienced 7 TEEs of the portal venous system and 2 of 145 (1%) patients in the placebo group \n\nexperienced 3 TEEs. Five of the 6 patients treated with eltrombopag experienced the TEE at a platelet \n\ncount >200,000/\u00b5l \n\n \n\nNo specific risk factors were identified in those patients who experienced a TEE with the exception of \n\nplatelet counts \u2265200,000/\u00b5l (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nIn controlled studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV (n=1,439), 38 out of 955 patients (4%) \n\ntreated with eltrombopag experienced a TEE and 6 out of 484 patients (1%) in the placebo group \n\nexperienced TEEs. Portal vein thrombosis was the most common TEE in both treatment groups (2% in \n\npatients treated with eltrombopag versus < 1% for placebo) (see section 4.4). Patients with low \n\nalbumin levels (\u2264 35 g/l) or MELD \u226510 had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs than those with higher \n\nalbumin levels; those aged \u226560 years had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs compared to younger patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic decompensation (use with interferon) \n\n \n\nChronic HCV patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving alfa \n\ninterferon therapy. In 2 controlled clinical studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV, hepatic \n\ndecompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial \n\nperitonitis) was reported more frequently in the eltrombopag arm (11%) than in the placebo arm (6%). \n\nIn patients with low albumin levels (\u226435 g/l) or MELD score \u226510 at baseline, there was a 3-fold \n\ngreater risk of hepatic decompensation and an increase in the risk of a fatal adverse event compared to \n\nthose with less advanced liver disease. Eltrombopag should only be administered to such patients after \n\ncareful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. Patients with these \n\ncharacteristics should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatotoxixity \n\n \n\nIn the controlled clinical studies in chronic ITP with eltrombopag, increases in serum ALT, AST and \n\nbilirubin were observed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThese findings were mostly mild (Grade 1-2), reversible and not accompanied by clinically significant \n\nsymptoms that would indicate an impaired liver function. Across the 3 placebo-controlled studies in \n\nadults with chronic ITP, 1 patient in the placebo group and 1 patient in the eltrombopag group \n\nexperienced a Grade 4 liver test abnormality. In two placebo-controlled studies in paediatric patients \n\n(aged 1 to 17 years) with chronic ITP, ALT \uf0b33 x ULN was reported in 4.7% and 0% of the \n\neltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn 2 controlled clinical studies in patients with HCV, ALT or AST \uf0b33 x ULN was reported in 34% and \n\n38% of the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. Most patients receiving eltrombopag in \n\ncombination with peginterferon / ribavirin therapy will experience indirect hyperbilirubinaemia. \n\nOverall, total bilirubin \u22651.5 x ULN was reported in 76% and 50% of the eltrombopag and placebo \n\ngroups, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn the single-arm phase II monotherapy refractory SAA study, concurrent ALT or AST >3 x ULN \n\nwith total (indirect) bilirubin >1.5 x ULN were reported in 5% of patients. Total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN \n\noccurred in 14% of patients. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia following discontinuation of treatment \n\n \n\nIn the 3 controlled clinical ITP studies, transient decreases in platelet counts to levels lower than \n\nbaseline were observed following discontinuation of treatment in 8% and 8% of the eltrombopag and \n\nplacebo groups, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIncreased bone marrow reticulin \n\n \n\nAcross the programme, no patients had evidence of clinically relevant bone marrow abnormalities or \n\nclinical findings that would indicate bone marrow dysfunction. In a small number of ITP patients, \n\neltrombopag treatment was discontinued due to bone marrow reticulin (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nCytogenetic abnormalities \n\n \n\nIn the phase II refractory SAA clinical study with eltrombopag with a starting dose of 50 mg/day \n\n(escalated every 2 weeks to a maximum of 150 mg/day) (ELT112523), the incidence of new \n\ncytogenetic abnormalities was observed in 17.1% of adult patients [7/41 (where 4 of them had changes \n\nin chromosome 7)]. The median time on study to a cytogenetic abnormality was 2.9 months. \n\n \n\nIn the phase II refractory SAA clinical study with eltrombopag at a dose of 150 mg/day (with ethnic or \n\nage related modifications as indicated) (ELT116826), the incidence of new cytogenetic abnormalities \n\nwas observed in 22.6% of adult patients [7/31 (where 3 of them had changes in chromosome 7)]. All \n\n7 patients had normal cytogenetics at baseline. Six patients had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 3 of \n\neltrombopag therapy and one patient had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 6. \n\n \n\nHaematologic malignancies \n\n \n\nIn the single-arm, open-label study in SAA, three (7%) patients were diagnosed with MDS following \n\ntreatment with eltrombopag, in the two ongoing studies (ELT116826 and ELT116643), 1/28 (4%) and \n\n1/62 (2%) patient has been diagnosed with MDS or AML in each study. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase excessively and result in \n\nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications. In case of an overdose, consideration should be given to \n\noral administration of a metal cation-containing preparation, such as calcium, aluminium, or \n\nmagnesium preparations to chelate eltrombopag and thus limit absorption. Platelet counts should be \n\nclosely monitored. Treatment with eltrombopag should be reinitiated in accordance with dosing and \n\nadministration recommendations (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn the clinical studies there was one report of overdose where the patient ingested 5000 mg of \n\neltrombopag. Reported adverse reactions included mild rash, transient bradycardia, ALT and AST \n\nelevation, and fatigue. Liver enzymes measured between Days 2 and 18 after ingestion peaked at a \n\n1.6-fold ULN in AST, a 3.9-fold ULN in ALT, and a 2.4-fold ULN in total bilirubin, The platelet \n\ncounts were 672,000/\u00b5l on Day 18 after ingestion and the maximum platelet count was 929,000/\u00b5l. All \n\nevents were resolved without sequelae following treatment. \n\n \n\nBecause eltrombopag is not significantly renally excreted and is highly bound to plasma proteins, \n\nhaemodialysis would not be expected to be an effective method to enhance the elimination of \n\neltrombopag. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics. ATC code: B02BX 05. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTPO is the main cytokine involved in regulation of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, and is \n\nthe endogenous ligand for the TPO-R. Eltrombopag interacts with the transmembrane domain of the \n\nhuman TPO-R and initiates signalling cascades similar but not identical to that of endogenous \n\nthrombopoietin (TPO), inducing proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitor cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nImmune (primary) thrombocytopenia (ITP) studies \n\n \n\nTwo phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies RAISE (TRA102537) and \n\nTRA100773B and two open-label studies REPEAT (TRA108057) and EXTEND (TRA105325) \n\nevaluated the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in adult patients with previously treated ITP. Overall, \n\neltrombopag was administered to 277 ITP patients for at least 6 months and 202 patients for at least \n\n1 year. \n\n \n\nDouble-blind placebo-controlled studies \n\nRAISE: 197 ITP patients were randomised 2:1, eltrombopag (n=135) to placebo (n=62), and \n\nrandomisation was stratified based upon splenectomy status, use of ITP medicinal products at baseline \n\nand baseline platelet count. The dose of eltrombopag was adjusted during the 6-month treatment \n\nperiod based on individual platelet counts. All patients initiated treatment with eltrombopag 50 mg. \n\nFrom Day 29 to the end of treatment, 15 to 28% of eltrombopag-treated patients were maintained on \n\n\u226425 mg and 29 to 53% received 75 mg. \n\n \n\nIn addition, patients could taper off concomitant ITP medicinal products and receive rescue treatments \n\nas dictated by local standard of care. More than half of all patients in each treatment group had \u22653 \n\nprior ITP therapies and 36% had a prior splenectomy. \n\n \n\nMedian platelet counts at baseline were 16,000/\uf06dl for both treatment groups and in the eltrombopag \n\ngroup were maintained above 50,000/\u00b5l at all on-therapy visits starting at Day 15; in contrast, median \n\nplatelet counts in the placebo group remained <30,000/\u00b5l throughout the study. \n\n \n\nPlatelet count response between 50,000-400,000/\uf06dl in the absence of rescue treatment was achieved by \n\nsignificantly more patients in the eltrombopag treated group during the 6 month treatment period, \n\np <0.001. Fifty-four percent of the eltrombopag-treated patients and 13% of placebo-treated patients \n\nachieved this level of response after 6 weeks of treatment. A similar platelet response was maintained \n\nthroughout the study, with 52% and 16% of patients responding at the end of the 6-month treatment \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 4 Secondary efficacy results from RAISE \n\n \n\n \n\nEltrombopag \n\nN=135 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=62 \n\nKey secondary endpoints \n\nNumber of cumulative weeks with platelet counts \n\n\uf0b350,000-400,000/\u00b5l, Mean (SD) \n11.3 (9.46) 2.4 (5.95) \n\nPatients with \u226575% of assessments in the target range (50,000 to \n\n400,000/\uf06dl), n (%) \n\np-value a \n\n51 (38) 4 (7) \n\n<0.001 \n\nPatients with bleeding (WHO Grades 1-4) at any time during \n\n6 months, n (%) \n\n p-value a \n\n106 (79) 56 (93) \n\n0.012 \n\nPatients with bleeding (WHO Grades 2-4) at any time during \n\n6 months, n (%) \n\n p-value a \n\n44 (33) 32 (53) \n\n0.002 \n\nRequiring rescue therapy, n (%) \n\n p-value a \n\n24 (18) 25 (40) \n\n0.001 \n\nPatients receiving ITP therapy at baseline (n) 63 31 \n\nPatients who attempted to reduce or discontinue baseline \n\ntherapy, n (%)b \n\n p-value a \n\n37 (59) 10 (32) \n\n0.016 \n\na Logistic regression model adjusted for randomisation stratification variables \n\nb 21 out of 63 (33%) patients treated with eltrombopag who were taking an ITP medicinal product \n\nat baseline permanently discontinued all baseline ITP medicinal products. \n\n \n\nAt baseline, more than 70% of ITP patients in each treatment group reported any bleeding (WHO \n\nGrades 1-4) and more than 20% reported clinically significant bleeding (WHO Grades 2-4), \n\nrespectively.

In \n\naddition, in the RAISE study, 42% of patients with baseline platelet count \u226415,000/\u03bcl treated with \n\neltrombopag responded at the end of the 6 month treatment period. Forty-two to 60% of the \n\neltrombopag-treated patients in the RAISE study were receiving 75 mg from Day 29 to the end of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nAn open-label, repeat-dose study (3 cycles of 6 weeks of treatment, followed by 4 weeks off \n\ntreatment) showed that episodic use with multiple courses of eltrombopag has demonstrated no loss of \n\nresponse. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag was administered to 302 ITP patients in the open-label extension study EXTEND \n\n(TRA105325), 218 patients completed 1 year, 180 completed 2 years, 107 completed 3 years, 75 \n\ncompleted 4 years, 34 completed 5 years and 18 completed 6 years. The median baseline platelet count \n\nwas 19,000/\uf06dl prior to eltrombopag administration. Median platelet counts at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and \n\n7 years on study were 85,000/\uf06dl, 85,000/\uf06dl, 105,000/\uf06dl, 64,000/\uf06dl, 75,000/\uf06dl, 119,000/\uf06dl and \n\n76,000/\uf06dl, respectively. \n\n \n\nClinical studies comparing eltrombopag to other treatment options (e.g. splenectomy) have not been \n\nconducted. The long-term safety of eltrombopag should be considered prior to starting therapy. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (aged 1 to 17 years) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in paediatric patients have been investigated in two studies. \n\n \n\nTRA115450 (PETIT2): The primary endpoint was a sustained response, defined as the proportion of \n\npatients receiving eltrombopag, compared to placebo, achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u00b5l for at least \n\n6 out of 8 weeks (in the absence of rescue therapy), between weeks 5 to 12 during the double-blind \n\nrandomised period. Patients were diagnosed with chronic ITP for at least 1 year and were refractory or \n\nrelapsed to at least one prior ITP therapy or unable to continue other ITP treatments for a medical \n\nreason and had platelet count <30,000/\u00b5l. Ninety-two patients were randomised by three age cohort \n\nstrata (2:1) to eltrombopag (n=63) or placebo (n=29). The dose of eltrombopag could be adjusted \n\nbased on individual platelet counts. \n\n \n\nOverall, a significantly greater proportion of eltrombopag patients (40%) compared with placebo \n\npatients (3%) achieved the primary endpoint (Odds Ratio: 18.0 [95% CI: 2.3, 140.9] p <0.001) which \n\nwas similar across the three age cohorts (Table 6). \n\n \n\nTable 6 Sustained platelet response rates by age cohort in paediatric patients with chronic \n\nITP \n\n \n\n Eltrombopag \n\nn/N (%) \n\n[95% CI] \n\nPlacebo \n\nn/N (%) \n\n[95% CI] \n\nCohort 1 (12 to 17 years) \n\n \n\nCohort 2 (6 to 11 years) \n\n \n\nCohort 3 (1 to 5 years) \n\n9/23 (39%) \n\n[20%, 61%] \n\n11/26 (42%) \n\n[23%, 63%] \n\n5/14 (36%) \n\n[13%, 65%] \n\n1/10 (10%) \n\n[0%, 45%] \n\n0/13 (0%) \n\n[N/A] \n\n0/6 (0%) \n\n[N/A] \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nStatistically fewer eltrombopag patients required rescue treatment during the randomised period \n\ncompared to placebo patients (19% [12/63] vs. 24% [7/29], p=0.032). \n\n \n\nAt baseline, 71% of patients in the eltrombopag group and 69% in the placebo group reported any \n\nbleeding (WHO Grades 1-4). At Week 12, the proportion of eltrombopag patients reporting any \n\nbleeding was decreased to half of baseline (36%). In comparison, at Week 12, 55% of placebo patients \n\nreported any bleeding. \n\n \n\nPatients were permitted to reduce or discontinue baseline ITP therapy only during the open-label phase \n\nof the study and 53% (8/15) of patients were able to reduce (n=1) or discontinue (n=7) baseline ITP \n\ntherapy, mainly corticosteroids, without needing rescue therapy. \n\n \n\nTRA108062 (PETIT): The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving platelet counts \n\n\u226550,000/\u00b5l at least once between weeks 1 and 6 of the randomised period. Patients were diagnosed \n\nwith ITP for at least 6 months and were refractory or relapsed to at least one prior ITP therapy with a \n\nplatelet count <30,000/\u00b5l (n=67). During the randomised period of the study, patients were \n\nrandomised by three age cohort strata (2:1) to eltrombopag (n=45) or placebo (n=22). The dose of \n\neltrombopag could be adjusted based on individual platelet counts. \n\n \n\nOverall, a significantly greater proportion of eltrombopag patients (62%) compared with placebo \n\npatients (32%) met the primary endpoint (Odds Ratio: 4.3 [95% CI: 1.4, 13.3] p=0.011). \n\n \n\nSustained response was seen in 50% of the initial responders during 20 out of 24 weeks in the \n\nPETIT 2 study and 15 out of 24 weeks in the PETIT study. \n\n \n\nChronic hepatitis C associated thrombocytopenia studies \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with HCV \n\ninfection were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. ENABLE 1 \n\nutilised peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for antiviral treatment and ENABLE 2 utilised \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. Patients did not receive direct acting antiviral agents. In both \n\nstudies, patients with a platelet count of <75,000/\u00b5l were enrolled and stratified by platelet count \n\n(<50,000/\u00b5l and \u226550,000/\u00b5l to <75,000/\u00b5l), screening HCV RNA (<800,000 IU/ml and \n\n\u2265800,000 IU/ml), and HCV genotype (genotype 2/3, and genotype 1/4/6). \n\n \n\nBaseline disease characteristics were similar in both studies and were consistent with compensated \n\ncirrhotic HCV patient population. The majority of patients were HCV genotype 1 (64%) and had \n\nbridging fibrosis/cirrhosis. Thirty-one percent of patients had been treated with prior HCV therapies, \n\nprimarily pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. The median baseline platelet count was 59,500/\u00b5l in both \n\ntreatment groups: 0.8%, 28% and 72% of the patients recruited had platelet counts <20,000/\u00b5l, \n\n<50.000/\u00b5l and \u226550,000/\u00b5l respectively. \n\n \n\nThe studies consisted of two phases \u2013 a pre-antiviral treatment phase and an antiviral treatment phase. \n\nIn the pre-antiviral treatment phase, patients received open-label eltrombopag to increase the platelet \n\ncount to \u226590,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 1 and \u2265100,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 2. The median time to achieve the \n\ntarget platelet count \u226590,000/\u00b5l (ENABLE 1) or \u2265100,000/\u00b5l (ENABLE 2) was 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as the \n\npercentage of patients with no detectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after completion of the planned \n\ntreatment period. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIn both HCV studies, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with eltrombopag (n=201, \n\n21%) achieved SVR compared to those treated with placebo (n=65, 13%) (see Table 7). The \n\nimprovement in the proportion of patients who achieved SVR was consistent across all subgroups in \n\nthe randomisation strata (baseline platelet counts (<50,000 vs. >50,000), viral load (<800,000 IU/ml \n\nvs. \u2265800,000 IU/ml) and genotype (2/3 vs. 1/4/6)). \n\n \n\nTable 7 Virologic response in HCV patients in ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2 \n\n \n\n Pooled data ENABLE 1a ENABLE 2b \n\nPatients achieving \n\ntarget platelet counts \n\nand initiating antiviral \n\ntherapy c \n\n \n\n1,439/1,520 (95%) \n\n \n\n680/715 (95%) \n\n \n\n759/805 (94%) \n\n Eltrombopag Placebo Eltrombopag Placebo Eltrombopag Placebo \n\nTotal number of \n\npatients entering \n\nantiviral treatment \n\nphase \n\nn=956 n=485 n=450 n=232 n=506 n=253 \n\n % patients achieving virologic response \n\nOverall SVR d  21 13 23 14 19 13 \n\nHCV RNA Genotype       \n\nGenotype 2/3 35 25 35 24 34 25 \n\nGenotype 1/4/6e 15 8 18 10 13 7 \n\nAlbumin levels f    \n\n\u2264 35g/l 11 8 \n\n> 35g/l 25 16 \n\nMELD scoref   \n\n\u2265 10  18 10 \n\n< 10 23 17 \n\na Eltrombopag given in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (180 \u03bcg once weekly for \n\n48 weeks for genotypes 1/4/6; 24 weeks for genotype 2/3) plus ribavirin (800 to 1200 mg daily \n\nin 2 divided doses orally) \n\nb Eltrombopag given in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u03bcg/kg once weekly for \n\n48 weeks for genotype 1/4/6; 24 weeks for genotype 2/3) plus ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg orally \n\nin 2 divided doses) \n\nc Target platelet count was \uf0b390,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 1 and \uf0b3100,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 2. For \n\nENABLE 1, 682 patients were randomised to the antiviral treatment phase; however 2 patients \n\nthen withdrew consent prior to receiving antiviral therapy \n\nd p-value <0.05 for eltrombopag versus placebo \n\ne 64% patients participating in ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2 were genotype 1 \n\nf Post-hoc analyses \n\n \n\nOther secondary findings of the studies included the following: significantly fewer patients treated \n\nwith eltrombopag prematurely discontinued antiviral therapy compared to placebo (45% vs. 60%, \n\np=<0.0001). A greater proportion of patients on eltrombopag did not require any antiviral dose \n\nreduction as compared to placebo (45% vs. 27%). Eltrombopag treatment delayed and reduced the \n\nnumber of peginterferon dose reductions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n27 \n\nSevere aplastic anaemia \n\n \n\nEltrombopag was studied in a single-arm, single-centre open-label study in 43 patients with severe \n\naplastic anaemia with refractory thrombocytopenia following at least one prior immunosuppressive \n\ntherapy (IST) and who had a platelet count \u226430,000/\u00b5l. \n\n \n\nThe majority of patients, 33 (77%), were considered to have \u2018primary refractory disease\u2019, defined as \n\nhaving no prior adequate response to IST in any lineage. The remaining 10 patients had insufficient \n\nplatelet response to prior therapies. All 10 had received at least 2 prior IST regimens and 50% had \n\nreceived at least 3 prior IST regimens. Patients with diagnosis of Fanconi anaemia, infection not \n\nresponding to appropriate therapy, PNH clone size in neutrophils of \u226550%, where excluded from \n\nparticipation. \n\n \n\nAt baseline the median platelet count was 20,000/\u00b5l, haemoglobin was 8.4 g/dl, ANC was 0.58 x 109/l \n\nand absolute reticulocyte count was 24.3 x 109/l. Eighty-six percent of patients were RBC transfusion \n\ndependent, and 91% were platelet transfusion dependent. The majority of patients (84%) had received \n\nat least 2 prior immunosuppressive therapies. Three patients had cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was haematological response assessed after 12 weeks of eltrombopag treatment. \n\nHaematological response was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria: 1) platelet \n\ncount increases to 20,000/\u00b5l above baseline or stable platelet counts with transfusion independence for \n\na minimum of 8 weeks; 2) haemoglobin increase by >1.5g/dl, or a reduction in \u22654 units of red blood \n\ncell (RBC) transfusions for 8 consecutive weeks; 3) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) increase of \n\n100% or an ANC increase >0.5 x 109/l. \n\n \n\nThe haematological response rate was 40% (17/43 patients; 95% CI 25, 56), the majority were \n\nunilineage responses (13/17, 76%) whilst there were 3 bilineage and 1 trilineage responses at week 12. \n\nEltrombopag was discontinued after 16 weeks if no haematological response or transfusion \n\nindependence was observed. Patients who responded continued therapy in an extension phase of the \n\nstudy. A total of 14 patients entered the extension phase of the trial. Nine of these patients achieved a \n\nmulti-lineage response, 4 of the 9 remain on treatment and 5 tapered off treatment with eltrombopag \n\nand maintained the response (median follow up: 20.6 months, range: 5.7 to 22.5 months). The \n\nremaining 5 patients discontinued treatment, three due to relapse at the month 3 extension visit. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with eltrombopag 59% (23/39) became platelet transfusion independent (28 days \n\nwithout platelet transfusion) and 27% (10/37) became RBC transfusion independent (56 days without \n\nRBC transfusion). The longest platelet transfusion-free period for non-responders was 27 days \n\n(median). The longest platelet transfusion-free period for responders was 287 days (median). The \n\nlongest RBC transfusion-free period for non-responders was 29 days (median). The longest RBC \n\ntransfusion-free period for responders was 266 days (median). \n\n \n\nOver 50% of responders who were transfusion-dependent at baseline, had >80% reduction in both \n\nplatelet and RBC transfusion requirements compared to baseline. \n\n \n\nPreliminary results from a supportive study (Study ELT116826), an ongoing non-randomised, \n\nphase II, single-arm, open-label study in refractory SAA patients, showed consistent results. Data are \n\nlimited to 21 out of the planned 60 patients with haematological responses reported by 52% of patients \n\nat 6 months. Multilineage responses were reported by 45% of patients. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nPharmacokinetics \n\n \n\nThe plasma eltrombopag concentration-time data collected in 88 patients with ITP in studies \n\nTRA100773A and TRA100773B were combined with data from 111 healthy adult subjects in a \n\npopulation PK analysis.

In a relative bioavailability study in adults, the eltrombopag powder for oral \n\nsuspension delivered 22% higher plasma AUC(0-\uf0a5) than the film-coated tablet formulation. The \n\nabsolute oral bioavailability of eltrombopag after administration to humans has not been established. \n\nBased on urinary excretion and metabolites eliminated in faeces, the oral absorption of drug-related \n\nmaterial following administration of a single 75 mg eltrombopag solution dose was estimated to be at \n\nleast 52%. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99.9%), predominantly to albumin. \n\nEltrombopag is a substrate for BCRP, but is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein or OATP1B1. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is primarily metabolised through cleavage, oxidation and conjugation with glucuronic \n\nacid, glutathione, or cysteine. In a human radiolabel study, eltrombopag accounted for approximately \n\n64% of plasma radiocarbon AUC0-\uf0a5. Minor metabolites due to glucuronidation and oxidation were \n\nalso detected. In vitro studies suggest that CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 are responsible for oxidative \n\nmetabolism of eltrombopag. Uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 are \n\nresponsible for glucuronidation, and bacteria in the lower gastrointestinal tract may be responsible for \n\nthe cleavage pathway. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAbsorbed eltrombopag is extensively metabolised. The predominant route of eltrombopag excretion is \n\nvia faeces (59%) with 31% of the dose found in the urine as metabolites. Unchanged parent compound \n\n(eltrombopag) is not detected in urine. Unchanged eltrombopag excreted in faeces accounts for \n\napproximately 20% of the dose. The plasma elimination half-life of eltrombopag is approximately \n\n21-32 hours. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nBased on a human study with radiolabelled eltrombopag, glucuronidation plays a minor role in the \n\nmetabolism of eltrombopag. Human liver microsome studies identified UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 as the \n\nenzymes responsible for eltrombopag glucuronidation. Eltrombopag was an inhibitor of a number of \n\nUGT enzymes in vitro. Clinically significant drug interactions involving glucuronidation are not \n\nanticipated due to limited contribution of individual UGT enzymes in the glucuronidation of \n\neltrombopag. \n\n \n\nApproximately 21% of an eltrombopag dose could undergo oxidative metabolism. Human liver \n\nmicrosome studies identified CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 as the enzymes responsible for eltrombopag \n\noxidation. Eltrombopag does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes based on in vitro and in vivo data \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrate that eltrombopag is an inhibitor of the OATP1B1 transporter and an \n\ninhibitor of the BCRP transporter and eltrombopag increased exposure of the OATP1B1 and BCRP \n\nsubstrate rosuvastatin in a clinical drug interaction study (see section 4.5). In clinical studies with \n\neltrombopag, a dose reduction of statins by 50% was recommended. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium \n\nand zinc (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that eltrombopag is not a substrate for the organic anion transporter \n\npolypeptide, OATP1B1, but is an inhibitor of this transporter (IC50 value of 2.7 \u03bcM (1.2 \u03bcg/ml). In \n\nvitro studies also demonstrated that eltrombopag is a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate \n\nand inhibitor (IC50 value of 2.7 \u03bcM (1.2 \u03bcg/ml). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n\nSpecial patient populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been studied after administration of eltrombopag to adult \n\npatients with renal impairment. Following administration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0-\uf0a5 of \n\neltrombopag was 32% to 36% lower in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, and 60% \n\nlower in patients with severe renal impairment compared with healthy volunteers. There was \n\nsubstantial variability and significant overlap in exposures between patients with renal impairment and \n\nhealthy volunteers. Unbound eltrombopag (active) concentrations for this highly protein-bound \n\nmedicinal product were not measured. Patients with impaired renal function should use eltrombopag \n\nwith caution and close monitoring, for example by testing serum creatinine and/or urine analysis (see \n\nsection 4.2). The efficacy and safety of eltrombopag have not been established in patients with both \n\nmoderate to severe renal impairment and hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been studied after administration of eltrombopag to adult \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. Following the administration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0-\uf0a5 of \n\neltrombopag was 41% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 80% to 93% higher in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy volunteers. There was \n\nsubstantial variability and significant overlap in exposures between patients with hepatic impairment \n\nand healthy volunteers. Unbound eltrombopag (active) concentrations for this highly protein-bound \n\nmedicinal product were not measured. \n\n \n\nThe influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag following repeat \n\nadministration was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 28 healthy adults and \n\n714 patients with hepatic impairment (673 patients with HCV and 41 patients with chronic liver \n\ndisease of other aetiology). Of the 714 patients, 642 were with mild hepatic impairment, 67 with \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 2 with severe hepatic impairment. Compared to healthy volunteers, \n\npatients with mild hepatic impairment had approximately 111% (95% CI: 45% to 283%) higher \n\nplasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values and patients with moderate hepatic impairment had \n\napproximately 183% (95% CI: 90% to 459%) higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values. \n\n \n\nTherefore, eltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \n\n\u22655) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). For patients with HCV initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nRace \n\n \n\nThe influence of Asian ethnicity (such as Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) on the \n\npharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 \n\nhealthy adults (31 Asians) and 88 patients with ITP (18 Asians). Based on estimates from the \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, Asian ITP patients had approximately 49% higher plasma \n\neltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values as compared to non-Asian patients who were predominantly Caucasian \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe influence of Asian ethnicity (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Thai) on the \n\npharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \n\n635 patients with HCV (145 Asians and 69 South Asians). Based on estimates from the population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis, Asian patients had approximately 55% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) \n\nvalues as compared to patients of other races who were predominantly Caucasian (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n31 \n\nGender \n\n \n\nThe influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (14 females) and 88 patients with ITP (57 females). \n\nBased on estimates from the population pharmacokinetic analysis, female ITP patients had \n\napproximately 23% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) as compared to male patients, without \n\nadjustment for body weight differences. \n\n \n\nThe influence of gender on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population \n\npharmacokinetics analysis in 635 patients with HCV (260 females). Based on model estimate, female \n\nHCV patient had approximately 41% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) as compared to male \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nAge \n\n \n\nThe influence of age on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population \n\npharmacokinetics analysis in 28 healthy subjects, 673 patients with HCV, and 41 patients with chronic \n\nliver disease of other aetiology ranging from 19 to 74 years old. There are no PK data on the use of \n\neltrombopag in patients \u226575 years. Based on model estimate, elderly (\u226565 years) patients had \n\napproximately 41% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) as compared to younger patients (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (aged 1 to 17 years) \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been evaluated in 168 paediatric ITP patients dosed once \n\ndaily in two studies, TRA108062/PETIT and TRA115450/PETIT-2. Plasma eltrombopag apparent \n\nclearance following oral administration (CL/F) increased with increasing body weight. The effects of \n\nrace and sex on plasma eltrombopag CL/F estimates were consistent between paediatric and adult \n\npatients. Asian paediatric ITP patients had approximately 43% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) \n\nvalues as compared to non-Asian patients. Female paediatric ITP patients had approximately 25% \n\nhigher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values as compared to male patients. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of eltrombopag in paediatric patients with ITP are shown in \n\nTable 10. \n\n \n\nTable 10 Geometric mean (95% CI) steady-state plasma eltrombopag pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in paediatric patients with ITP (50 mg once daily dosing regimen) \n\n \n\nAge Cmax \n(\u00b5g/ml) \n\nAUC(0-\uf074) \n(\u00b5g.hr/ml) \n\n12 to 17 years (n=62) 6.80 \n\n(6.17, 7.50) \n\n103 \n\n(91.1, 116) \n\n6 to 11 years (n=68) 10.3 \n\n(9.42, 11.2) \n\n153 \n\n(137, 170) \n\n1 to 5 years (n=38) 11.6 \n\n(10.4, 12.9) \n\n162 \n\n(139, 187) \n\nData presented as geometric mean (95%CI).

Therefore, data from these animals do not fully model potential adverse effects \n\nrelated to the pharmacology of eltrombopag in humans, including the reproduction and carcinogenicity \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nTreatment-related cataracts were detected in rodents and were dose and time-dependent. At \u22656 times \n\nthe human clinical exposure in adult ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in adult HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC, cataracts were observed in mice after \n\n6 weeks and rats after 28 weeks of dosing. At \uf0b34 times the human clinical exposure in ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and 2 times the human exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC, cataracts \n\nwere observed in mice after 13 weeks and in rats after 39 weeks of dosing. At non-tolerated doses in \n\npre-weaning juvenile rats dosed from Days 4-32 (approximately equating to a 2-year-old human at the \n\nend of the dosing period), ocular opacities were observed (histology not performed) at 9 times the \n\nmaximum human clinical exposure in paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day, based on AUC. However, \n\ncataracts were not observed in juvenile rats given tolerated doses at 5 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in paediatric ITP patients, based on AUC. Cataracts have not been observed in adult dogs \n\nafter 52 weeks of dosing at 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and equivalent to the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on \n\nAUC). \n\n \n\nRenal tubular toxicity was observed in studies of up to 14 days duration in mice and rats at exposures \n\nthat were generally associated with morbidity and mortality. Tubular toxicity was also observed in a \n\n2-year oral carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day. Effects were less \n\nsevere at lower doses and were characterised by a spectrum of regenerative changes. The exposure at \n\nthe lowest dose was 1.2 or 0.8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in adult or paediatric \n\nITP patients at 75 mg/day and 0.6 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, \n\nbased on AUC. Renal effects were not observed in rats after 28 weeks or in dogs after 52 weeks at \n\nexposures 4 and 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult ITP patients and 3 and 2 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 2 times and equivalent to the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nHepatocyte degeneration and/or necrosis, often accompanied by increased serum liver enzymes, was \n\nobserved in mice, rats and dogs at doses that were associated with morbidity and mortality or were \n\npoorly tolerated. No hepatic effects were observed after chronic dosing in rats (28 weeks) and in dogs \n\n(52 weeks) at 4 or 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult ITP patients and 3 or 2 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 2 times or equivalent to the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nAt poorly tolerated doses in rats and dogs (>10 or 7 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and>4 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC), decreased reticulocyte counts and regenerative bone marrow erythroid \n\nhyperplasia (rats only) were observed in short-term studies. There were no effects of note on red cell \n\nmass or reticulocyte counts after dosing for up to 28 weeks in rats, 52 weeks in dogs and 2 years in \n\nmice or rats at maximally tolerated doses which were 2 to 4 times human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and \u22642 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nEndosteal hyperostosis was observed in a 28-week toxicity study in rats at a non-tolerated dose of \n\n60 mg/kg/day (6 times or 4 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC). \n\nThere were no bone changes observed in mice or rats after lifetime exposure (2 years) at 4 times or \n\n2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 2 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag was not carcinogenic in mice at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to \n\n40 mg/kg/day (exposures up to 4 or 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP \n\npatients at 75 mg/day and 2 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based \n\non AUC). Eltrombopag was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a bacterial mutation assay or in two in \n\nvivo assays in rats (micronucleus and unscheduled DNA synthesis, 10 times or 8 times the human \n\nclinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 7 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on Cmax). In the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, \n\neltrombopag was marginally positive (<3-fold increase in mutation frequency). These in vitro and in \n\nvivo findings suggest that eltrombopag does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag did not affect female fertility, early embryonic development or embryofoetal \n\ndevelopment in rats at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\nadolescent (12-17 years old) ITP patients at 75 mg/day and equivalent to the human clinical exposure \n\nin HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC). Also there was no effect on embryofoetal \n\ndevelopment in rabbits at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested (0.3 to 0.5 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in ITP patients at 75 mg/day and HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on \n\nAUC). However, at a maternally toxic dose of 60 mg/kg/day (6 times the human clinical exposure in \n\nITP patients at 75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, \n\nbased on AUC) in rats, eltrombopag treatment was associated with embryo lethality (increased pre- \n\nand post-implantation loss), reduced foetal body weight and gravid uterine weight in the female \n\nfertility study and a low incidence of cervical ribs and reduced foetal body weight in the embryofoetal \n\ndevelopment study. Eltrombopag should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit \n\njustifies the potential risk to the foetus (see section 4.6). Eltrombopag did not affect male fertility in \n\nrats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested (3 times the human clinical exposure in ITP \n\npatients at 75 mg/day and 2 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based \n\non AUC). In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, there were no undesirable effects on \n\npregnancy, parturition or lactation of F0 female rats at maternally non-toxic doses (10 and \n\n20 mg/kg/day) and no effects on the growth, development, neurobehavioural or reproductive function \n\nof the offspring (F1). Eltrombopag was detected in the plasma of all F1 rat pups for the entire 22 hour \n\nsampling period following administration of medicinal product to the F0 dams, suggesting that rat pup \n\nexposure to eltrombopag was likely via lactation. \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies with eltrombopag suggest a potential phototoxicity risk; however, in rodents there was \n\nno evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity (10 or 7 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 5 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC) or ocular phototoxicity (\uf0b34 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC). Furthermore, a clinical pharmacology study in 36 subjects showed no \n\nevidence that photosensitivity was increased following administration of eltrombopag 75 mg. This was \n\nmeasured by delayed phototoxic index. Nevertheless, a potential risk of photoallergy cannot be ruled \n\nout since no specific preclinical study could be performed. \n\n \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n\n \n\nAt non-tolerated doses in pre-weaning rats, ocular opacities were observed. At tolerated doses, no \n\nocular opacities were observed (see above subsection \u2018Safety pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicity\u2019). \n\nIn conclusion, taking into account the exposure margins based on AUC, a risk of eltrombopag-related \n\ncataracts in paediatric patients cannot be excluded. There are no findings in juvenile rats to suggest a \n\ngreater risk of toxicity with eltrombopag treatment in paediatric vs. adult ITP patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nRevolade 25 mg powder for oral suspension \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach sachet contains eltrombopag olamine equivalent to 25 mg of eltrombopag. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for oral suspension \n\n \n\nReddish-brown to yellow powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nRevolade is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 1 year and above with primary immune \n\nthrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who are refractory to other \n\ntreatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nRevolade is indicated in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the treatment \n\nof thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor preventing the \n\ninitiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nRevolade is indicated in adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either \n\nrefractory to prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nEltrombopag treatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician who is \n\nexperienced in the treatment of haematological diseases or the management of chronic hepatitis C and \n\nits complications. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nEltrombopag dosing requirements must be individualised based on the patient\u2019s platelet counts. The \n\nobjective of treatment with eltrombopag should not be to normalise platelet counts. \n\n \n\nThe powder for oral suspension may lead to higher eltrombopag exposure than the tablet formulation \n\n(see section 5.2). When switching between the tablet and powder for oral suspension formulations, \n\nplatelet counts should be monitored weekly for 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nImmune (primary) thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nThe lowest dose of eltrombopag to achieve and maintain a platelet count \u226550,000/\u00b5l should be used. \n\nDose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response. Eltrombopag must not be used to \n\nnormalise platelet counts. In clinical studies, platelet counts generally increased within 1 to 2 weeks \n\nafter starting eltrombopag and decreased within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nAdults and paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years \n\nThe recommended starting dose of eltrombopag is 50 mg once daily. For patients of Asian ancestry \n\n(such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean or Thai), eltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced \n\ndose of 25 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population aged 1 to 5 years \n\nThe recommended starting dose of eltrombopag is 25 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nMonitoring and dose adjustment \n\nAfter initiating eltrombopag, the dose must be adjusted to achieve and maintain a platelet count \n\n\u226550,000/\u00b5l as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding. A daily dose of 75 mg must not be exceeded. \n\n \n\nClinical haematology and liver tests should be monitored regularly throughout therapy with \n\neltrombopag and the dose regimen of eltrombopag modified based on platelet counts as outlined in \n\nTable 1. During therapy with eltrombopag full blood counts (FBCs), including platelet count and \n\nperipheral blood smears, should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count (\u226550,000/\u00b5l for at \n\nleast 4 weeks) has been achieved. FBCs including platelet counts and peripheral blood smears should \n\nbe obtained monthly thereafter. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in ITP patients \n\n \n\nPlatelet count Dose adjustment or response \n\n<50,000/\u00b5l following at least \n\n2 weeks of therapy \n\nIncrease daily dose by 25 mg to a maximum of 75 mg/day*. \n\n\uf0b350,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3150,000/\u00b5l Use lowest dose of eltrombopag and/or concomitant ITP \n\ntreatment to maintain platelet counts that avoid or reduce \n\nbleeding. \n\n>150,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3250,000/\u00b5l Decrease the daily dose by 25 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the \n\neffects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments\u2666. \n\n>250,000/\u00b5l Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring \n\nto twice weekly. \n\n \n\nOnce the platelet count is \u2264100,000/\u00b5l, reinitiate therapy at a \n\ndaily dose reduced by 25 mg. \n\n* For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once every other day, increase dose to 25 mg once daily. \n\n\u2666 For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once daily, consideration should be given to dosing at \n\n12.5 mg once daily or alternatively a dose of 25 mg once every other day. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag can be administered in addition to other ITP medicinal products. The dose regimen of \n\nconcomitant ITP medicinal products should be modified, as medically appropriate, to avoid excessive \n\nincreases in platelet counts during therapy with eltrombopag. \n\n \n\nIt is necessary to wait for at least 2 weeks to see the effect of any dose adjustment on the patient\u2019s \n\nplatelet response prior to considering another dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nThe standard eltrombopag dose adjustment, either decrease or increase, would be 25 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nTreatment with eltrombopag should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level \n\nsufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 75 mg once \n\ndaily. \n\n \n\nPatients should be clinically evaluated periodically and continuation of treatment should be decided on \n\nan individual basis by the treating physician. In non-splenectomised patients this should include \n\nevaluation relative to splenectomy. The reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia is possible upon \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nChronic hepatitis C (HCV) associated thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nWhen eltrombopag is given in combination with antivirals reference should be made to the full \n\nsummary of product characteristics of the respective coadministered medicinal products for \n\ncomprehensive details of relevant safety information or contraindications. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, platelet counts generally began to increase within 1 week of starting eltrombopag. \n\nThe aim of treatment with eltrombopag should be to achieve the minimum level of platelet counts \n\nneeded to initiate antiviral therapy, in adherence to clinical practice recommendations. During antiviral \n\ntherapy, the aim of treatment should be to keep platelet counts at a level that prevents the risk of \n\nbleeding complications, normally around 50,000-75,000/\u00b5l. Platelet counts >75,000/\u00b5l should be \n\navoided. The lowest dose of eltrombopag needed to achieve the targets should be used. Dose \n\nadjustments are based upon the platelet count response. \n\n \n\nInitial dose regimen \n\nEltrombopag should be initiated at a dose of 25 mg once daily. No dosage adjustment is necessary for \n\nHCV patients of Asian ancestry or patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMonitoring and dose adjustment \n\nThe dose of eltrombopag should be adjusted in 25 mg increments every 2 weeks as necessary to \n\nachieve the target platelet count required to initiate antiviral therapy. Platelet counts should be \n\nmonitored every week prior to starting antiviral therapy. On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet \n\ncount may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose adjustments should be avoided (see Table 2). \n\n \n\nDuring antiviral therapy, the dose of eltrombopag should be adjusted as necessary to avoid dose \n\nreductions of peginterferon due to decreasing platelet counts that may put patients at risk of bleeding \n\n(see Table 2). Platelet counts should be monitored weekly during antiviral therapy until a stable \n\nplatelet count is achieved, normally around 50,000-75,000/\u00b5l. FBCs including platelet counts and \n\nperipheral blood smears should be obtained monthly thereafter. Dose reductions on the daily dose by \n\n25 mg should be considered if platelet counts exceed the required target. It is recommended to wait for \n\n2 weeks to assess the effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments. \n\n \n\nA dose of 100 mg eltrombopag once daily must not be exceeded. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in HCV patients during antiviral therapy \n\n \n\nPlatelet count Dose adjustment or response \n\n<50,000/\u00b5l following at least \n\n2 weeks of therapy \n\nIncrease daily dose by 25 mg to a maximum of 100 mg/day. \n\n\u226550,000/\u00b5l to \u2264100,000/\u00b5l Use lowest dose of eltrombopag as necessary to avoid dose \n\nreductions of peginterferon. \n\n>100,000/\u00b5l to \u2264150,000/\u00b5l Decrease the daily dose by 25 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the \n\neffects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments\u2666. \n\n>150,000/\u00b5l Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring to \n\ntwice weekly. \n\n \n\nOnce the platelet count is \u2264100,000/\u00b5l, reinitiate therapy at a daily \n\ndose reduced by 25 mg*. \n\n* For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once daily, consideration should be given to reinitiating \n\ndosing at 25 mg every other day. \n\u2666 On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet count may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose \n\nreductions should be avoided. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n40 \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nIf after 2 weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 100 mg the required platelet level to initiate antiviral \n\ntherapy is not achieved, eltrombopag should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag treatment should be terminated when antiviral therapy is discontinued unless otherwise \n\njustified. Excessive platelet count responses or important liver test abnormalities also necessitate \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nSevere aplastic anaemia \n\n \n\nInitial dose regimen \n\nEltrombopag should be initiated at a dose of 50 mg once daily. For patients of Asian ancestry, \n\neltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily (see section 5.2). The treatment \n\nshould not be initiated when the patients has existing cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 7. \n\n \n\nMonitoring and dose adjustment \n\nHaematological response requires dose titration, generally up to 150 mg, and may take up to 16 weeks \n\nafter starting eltrombopag (see section 5.1). The dose of eltrombopag should be adjusted in 50 mg \n\nincrements every 2 weeks as necessary to achieve the target platelet count \u226550,000/\u00b5l. For patients \n\ntaking 25 mg once daily, the dose should be increased to 50 mg daily before increasing the dose \n\namount by 50 mg. A dose of 150 mg daily must not be exceeded. Clinical haematology and liver tests \n\nshould be monitored regularly throughout therapy with eltrombopag and the dosage regimen of \n\neltrombopag modified based on platelet counts as outlined in Table 3. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in patients with severe aplastic anaemia \n\n \n\nPlatelet count Dose adjustment or response \n\n<50,000/\u00b5l following at least \n\n2 weeks of therapy \n\nIncrease daily dose by 50 mg to a maximum of 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nFor patients taking 25 mg once daily, increase the dose to \n\n50 mg daily before increasing the dose amount by 50 mg. \n\n\uf0b350,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3150,000/\u00b5l Use lowest dose of eltrombopag to maintain platelet counts. \n\n>150,000/\u00b5l to \uf0a3250,000/\u00b5l Decrease the daily dose by 50 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the \n\neffects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments. \n\n>250,000/\u00b5l Stop eltrombopag; for at least one week. \n\n \n\nOnce the platelet count is \u2264100,000/\u00b5l, reinitiate therapy at a \n\ndaily dose reduced by 50 mg. \n\n \n\nTapering for tri-lineage (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) responders \n\nFor patients who achieve tri-lineage response, including transfusion independence, lasting at least \n\n8 weeks: the dose of eltrombopag may be reduced by 50%. \n\n \n\nIf counts remain stable after 8 weeks at the reduced dose, then eltrombopag must be discontinued and \n\nblood counts monitored. If platelet counts drop to <30,000/\u00b5l, haemoglobin drops to <9 g/dl or \n\nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) to <0.5 x 109/l, eltrombopag may be reinitiated at the previous \n\neffective dose. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nIf no haematological response has occurred after 16 weeks of therapy with eltrombopag, therapy \n\nshould be discontinued. If new cytogenetic abnormalities are detected, it must be evaluated whether \n\ncontinuation of eltrombopag is appropriate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Excessive platelet count \n\nresponses (as outlined in Table 3) or important liver test abnormalities also necessitate discontinuation \n\nof eltrombopag (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Patients with impaired renal \n\nfunction should use eltrombopag with caution and close monitoring, for example by testing serum \n\ncreatinine and/or performing urine analysis (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nEltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22655) unless \n\nthe expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIf the use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary for ITP patients with hepatic impairment the starting \n\ndose must be 25 mg once daily. After initiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment an interval of 3 weeks should be observed before increasing the dose. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV and mild hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh score \u22646). Chronic HCV patients and severe aplastic anaemia patients with \n\nhepatic impairment should initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily (see section 5.2). After \n\ninitiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic impairment an interval of 2 weeks should be \n\nobserved before increasing the dose. \n\n \n\nThere is an increased risk for adverse events, including hepatic decompensation and thromboembolic \n\nevents, in thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic liver disease treated with eltrombopag, \n\neither in preparation for invasive procedure or in HCV patients undergoing antiviral therapy (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThere are limited data on the use of eltrombopag in ITP patients aged 65 years and older and no \n\nclinical experience in ITP patients aged over 85 years. In the clinical studies of eltrombopag, overall \n\nno clinically significant differences in safety of eltrombopag were observed between patients aged at \n\nleast 65 years and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in \n\nresponses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals \n\ncannot be ruled out (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere are limited data on the use of eltrombopag in HCV and SAA patients aged over 75 years. \n\nCaution should be exercised in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAsian patients \n\nFor patients of Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean or Thai), including \n\nthose with hepatic impairment, eltrombopag should be initiated at a dose of 25 mg once daily (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatient platelet count should continue to be monitored and the standard criteria for further dose \n\nmodification followed. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nRevolade is not recommended for use in children under the age of one year with ITP due to \n\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy. The safety and efficacy of eltrombopag has not been \n\nestablished in children and adolescents (<18 years) with chronic HCV related thrombocytopenia or \n\nSAA. No data are available. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n42 \n\nMethod of administration (see section 6.6) \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\nThe suspension should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as \n\nantacids, dairy products (or other calcium containing food products), or mineral supplements \n\ncontaining polyvalent cations (e.g. iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc) (see \n\nsections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to eltrombopag or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThere is an increased risk for adverse reactions, including potentially fatal hepatic decompensation and \n\nthromboembolic events, in thrombocytopenic HCV patients with advanced chronic liver disease, as \n\ndefined by low albumin levels \u226435 g/l or model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score \u226510, when \n\ntreated with eltrombopag in combination with interferon-based therapy. In addition, the benefits of \n\ntreatment in terms of the proportion achieving sustained virological response (SVR) compared with \n\nplacebo were modest in these patients (especially for those with baseline albumin \u226435 g/l) compared \n\nwith the group overall. Treatment with eltrombopag in these patients should be initiated only by \n\nphysicians experienced in the management of advanced HCV, and only when the risks of \n\nthrombocytopenia or withholding antiviral therapy necessitate intervention. If treatment is considered \n\nclinically indicated, close monitoring of these patients is required. \n\n \n\nCombination with direct-acting antiviral agents \n\n \n\nSafety and efficacy have not been established in combination with direct-acting antiviral agents \n\napproved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. \n\n \n\nRisk of hepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag administration can cause abnormal liver function and severe hepatotoxicity, which might \n\nbe life-threatening (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSerum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) and bilirubin should be \n\nmeasured prior to initiation of eltrombopag, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase and \n\nmonthly following establishment of a stable dose. Eltrombopag inhibits UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, \n\nwhich may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinaemia. If bilirubin is elevated fractionation should be \n\nperformed. Abnormal serum liver tests should be evaluated with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If \n\nthe abnormalities are confirmed, serum liver tests should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve, \n\nstabilise, or return to baseline levels. Eltrombopag should be discontinued if ALT levels increase \n\n(\uf0b33 times the upper limit of normal [x ULN] in patients with normal liver function, or \u22653 x baseline or \n\n>5 x ULN, whichever is the lower, in patients with pre-treatment elevations in transaminases) and are: \n\n\uf0b7 progressive, or \n\n\uf0b7 persistent for \u22654 weeks, or \n\n\uf0b7 accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or \n\n\uf0b7 accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. \n \n\nCaution is required when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic disease. In ITP and SAA \n\npatients a lower starting dose of eltrombopag should be used. Close monitoring is required when \n\nadministering to patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n43 \n\nHepatic decompensation (use with interferon) \n\n \n\nHepatic decompensation in patients with chronic hepatitis C: Monitoring is required in patients with \n\nlow albumin levels (\u226435 g/l) or with MELD score \u226510 at baseline. \n\n \n\nChronic HCV patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving alfa \n\ninterferon therapy. In 2 controlled clinical studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV, hepatic \n\ndecompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial \n\nperitonitis) occurred more frequently in the eltrombopag arm (11%) than in the placebo arm (6%). In \n\npatients with low albumin levels (\u226435 g/l) or with a MELD score \u226510 at baseline, there was a 3-fold \n\ngreater risk of hepatic decompensation and an increase in the risk of a fatal adverse event compared to \n\nthose with less advanced liver disease. In addition, the benefits of treatment in terms of the proportion \n\nachieving SVR compared with placebo were modest in these patients (especially for those with \n\nbaseline albumin \u226435 g/l) compared with the group overall. Eltrombopag should only be administered \n\nto such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. \n\nPatients with these characteristics should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic \n\ndecompensation. The respective interferon summary of product characteristics should be referenced \n\nfor discontinuation criteria. Eltrombopag should be terminated if antiviral therapy is discontinued for \n\nhepatic decompensation. \n\n \n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic complications \n\n \n\nIn controlled studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV receiving interferon-based therapy \n\n(n=1,439), 38 out of 955 patients (4%) treated with eltrombopag and 6 out of 484 patients (1%) in the \n\nplacebo group experienced thromboembolic events (TEEs). Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic \n\ncomplications included both venous and arterial events. The majority of TEEs were non-serious and \n\nresolved by the end of the study. Portal vein thrombosis was the most common TEE in both treatment \n\ngroups (2% in patients treated with eltrombopag versus <1% for placebo). No specific temporal \n\nrelationship between start of treatment and event of TEE were observed. Patients with low albumin \n\nlevels (\u226435 g/l) or MELD \u226510 had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs than those with higher albumin levels; \n\nthose aged \u226560 years had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs compared to younger patients. Eltrombopag \n\nshould only be administered to such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in \n\ncomparison with the risks. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of TEE. \n\n \n\nThe risk of TEEs has been found to be increased in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) treated \n\nwith 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures. Six of 143 \n\n(4%) adult patients with CLD receiving eltrombopag experienced TEEs (all of the portal venous \n\nsystem) and 2 of 145 (1%) patients in the placebo group experienced TEEs (one in the portal venous \n\nsystem and one myocardial infarction). Five of the 6 patients treated with eltrombopag experienced the \n\nthrombotic complication at a platelet count >200,000/\u00b5l and within 30 days of the last dose of \n\neltrombopag. Eltrombopag is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with \n\nchronic liver disease in preparation for invasive procedures. \n\n \n\nIn eltrombopag clinical studies in ITP thromboembolic events were observed at low and normal \n\nplatelet counts. Caution should be used when administering eltrombopag to patients with known risk \n\nfactors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. Factor V Leiden) or acquired \n\nrisk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), advanced age, patients with prolonged \n\nperiods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, \n\nsurgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. Platelet counts should be closely monitored and consideration \n\ngiven to reducing the dose or discontinuing eltrombopag treatment if the platelet count exceeds the \n\ntarget levels (see section 4.2). The risk-benefit balance should be considered in patients at risk of TEEs \n\nof any aetiology. \n\n \n\nNo case of TEE was identified from a clinical study in refractory SAA, however the risk of these \n\nevents cannot be excluded in this patient population due to the limited number of exposed patients. As \n\nthe highest authorised dose is indicated for patients with SAA (150 mg/day) and due to the nature of \n\nthe reaction, TEEs might be expected in this patient population. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nEltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22655) unless \n\nthe expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis. When treatment is \n\nconsidered appropriate, caution is required when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nBleeding following discontinuation of eltrombopag \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia is likely to reoccur in ITP patients upon discontinuation of treatment with \n\neltrombopag. Following discontinuation of eltrombopag, platelet counts return to baseline levels \n\nwithin 2 weeks in the majority of patients, which increases the bleeding risk and in some cases may \n\nlead to bleeding. This risk is increased if eltrombopag treatment is discontinued in the presence of \n\nanticoagulants or anti-platelet agents. It is recommended that, if treatment with eltrombopag is \n\ndiscontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according to current treatment guidelines. Additional medical \n\nmanagement may include cessation of anticoagulant and/or anti-platelet therapy, reversal of \n\nanticoagulation, or platelet support. Platelet counts must be monitored weekly for 4 weeks following \n\ndiscontinuation of eltrombopag. \n\n \n\nIn HCV clinical studies, a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, including serious and fatal \n\ncases, was reported following discontinuation of peginterferon, ribavirin, and eltrombopag. Following \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy, patients should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal \n\nbleeding. \n\n \n\nBone marrow reticulin formation and risk of bone marrow fibrosis \n\n \n\nEltrombopag may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fibres within the bone \n\nmarrow. The relevance of this finding, as with other thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists, has \n\nnot been established yet. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiation of eltrombopag, the peripheral blood smear should be examined closely to establish \n\na baseline level of cellular morphologic abnormalities. Following identification of a stable dose of \n\neltrombopag, full blood count (FBC) with white blood cell count (WBC) differential should be \n\nperformed monthly. If immature or dysplastic cells are observed, peripheral blood smears should be \n\nexamined for new or worsening morphological abnormalities (e.g. teardrop and nucleated red blood \n\ncells, immature white blood cells) or cytopenia(s). If the patient develops new or worsening \n\nmorphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s), treatment with eltrombopag should be discontinued and \n\na bone marrow biopsy considered, including staining for fibrosis. \n\n \n\nProgression of existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) \n\n \n\nThere is a theoretical concern that TPO-R agonists may stimulate the progression of existing \n\nhaematological malignancies such as MDS. TPO-R agonists are growth factors that lead to \n\nthrombopoietic progenitor cell expansion, differentiation and platelet production. The TPO-R is \n\npredominantly expressed on the surface of cells of the myeloid lineage. For TPO-R agonists there is a \n\nconcern that they may stimulate the progression of existing haematopoietic malignancies such as \n\nMDS. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with a TPO-R agonist in patients with MDS, cases of transient increases in blast cell \n\ncounts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nThe diagnosis of ITP or SAA in adults and elderly patients should be confirmed by the exclusion of \n\nother clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be \n\nexcluded. Consideration should be given to performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy over the \n\ncourse of the disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, those with systemic \n\nsymptoms, or abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nThe effectiveness and safety of Revolade have not been established for the treatment of \n\nthrombocytopenia due to MDS. Revolade should not be used outside of clinical studies for the \n\ntreatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS. \n\n \n\nCytogenetic abnormalities and progression to MDS/AML in patients with SAA \n\n \n\nCytogenetic abnormalities are known to occur in SAA patients. It is not known whether eltrombopag \n\nincreases the risk of cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with SAA. In the phase II refractory SAA \n\nclinical study with eltrombopag with a starting dose of 50 mg/day (escalated every 2 weeks to a \n\nmaximum of 150 mg/day) (ELT112523), the incidence of new cytogenetic abnormalities was \n\nobserved in 17.1% of patients [7/41 (where 4 of them had changes in chromosome 7)]. The median \n\ntime on study to a cytogenetic abnormality was 2.9 months. \n\n \n\nIn the phase II refractory SAA clinical study with eltrombopag at a dose of 150 mg/day (with ethnic or \n\nage related modifications as indicated) (ELT116826), the incidence of new cytogenetic abnormalities \n\nwas observed in 22.6% of adult patients [7/31 (where 3 of them had changes in chromosome 7)]. All \n\n7 patients had normal cytogenetics at baseline. Six patients had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 3 of \n\neltrombopag therapy and one patient had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 6. \n \n\nIn clinical studies with eltrombopag in SAA, 4% of patients (5/133) were diagnosed with MDS. The \n\nmedian time to diagnosis was 3 months from the start of eltrombopag treatment. \n\n \n\nFor SAA patients refractory to or heavily pretreated with prior immunosuppressive therapy, bone \n\nmarrow examination with aspirations for cytogenetics is recommended prior to initiation of \n\neltrombopag, at 3 months of treatment and 6 months thereafter. If new cytogenetic abnormalities are \n\ndetected, it must be evaluated whether continuation of eltrombopag is appropriate. \n\n \n\nOcular changes \n\n \n\nCataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents (see section 5.3). In \n\ncontrolled studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV receiving interferon therapy (n=1,439), \n\nprogression of pre-existing baseline cataract(s) or incident cataracts was reported in 8% of the \n\neltrombopag group and 5% of the placebo group. Retinal haemorrhages, mostly Grade 1 or 2, have \n\nbeen reported in HCV patients receiving interferon, ribavirin and eltrombopag (2% of the eltrombopag \n\ngroup and 2% of the placebo group. Haemorrhages occurred on the surface of the retina (preretinal), \n\nunder the retina (subretinal), or within the retinal tissue. Routine ophthalmologic monitoring of \n\npatients is recommended. \n\n \n\nQT/QTc prolongation \n\n \n\nA QTc study in healthy volunteers dosed 150 mg eltrombopag per day did not show a clinically \n\nsignificant effect on cardiac repolarisation. QTc interval prolongation has been reported in clinical \n\nstudies of patients with ITP and thrombocytopenic patients with HCV. The clinical significance of \n\nthese QTc prolongation events is unknown. \n\n \n\nLoss of response to eltrombopag \n\n \n\nA loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with eltrombopag treatment within the \n\nrecommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including an increased bone \n\nmarrow reticulin. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe above warnings and precautions for ITP also apply to the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nInterference with laboratory tests \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is highly coloured and so has the potential to interfere with some laboratory tests. Serum \n\ndiscolouration and interference with total bilirubin and creatinine testing have been reported in \n\npatients taking Revolade. If the laboratory results and clinical observations are inconsistent, re-testing \n\nusing another method may help in determining the validity of the result. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEffects of eltrombopag on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nHMG CoA reductase inhibitors \n\n \n\nAdministration of eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 5 days with a single 10 mg dose of the OATP1B1 \n\nand BCRP substrate rosuvastatin to 39 healthy adult subjects increased plasma rosuvastatin Cmax 103% \n\n(90% confidence interval [CI]: 82%, 126%) and AUC0-\uf0a5 55% (90% CI: 42%, 69%). Interactions are \n\nalso expected with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, \n\npravastatin and simvastatin. When co-administered with eltrombopag, a reduced dose of statins should \n\nbe considered and careful monitoring for statin adverse reactions should be undertaken (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nOATP1B1 and BCRP substrates \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of eltrombopag and OATP1B1 (e.g. methotrexate) and BCRP (e.g. \n\ntopotecan and methotrexate) substrates should be undertaken with caution (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 substrates \n\n \n\nIn studies utilising human liver microsomes, eltrombopag (up to 100 \uf06dM) showed no in vitro \n\ninhibition of the CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, and 4A9/11 and was an \n\ninhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 as measured using paclitaxel and diclofenac as the probe \n\nsubstrates. Administration of eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 7 days to 24 healthy male subjects did \n\nnot inhibit or induce the metabolism of probe substrates for 1A2 (caffeine), 2C19 (omeprazole), 2C9 \n\n(flurbiprofen), or 3A4 (midazolam) in humans. No clinically significant interactions are expected \n\nwhen eltrombopag and CYP450 substrates are co-administered (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHCV protease inhibitors \n\n \n\nDose adjustment is not required when eltrombopag is co-administered with either telaprevir or \n\nboceprevir. Co-administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg with telaprevir 750 mg every \n\n8 hours did not alter plasma telaprevir exposure. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg with boceprevir 800 mg every 8 hours did \n\nnot alter plasma boceprevir AUC(0-\uf074), but increased Cmax by 20%, and decreased Cmin by 32%. The \n\nclinical relevance of the decrease in Cmin has not been established, increased clinical and laboratory \n\nmonitoring for HCV suppression is recommended. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n47 \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on eltrombopag \n\n \n\nCiclosporin \n\n \nA decrease in eltrombopag exposure was observed with co-administration of 200 mg and 600 mg \n\nciclosporin (a BCRP inhibitor). The co-administration of 200 mg ciclosporin decreased the Cmax and \n\nthe AUCinf of eltrombopag by 25% and 18%, respectively. The co-administration of 600 mg \n\nciclosporin decreased the Cmax and the AUCinf of eltrombopag by 39% and 24%, respectively. \n\nEltrombopag dose adjustment is permitted during the course of the treatment based on the patient\u2019s \n\nplatelet count (see section 4.2). Platelet count should be monitored at least weekly for 2 to 3 weeks \n\nwhen eltrombopag is co-administered with ciclosporin. Eltrombopag dose may need to be increased \n\nbased on these platelet counts. \n\n \n\nPolyvalent cations (chelation) \n\n \n\nEltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium \n\nand zinc. Administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 75 mg with a polyvalent cation-containing \n\nantacid (1524 mg aluminium hydroxide and 1425 mg magnesium carbonate) decreased plasma \n\neltrombopag AUC0-\uf0a5 by 70% (90% CI: 64%, 76%) and Cmax by 70% (90% CI: 62%, 76%). \n\nEltrombopag should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as \n\nantacids, dairy products or mineral supplements containing polyvalent cations to avoid significant \n\nreduction in eltrombopag absorption due to chelation (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nLopinavir/ritonavir \n\n \n\nCo-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir may cause a decrease in the concentration \n\nof eltrombopag. A study in 40 healthy volunteers showed that the co-administration of a single 100 mg \n\ndose of eltrombopag with repeat dose lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily resulted in a \n\nreduction in eltrombopag plasma AUCinf by 17% (90% CI: 6.6%, 26.6%). Therefore, caution should \n\nbe used when co-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir takes place. Platelet count \n\nshould be closely monitored in order to ensure appropriate medical management of the dose of \n\neltrombopag when lopinavir/ritonavir therapy is initiated or discontinued. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 and CYP2C8 inhibitors and inducers \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is metabolised through multiple pathways including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and \n\nUGT1A3 (see section 5.2). Medicinal products that inhibit or induce a single enzyme are unlikely to \n\nsignificantly affect plasma eltrombopag concentrations, whereas medicinal products that inhibit or \n\ninduce multiple enzymes have the potential to increase (e.g. fluvoxamine) or decrease (e.g. rifampicin) \n\neltrombopag concentrations. \n\n \n\nHCV protease inhibitors \n\n \n\nResults of a drug-drug pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction study show that co-administration of repeat \n\ndoses of boceprevir 800 mg every 8 hours or telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours with a single dose of \n\neltrombopag 200 mg did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure to a clinically significant extent. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products for treatment of ITP \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with eltrombopag in clinical studies \n\nincluded corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and \n\nanti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining eltrombopag with other \n\nmedicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the \n\nrecommended range (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nFood interaction \n\n \n\nThe administration of eltrombopag tablet or powder for oral suspension formulations with a high-\n\ncalcium meal (e.g. a meal that included dairy products) significantly reduced plasma eltrombopag \n\nAUC0-\u221e and Cmax. In contrast, the administration of eltrombopag 2 hours before or 4 hours after a high-\n\ncalcium meal or with low-calcium food [<50 mg calcium] did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure \n\nto a clinically significant extent (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAdministration of a single 50 mg dose of eltrombopag in tablet form with a standard high-calorie, \n\nhigh-fat breakfast that included dairy products reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC0-\u221e by 59% and \n\nmean Cmax by 65%. \n\n \n\nAdministration of a single 25 mg dose of eltrombopag as powder for oral suspension with a high-\n\ncalcium, moderate-fat and moderate-calorie meal reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC0-\u221e by 75% \n\nand mean Cmax by 79%. This decrease of exposure was attenuated when a single 25 mg dose of \n\neltrombopag powder for oral suspension was administered 2 hours before a high-calcium meal (mean \n\nAUC0-\u221e was decreased by 20% and mean Cmax by 14%). \n\n \n\nFood low in calcium (<50 mg calcium), including fruit, lean ham, beef and unfortified (no added \n\ncalcium, magnesium or iron) fruit juice, unfortified soya milk and unfortified grain, did not \n\nsignificantly impact plasma eltrombopag exposure, regardless of calorie and fat content (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of eltrombopag in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nRevolade is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nRevolade is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether eltrombopag/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have \n\nshown that eltrombopag is likely secreted into milk (see section 5.3); therefore a risk to the suckling \n\nchild cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \n\ncontinue/abstain from Revolade therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \n\nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nFertility was not affected in male or female rats at exposures that were comparable to those in humans. \n\nHowever a risk for humans cannot be ruled out (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEltrombopag has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of \n\nthe patient and the adverse reaction profile of eltrombopag, including dizziness and lack of alertness, \n\nshould be borne in mind when considering the patient\u2019s ability to perform tasks that require \n\njudgement, motor and cognitive skills. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nImmune thrombocytopenia in adult and paediatric patients \n\n \n\nThe safety of Revolade was assessed using the pooled double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \n\nTRA100773A and B, TRA102537 (RAISE) and TRA113765, in which 403 patients were exposed to \n\nRevolade and 179 to placebo, in addition to data from the completed open-label studies TRA108057, \n\nTRA105325 (EXTEND) and TRA112940. Patients received study medication for up to 8 years (in \n\nEXTEND). The most important serious adverse reactions were hepatotoxicity and \n\nthrombotic/thromboembolic events. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of \n\npatients included nausea, diarrhoea and increased alanine aminotransferase. \n\n \n\nThe safety of Revolade in paediatric patients (aged 1 to 17 years) with previously treated ITP has been \n\ndemonstrated in two studies. PETIT2 (TRA115450) was a 2-part, double-blind and open-label, \n\nrandomised, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomised 2:1 and received Revolade (n=63) or \n\nplacebo (n=29) for up to 13 weeks in the randomised period of the study. PETIT (TRA108062) was a \n\n3-part, staggered-cohort, open-label and double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. Patients \n\nwere randomised 2:1 and received Revolade (n=44) or placebo (n=21), for up to 7 weeks. The profile \n\nof adverse reactions was comparable to that seen in adults with some additional adverse reactions, \n\nmarked \u2666 in the table below. The most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and \n\nolder (\u22653% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, \n\npyrexia, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, toothache and rhinorrhoea. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia with HCV infection in adult patients \n\n \n\nENABLE 1 (TPL103922 n=716) and ENABLE 2 (TPL108390 n=805) were randomised, double-\n\nblind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies to assess the efficacy and safety of Revolade in \n\nthrombocytopenic patients with HCV infection who were otherwise eligible to initiate antiviral \n\ntherapy. In the HCV studies the safety population consisted of all randomised patients who received \n\ndouble-blind study medicinal product during Part 2 of ENABLE 1 (Revolade treatment n=450, \n\nplacebo treatment n=232) and ENABLE 2 (Revolade treatment n=506, placebo treatment n=253). \n\nPatients are analysed according to the treatment received (total safety double-blind population, \n\nRevolade n=955 and placebo n=484). The most important serious adverse reactions identified were \n\nhepatotoxicity and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. The most common adverse reactions occurring \n\nin at least 10% of patients included headache, anaemia, decreased appetite, cough, nausea, diarrhoea, \n\nhyperbilirubinaemia, alopecia, pruritus, myalgia, pyrexia, fatigue, influenza-like illness, asthenia, \n\nchills and oedema. \n\n \n\nSevere aplastic anaemia in adult patients \n\n \n\nThe safety of eltrombopag in severe aplastic anaemia was assessed in a single-arm, open-label study \n\n(N=43) in which 11 patients (26%) were treated for >6 months and 7 patients (16%) were treated for \n\n>1 year. The most important serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia and sepsis/infection. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included headache, \n\ndizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, transaminases increased, \n\narthralgia, pain in extremity, fatigue and pyrexia. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n50 \n\nList of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions in the adult ITP studies (N=763), paediatric ITP studies (N=171), the HCV \n\nstudies (N=1,520), the SAA studies (N=43) and post-marketing reports are listed below by MedDRA \n\nsystem organ class and by frequency. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are \n\nranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first.

\n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic events (TEEs) \n\n \n\nIn 3 controlled and 2 uncontrolled clinical studies among adult ITP patients receiving eltrombopag \n\n(n=446), 17 patients experienced a total of 19 TEEs, which included (in descending order of \n\noccurrence) deep vein thrombosis (n=6), pulmonary embolism (n=6), acute myocardial infarction \n\n(n=2), cerebral infarction (n=2), embolism (n=1) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn a placebo-controlled study (n=288, Safety population), following 2 weeks\u2019 treatment in preparation \n\nfor invasive procedures, 6 of 143 (4%) adult patients with chronic liver disease receiving eltrombopag \n\nexperienced 7 TEEs of the portal venous system and 2 of 145 (1%) patients in the placebo group \n\nexperienced 3 TEEs. Five of the 6 patients treated with eltrombopag experienced the TEE at a platelet \n\ncount >200,000/\u00b5l. \n\n \n\nNo specific risk factors were identified in those patients who experienced a TEE with the exception of \n\nplatelet counts \u2265200,000/\u00b5l (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nIn controlled studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV (n=1439), 38 out of 955 patients (4%) \n\ntreated with eltrombopag experienced a TEE and 6 out of 484 patients (1%) in the placebo group \n\nexperienced TEEs. Portal vein thrombosis was the most common TEE in both treatment groups (2% in \n\npatients treated with eltrombopag versus <1% for placebo) (see section 4.4). Patients with low albumin \n\nlevels (\u226435 g/l) or MELD \u226510 had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs than those with higher albumin levels; \n\nthose aged \u226560 years had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs compared to younger patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic decompensation (use with interferon) \n\n \n\nChronic HCV patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving alfa \n\ninterferon therapy. In 2 controlled clinical studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV, hepatic \n\ndecompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial \n\nperitonitis) was reported more frequently in the eltrombopag arm (11%) than in the placebo arm (6%). \n\nIn patients with low albumin levels (\u226435 g/l) or MELD score \u226510 at baseline, there was a 3-fold \n\ngreater risk of hepatic decompensation and an increase in the risk of a fatal adverse event compared to \n\nthose with less advanced liver disease. Eltrombopag should only be administered to such patients after \n\ncareful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. Patients with these \n\ncharacteristics should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatotoxixity \n\n \n\nIn the controlled clinical studies in chronic ITP with eltrombopag, increases in serum ALT, AST and \n\nbilirubin were observed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThese findings were mostly mild (Grade 1-2), reversible and not accompanied by clinically significant \n\nsymptoms that would indicate an impaired liver function. Across the 3 placebo-controlled studies in \n\nadults with chronic ITP, 1 patient in the placebo group and 1 patient in the eltrombopag group \n\nexperienced a Grade 4 liver test abnormality. In two placebo-controlled studies in paediatric patients \n\n(aged 1 to 17 years) with chronic ITP, ALT \uf0b33 x ULN was reported in 4.7% and 0% of the \n\neltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn 2 controlled clinical studies in patients with HCV, ALT or AST \uf0b33 x ULN was reported in 34% and \n\n38% of the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. Most patients receiving eltrombopag in \n\ncombination with peginterferon / ribavirin therapy will experience indirect hyperbilirubinaemia. \n\nOverall, total bilirubin \u22651.5 x ULN was reported in 76% and 50% of the eltrombopag and placebo \n\ngroups, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn the single-arm phase II monotherapy refractory SAA study, concurrent ALT or AST >3 x ULN \n\nwith total (indirect) bilirubin >1.5 x ULN were reported in 5% of patients. Total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN \n\noccurred in 14% of patients. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia following discontinuation of treatment \n\n \n\nIn the 3 controlled clinical ITP studies, transient decreases in platelet counts to levels lower than \n\nbaseline were observed following discontinuation of treatment in 8% and 8% of the eltrombopag and \n\nplacebo groups, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIncreased bone marrow reticulin \n\n \n\nAcross the programme, no patients had evidence of clinically relevant bone marrow abnormalities or \n\nclinical findings that would indicate bone marrow dysfunction. In a small number of ITP patients, \n\neltrombopag treatment was discontinued due to bone marrow reticulin (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nCytogenetic abnormalities \n\n \n\nIn the phase II refractory SAA clinical study with eltrombopag with a starting dose of 50 mg/day \n\n(escalated every 2 weeks to a maximum of 150 mg/day) (ELT112523), the incidence of new \n\ncytogenetic abnormalities was observed in 17.1% of adult patients [7/41 (where 4 of them had changes \n\nin chromosome 7)]. The median time on study to a cytogenetic abnormality was 2.9 months. \n\n \n\nIn the phase II refractory SAA clinical study with eltrombopag at a dose of 150 mg/day (with ethnic or \n\nage related modifications as indicated) (ELT116826), the incidence of new cytogenetic abnormalities \n\nwas observed in 22.6% of adult patients [7/31 (where 3 of them had changes in chromosome 7)]. All \n\n7 patients had normal cytogenetics at baseline. Six patients had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 3 of \n\neltrombopag therapy and one patient had cytogenetic abnormality at Month 6. \n\n \n\nHaematologic malignancies \n\n \n\nIn the single-arm, open-label study in SAA, three (7%) patients were diagnosed with MDS following \n\ntreatment with eltrombopag, in the two ongoing studies (ELT116826 and ELT116643), 1/28 (4%) and \n\n1/62 (2%) patient has been diagnosed with MDS or AML in each study. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase excessively and result in \n\nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications. In case of an overdose, consideration should be given to \n\noral administration of a metal cation-containing preparation, such as calcium, aluminium, or \n\nmagnesium preparations to chelate eltrombopag and thus limit absorption. Platelet counts should be \n\nclosely monitored. Treatment with eltrombopag should be reinitiated in accordance with dosing and \n\nadministration recommendations (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn the clinical studies there was one report of overdose where the patient ingested 5000 mg of \n\neltrombopag. Reported adverse reactions included mild rash, transient bradycardia, ALT and AST \n\nelevation, and fatigue. Liver enzymes measured between Days 2 and 18 after ingestion peaked at a \n\n1.6-fold ULN in AST, a 3.9-fold ULN in ALT, and a 2.4-fold ULN in total bilirubin, The platelet \n\ncounts were 672,000/\u00b5l on Day 18 after ingestion and the maximum platelet count was 929,000/\u00b5l. All \n\nevents were resolved without sequelae following treatment. \n\n \n\nBecause eltrombopag is not significantly renally excreted and is highly bound to plasma proteins, \n\nhaemodialysis would not be expected to be an effective method to enhance the elimination of \n\neltrombopag. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics. ATC code: B02BX 05. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTPO is the main cytokine involved in regulation of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, and is \n\nthe endogenous ligand for the TPO-R. Eltrombopag interacts with the transmembrane domain of the \n\nhuman TPO-R and initiates signalling cascades similar but not identical to that of endogenous \n\nthrombopoietin (TPO), inducing proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitor cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nImmune (primary) thrombocytopenia (ITP) studies \n\n \n\nTwo phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies RAISE (TRA102537) and \n\nTRA100773B and two open-label studies REPEAT (TRA108057) and EXTEND (TRA105325) \n\nevaluated the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in adult patients with previously treated ITP. Overall, \n\neltrombopag was administered to 277 ITP patients for at least 6 months and 202 patients for at least \n\n1 year. \n\n \n\nDouble-blind placebo-controlled studies \n\nRAISE: 197 ITP patients were randomised 2:1, eltrombopag (n=135) to placebo (n=62), and \n\nrandomisation was stratified based upon splenectomy status, use of ITP medicinal products at baseline \n\nand baseline platelet count. The dose of eltrombopag was adjusted during the 6 month treatment \n\nperiod based on individual platelet counts. All patients initiated treatment with eltrombopag 50 mg. \n\nFrom Day 29 to the end of treatment, 15 to 28% of eltrombopag treated patients were maintained on \n\n\u226425 mg and 29 to 53% received 75 mg. \n\n \n\nIn addition, patients could taper off concomitant ITP medicinal products and receive rescue treatments \n\nas dictated by local standard of care. More than half of all patients in each treatment group had \u22653 \n\nprior ITP therapies and 36% had a prior splenectomy. \n\n \n\nMedian platelet counts at baseline were 16,000/\uf06dl for both treatment groups and in the eltrombopag \n\ngroup were maintained above 50,000/\u00b5l at all on-therapy visits starting at Day 15; in contrast, median \n\nplatelet counts in the placebo group remained <30,000/\u00b5l throughout the study. \n\n \n\nPlatelet count response between 50,000-400,000/\uf06dl in the absence of rescue treatment was achieved by \n\nsignificantly more patients in the eltrombopag treated group during the 6 month treatment period, \n\np <0.001. Fifty-four percent of the eltrombopag-treated patients and 13% of placebo-treated patients \n\nachieved this level of response after 6 weeks of treatment.

In \n\naddition, in the RAISE study, 42% of patients with baseline platelet count \u226415,000/\u03bcl treated with \n\neltrombopag responded at the end of the 6 month treatment period. Forty-two to 60% of the \n\neltrombopag-treated patients in the RAISE study were receiving 75 mg from Day 29 to the end of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nAn open-label, repeat-dose study (3 cycles of 6 weeks of treatment, followed by 4 weeks off \n\ntreatment) showed that episodic use with multiple courses of eltrombopag has demonstrated no loss of \n\nresponse. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag was administered to 302 ITP patients in the open-label extension study EXTEND \n\n(TRA105325), 218 patients completed 1 year, 180 completed 2 years, 107 completed 3 years, 75 \n\ncompleted 4 years, 34 completed 5 years and 18 completed 6 years. The median baseline platelet count \n\nwas 19,000/\uf06dl prior to eltrombopag administration. Median platelet counts at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and \n\n7 years on study were 85,000/\uf06dl, 85,000/\uf06dl, 105,000/\uf06dl, 64,000/\uf06dl, 75,000/\uf06dl, 119,000/\uf06dl and \n\n76,000/\uf06dl, respectively. \n\n \n\nClinical studies comparing eltrombopag to other treatment options (e.g. splenectomy) have not been \n\nconducted. The long-term safety of eltrombopag should be considered prior to starting therapy. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (aged 1 to 17 years) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in paediatric patients have been investigated two studies. \n\n \n\nTRA115450 (PETIT2): The primary endpoint was a sustained response, defined as the proportion of \n\npatients receiving eltrombopag, compared to placebo, achieving platelet counts \u226550,000/\u00b5l for at least \n\n6 out of 8 weeks (in the absence of rescue therapy), between weeks 5 to 12 during the double-blind \n\nrandomised period. Patients were diagnosed with chronic ITP for at least 1 year and were refractory or \n\nrelapsed to at least one prior ITP therapy or unable to continue other ITP treatments for a medical \n\nreason and had platelet count <30,000/\u00b5l. Ninety-two patients were randomised by three age cohort \n\nstrata (2:1) to eltrombopag (n=63) or placebo (n=29). The dose of eltrombopag could be adjusted \n\nbased on individual platelet counts. \n\n \n\nOverall, a significantly greater proportion of eltrombopag patients (40%) compared with placebo \n\npatients (3%) achieved the primary endpoint (Odds Ratio: 18.0 [95% CI: 2.3, 140.9] p <0.001) which \n\nwas similar across the three age cohorts (Table 6). \n\n \n\nTable 6 Sustained platelet response rates by age cohort in paediatric patients with chronic \n\nITP \n\n \n\n Eltrombopag \n\nn/N (%) \n\n[95% CI] \n\nPlacebo \n\nn/N (%) \n\n[95% CI] \n\nCohort 1 (12 to 17 years) \n\n \n\nCohort 2 (6 to 11 years) \n\n \n\nCohort 3 (1 to 5 years) \n\n9/23 (39%) \n\n[20%, 61%] \n\n11/26 (42%) \n\n[23%, 63%] \n\n5/14 (36%) \n\n[13%, 65%] \n\n1/10 (10%) \n\n[0%, 45%] \n\n0/13 (0%) \n\n[N/A] \n\n0/6 (0%) \n\n[N/A] \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nStatistically fewer eltrombopag patients required rescue treatment during the randomised period \n\ncompared to placebo patients (19% [12/63] vs. 24% [7/29], p=0.032). \n\n \n\nAt baseline, 71% of patients in the eltrombopag group and 69% in the placebo group reported any \n\nbleeding (WHO Grades 1-4). At Week 12, the proportion of eltrombopag patients reporting any \n\nbleeding was decreased to half of baseline (36%). In comparison, at Week 12, 55% of placebo patients \n\nreported any bleeding. \n\n \n\nPatients were permitted to reduce or discontinue baseline ITP therapy only during the open-label phase \n\nof the study and 53% (8/15) of patients were able to reduce (n=1) or discontinue (n=7) baseline ITP \n\ntherapy, mainly corticosteroids, without needing rescue therapy. \n\n \n\nTRA108062 (PETIT): The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving platelet counts \n\n\u226550,000/\u00b5l at least once between weeks 1 and 6 of the randomised period. Patients were diagnosed \n\nwith ITP for at least 6 months and were refractory or relapsed to at least one prior ITP therapy with a \n\nplatelet count <30,000/\u00b5l (n=67). During the randomised period of the study, patients were \n\nrandomised by three age cohort strata (2:1) to eltrombopag (n=45) or placebo (n=22). The dose of \n\neltrombopag could be adjusted based on individual platelet counts. \n\n \n\nOverall, a significantly greater proportion of eltrombopag patients (62%) compared with placebo \n\npatients (32%) met the primary endpoint (Odds Ratio: 4.3 [95% CI: 1.4, 13.3] p=0.011). \n\n \n\nSustained response was seen in 50% of the initial responders during 20 out of 24 weeks in the \n\nPETIT 2 study and 15 out of 24 weeks in the PETIT Study. \n\n \n\nChronic hepatitis C associated thrombocytopenia studies \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with HCV \n\ninfection were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. ENABLE 1 \n\nutilised peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for antiviral treatment and ENABLE 2 utilised \n\npeginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. Patients did not receive direct acting antiviral agents. In both \n\nstudies, patients with a platelet count of <75,000/\u00b5l were enrolled and stratified by platelet count \n\n(<50,000/\u00b5l and \u226550,000/\u00b5l to <75,000/\u00b5l), screening HCV RNA (<800,000 IU/ml and \n\n\u2265800,000 IU/ml), and HCV genotype (genotype 2/3, and genotype 1/4/6). \n\n \n\nBaseline disease characteristics were similar in both studies and were consistent with compensated \n\ncirrhotic HCV patient population. The majority of patients were HCV genotype 1 (64%) and had \n\nbridging fibrosis/cirrhosis. Thirty-one percent of patients had been treated with prior HCV therapies, \n\nprimarily pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. The median baseline platelet count was 59,500/\u00b5l in both \n\ntreatment groups: 0.8%, 28% and 72% of the patients recruited had platelet counts <20,000/\u00b5l, \n\n<50.000/\u00b5l and \u226550,000/\u00b5l respectively. \n\n \n\nThe studies consisted of two phases \u2013 a pre-antiviral treatment phase and an antiviral treatment phase. \n\nIn the pre-antiviral treatment phase, patients received open-label eltrombopag to increase the platelet \n\ncount to \u226590,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 1 and \u2265100,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 2. The median time to achieve the \n\ntarget platelet count \u226590,000/\u00b5l (ENABLE 1) or \u2265100,000/\u00b5l (ENABLE 2) was 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as the \n\npercentage of patients with no detectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after completion of the planned \n\ntreatment period. \n\n \n\nIn both HCV studies, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with eltrombopag (n=201, \n\n21%) achieved SVR compared to those treated with placebo (n=65, 13%) (see Table 7). The \n\nimprovement in the proportion of patients who achieved SVR was consistent across all subgroups in \n\nthe randomisation strata (baseline platelet counts (<50,000 vs. >50,000), viral load (<800,000 IU/ml \n\nvs. \u2265800,000 IU/ml) and genotype (2/3 vs. 1/4/6)). \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nTable 7 Virologic response in HCV patients in ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2 \n\n \n\n Pooled data ENABLE 1a ENABLE 2b \n\nPatients achieving \n\ntarget platelet counts \n\nand initiating antiviral \n\ntherapy c \n\n \n\n1,439/1,520 (95%) \n\n \n\n680/715 (95%) \n\n \n\n759/805 (94%) \n\n Eltrombopag Placebo Eltrombopag Placebo Eltrombopag Placebo \n\nTotal number of \n\npatients entering \n\nantiviral treatment \n\nphase \n\nn=956 n=485 n=450 n=232 n=506 n=253 \n\n % patients achieving virologic response \n\nOverall SVR d  21 13 23 14 19 13 \n\nHCV RNA Genotype       \n\nGenotype 2/3 35 25 35 24 34 25 \n\nGenotype 1/4/6e 15 8 18 10 13 7 \n\nAlbumin levels f    \n\n\u226435g/l 11 8 \n\n>35g/l 25 16 \n\nMELD scoref   \n\n\u226510 18 10 \n\n<10 23 17 \n\na Eltrombopag given in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (180 \u03bcg once weekly for \n\n48 weeks for genotypes 1/4/6; 24 weeks for genotype 2/3) plus ribavirin (800 to 1200 mg daily \n\nin 2 divided doses orally) \n\nb Eltrombopag given in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 \u03bcg/kg once weekly for \n\n48 weeks for genotype 1/4/6; 24 weeks for genotype 2/3) plus ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg orally \n\nin 2 divided doses) \n\nc Target platelet count was \uf0b390,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 1 and \uf0b3100,000/\u00b5l for ENABLE 2.

A greater proportion of patients on eltrombopag did not require any antiviral dose \n\nreduction as compared to placebo (45% vs. 27%). Eltrombopag treatment delayed and reduced the \n\nnumber of peginterferon dose reductions. \n\n \n\nSevere aplastic anaemia \n\n \n\nEltrombopag was studied in a single-arm, single-centre open-label study in 43 patients with severe \n\naplastic anaemia with refractory thrombocytopenia following at least one prior immunosuppressive \n\ntherapy (IST) and who had a platelet count \u226430,000/\u00b5l. \n\n \n\nThe majority of patients, 33 (77%), were considered to have \u2018primary refractory disease\u2019, defined as \n\nhaving no prior adequate response to IST in any lineage. The remaining 10 patients had insufficient \n\nplatelet response to prior therapies. All 10 had received at least 2 prior IST regimens and 50% had \n\nreceived at least 3 prior IST regimens. Patients with diagnosis of Fanconi anaemia, infection not \n\nresponding to appropriate therapy, PNH clone size in neutrophils of \u226550%, where excluded from \n\nparticipation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n61 \n\nAt baseline the median platelet count was 20,000/\u00b5l, haemoglobin was 8.4 g/dl, ANC was 0.58 x 109/l \n\nand absolute reticulocyte count was 24.3 x109/l. Eighty-six percent of patients were RBC transfusion \n\ndependent, and 91% were platelet transfusion dependent. The majority of patients (84%) had received \n\nat least 2 prior immunosuppressive therapies. Three patients had cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was haematological response assessed after 12 weeks of eltrombopag treatment. \n\nHaematological response was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria: 1) platelet \n\ncount increases to 20,000/\u00b5l above baseline or stable platelet counts with transfusion independence for \n\na minimum of 8 weeks; 2) haemoglobin increase by >1.5g/dl, or a reduction in \u22654 units of red blood \n\ncell (RBC) transfusions for 8 consecutive weeks; 3) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) increase of \n\n100% or an ANC increase >0.5 x 109/l. \n\n \n\nThe haematological response rate was 40% (17/43 patients; 95 % CI 25, 56), the majority were \n\nunilineage responses (13/17, 76%) whilst there were 3 bilineage and 1 trilineage responses at week 12. \n\nEltrombopag was discontinued after 16 weeks if no haematological response or transfusion \n\nindependence was observed. Patients who responded continued therapy in an extension phase of the \n\nstudy. A total of 14 patients entered the extension phase of the trial. Nine of these patients achieved a \n\nmulti-lineage response, 4 of the 9 remain on treatment and 5 tapered off treatment with eltrombopag \n\nand maintained the response (median follow up: 20.6 months, range: 5.7 to 22.5 months). The \n\nremaining 5 patients discontinued treatment, three due to relapse at the month 3 extension visit. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with eltrombopag 59% (23/39) became platelet transfusion independent (28 days \n\nwithout platelet transfusion) and 27% (10/37) became RBC transfusion independent (56 days without \n\nRBC transfusion). The longest platelet transfusion-free period for non-responders was 27 days \n\n(median). The longest platelet transfusion-free period for responders was 287 days (median). The \n\nlongest RBC transfusion-free period for non-responders was 29 days (median). The longest RBC \n\ntransfusion-free period for responders was 266 days (median). \n\n \n\nOver 50% of responders who were transfusion-dependent at baseline, had >80% reduction in both \n\nplatelet and RBC transfusion requirements compared to baseline. \n\n \n\nPreliminary results from a supportive study (Study ELT116826), an ongoing non-randomised, \n\nphase II, single-arm, open-label study in refractory SAA patients, showed consistent results. Data are \n\nlimited to 21 out of the planned 60 patients with haematological responses reported by 52% of patients \n\nat 6 months.

In a relative bioavailability study in adults, the eltrombopag powder for oral \n\nsuspension delivered 22% higher plasma AUC(0-\uf0a5) than the film-coated tablet formulation. The \n\nabsolute oral bioavailability of eltrombopag after administration to humans has not been established. \n\nBased on urinary excretion and metabolites eliminated in faeces, the oral absorption of drug-related \n\nmaterial following administration of a single 75 mg eltrombopag solution dose was estimated to be at \n\nleast 52%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99.9%), predominantly to albumin. \n\nEltrombopag is a substrate for BCRP, but is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein or OATP1B1. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEltrombopag is primarily metabolised through cleavage, oxidation and conjugation with glucuronic \n\nacid, glutathione, or cysteine. In a human radiolabel study, eltrombopag accounted for approximately \n\n64% of plasma radiocarbon AUC0-\uf0a5. Minor metabolites due to glucuronidation and oxidation were \n\nalso detected. In vitro studies suggest that CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 are responsible for oxidative \n\nmetabolism of eltrombopag. Uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 are \n\nresponsible for glucuronidation, and bacteria in the lower gastrointestinal tract may be responsible for \n\nthe cleavage pathway. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n63 \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAbsorbed eltrombopag is extensively metabolised. The predominant route of eltrombopag excretion is \n\nvia faeces (59%) with 31% of the dose found in the urine as metabolites. Unchanged parent compound \n\n(eltrombopag) is not detected in urine. Unchanged eltrombopag excreted in faeces accounts for \n\napproximately 20% of the dose. The plasma elimination half-life of eltrombopag is approximately \n\n21-32 hours. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nBased on a human study with radiolabelled eltrombopag, glucuronidation plays a minor role in the \n\nmetabolism of eltrombopag. Human liver microsome studies identified UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 as the \n\nenzymes responsible for eltrombopag glucuronidation. Eltrombopag was an inhibitor of a number of \n\nUGT enzymes in vitro. Clinically significant drug interactions involving glucuronidation are not \n\nanticipated due to limited contribution of individual UGT enzymes in the glucuronidation of \n\neltrombopag. \n\n \n\nApproximately 21% of an eltrombopag dose could undergo oxidative metabolism. Human liver \n\nmicrosome studies identified CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 as the enzymes responsible for eltrombopag \n\noxidation. Eltrombopag does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes based on in vitro and in vivo data \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrate that eltrombopag is an inhibitor of the OATP1B1 transporter and an \n\ninhibitor of the BCRP transporter and eltrombopag increased exposure of the OATP1B1 and BCRP \n\nsubstrate rosuvastatin in a clinical drug interaction study (see section 4.5). In clinical studies with \n\neltrombopag, a dose reduction of statins by 50% was recommended. \n\n \n\nEltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium \n\nand zinc (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that eltrombopag is not a substrate for the organic anion transporter \n\npolypeptide, OATP1B1, but is an inhibitor of this transporter (IC50 value of 2.7 \u03bcM (1.2 \u03bcg/ml). In \n\nvitro studies also demonstrated that eltrombopag is a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate \n\nand inhibitor (IC50 value of 2.7 \u03bcM (1.2 \u03bcg/ml). \n\n \n\nSpecial patient populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been studied after administration of eltrombopag to adult \n\npatients with renal impairment. Following administration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0-\uf0a5 of \n\neltrombopag was 32% to 36% lower in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, and 60% \n\nlower in patients with severe renal impairment compared with healthy volunteers. There was \n\nsubstantial variability and significant overlap in exposures between patients with renal impairment and \n\nhealthy volunteers. Unbound eltrombopag (active) concentrations for this highly protein-bound \n\nmedicinal product were not measured. Patients with impaired renal function should use eltrombopag \n\nwith caution and close monitoring, for example by testing serum creatinine and/or urine analysis (see \n\nsection 4.2). The efficacy and safety of eltrombopag have not been established in patients with both \n\nmoderate to severe renal impairment and hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n64 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been studied after administration of eltrombopag to adult \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. Following the administration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0-\uf0a5 of \n\neltrombopag was 41% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 80% to 93% higher in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy volunteers. There was \n\nsubstantial variability and significant overlap in exposures between patients with hepatic impairment \n\nand healthy volunteers. Unbound eltrombopag (active) concentrations for this highly protein-bound \n\nmedicinal product were not measured. \n\n \n\nThe influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag following repeat \n\nadministration was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 28 healthy adults and \n\n714 patients with hepatic impairment (673 patients with HCV and 41 patients with chronic liver \n\ndisease of other aetiology). Of the 714 patients, 642 were with mild hepatic impairment, 67 with \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 2 with severe hepatic impairment. Compared to healthy volunteers, \n\npatients with mild hepatic impairment had approximately 111% (95% CI: 45% to 283%) higher \n\nplasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values and patients with moderate hepatic impairment had \n\napproximately 183% (95% CI: 90% to 459%) higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values. \n\n \n\nTherefore, eltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \n\n\u22655) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). For patients with HCV initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nRace \n\n \n\nThe influence of Asian ethnicity (such as Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) on the \n\npharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 \n\nhealthy adults (31 Asians) and 88 patients with ITP (18 Asians). Based on estimates from the \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, Asian ITP patients had approximately 49% higher plasma \n\neltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values as compared to non-Asian patients who were predominantly Caucasian \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe influence of Asian ethnicity (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Thai) on the \n\npharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \n\n635 patients with HCV (145 Asians and 69 South Asians). Based on estimates from the population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis, Asian patients had approximately 55% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) \n\nvalues as compared to patients of other races who were predominantly Caucasian (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nGender \n\n \n\nThe influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (14 females) and 88 patients with ITP (57 females). \n\nBased on estimates from the population pharmacokinetic analysis, female ITP patients had \n\napproximately 23% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) as compared to male patients, without \n\nadjustment for body weight differences. \n\n \n\nThe influence of gender on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population \n\npharmacokinetics analysis in 635 patients with HCV (260 females). Based on model estimate, female \n\nHCV patient had approximately 41% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) as compared to male \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n65 \n\nAge \n\n \n\nThe influence of age on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population \n\npharmacokinetics analysis in 28 healthy subjects, 673 patients with HCV, and 41 patients with chronic \n\nliver disease of other aetiology ranging from 19 to 74 years old. There are no PK data on the use of \n\neltrombopag in patients \u226575 years. Based on model estimate, elderly (\u226565 years) patients had \n\napproximately 41% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) as compared to younger patients (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric Population (aged 1 to 17 years) \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been evaluated in 168 paediatric ITP patients dosed once \n\ndaily in two studies, TRA108062/PETIT and TRA115450/PETIT-2. Plasma eltrombopag apparent \n\nclearance following oral administration (CL/F) increased with increasing body weight. The effects of \n\nrace and sex on plasma eltrombopag CL/F estimates were consistent between paediatric and adult \n\npatients. Asian paediatric ITP patients had approximately 43% higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) \n\nvalues as compared to non-Asian patients. Female paediatric ITP patients had approximately 25% \n\nhigher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-\uf074) values as compared to male patients. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of eltrombopag in paediatric patients with ITP are shown in \n\nTable 10. \n\n \n\nTable 10 Geometric mean (95% CI) steady-state plasma eltrombopag pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in paediatric patients with ITP (50 mg once daily dosing regimen) \n\n \n\nAge Cmax \n(\u00b5g/ml) \n\nAUC(0-\uf074) \n(\u00b5g.hr/ml) \n\n12 to 17 years (n=62) 6.80 \n\n(6.17, 7.50) \n\n103 \n\n(91.1, 116) \n\n6 to 11 years (n=68) 10.3 \n\n(9.42, 11.2) \n\n153 \n\n(137, 170) \n\n1 to 5 years (n=38) 11.6 \n\n(10.4, 12.9) \n\n162 \n\n(139, 187) \n\nData presented as geometric mean (95% CI). AUC(0-\uf074) and Cmax based on population PK post-hoc \n\nestimates \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nSafety pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats or dogs because of unique TPO \n\nreceptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animals do not fully model potential adverse effects \n\nrelated to the pharmacology of eltrombopag in humans, including the reproduction and carcinogenicity \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nTreatment-related cataracts were detected in rodents and were dose and time-dependent. At \u22656 times \n\nthe human clinical exposure in adult ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in adult HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC, cataracts were observed in mice after \n\n6 weeks and rats after 28 weeks of dosing. At \uf0b34 times the human clinical exposure in ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and 2 times the human exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC, cataracts \n\nwere observed in mice after 13 weeks and in rats after 39 weeks of dosing. At non-tolerated doses in \n\npre-weaning juvenile rats dosed from days 4-32 (approximately equating to a 2-year-old human at the \n\nend of the dosing period), ocular opacities were observed (histology not performed) at 9 times the \n\nmaximum human clinical exposure in paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day, based on AUC. However, \n\ncataracts were not observed in juvenile rats given tolerated doses at 5 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in paediatric ITP patients, based on AUC. Cataracts have not been observed in adult dogs \n\nafter 52 weeks of dosing at 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at \n\n\n\n66 \n\n75 mg/day and equivalent to the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on \n\nAUC). \n\n \n\nRenal tubular toxicity was observed in studies of up to 14 days duration in mice and rats at exposures \n\nthat were generally associated with morbidity and mortality. Tubular toxicity was also observed in a \n\n2-year oral carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day. Effects were less \n\nsevere at lower doses and were characterised by a spectrum of regenerative changes. The exposure at \n\nthe lowest dose was 1.2 or 0.8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in adult or paediatric \n\nITP patients at 75 mg/day and 0.6 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, \n\nbased on AUC. Renal effects were not observed in rats after 28 weeks or in dogs after 52 weeks at \n\nexposures 4 and 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult ITP patients and 3 and 2 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 2 times and equivalent to the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nHepatocyte degeneration and/or necrosis, often accompanied by increased serum liver enzymes, was \n\nobserved in mice, rats and dogs at doses that were associated with morbidity and mortality or were \n\npoorly tolerated. No hepatic effects were observed after chronic dosing in rats (28 weeks) and in dogs \n\n(52 weeks) at 4 or 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult ITP and 3 or 2 times the human \n\nclinical exposure in paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 2 times and equivalent to the human \n\nclinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nAt poorly tolerated doses in rats and dogs (>10 or 7 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and>4 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC), decreased reticulocyte counts and regenerative bone marrow erythroid \n\nhyperplasia (rats only) were observed in short-term studies. There were no effects of note on red cell \n\nmass or reticulocyte counts after dosing for up to 28 weeks in rats, 52 weeks in dogs and 2 years in \n\nmice or rats at maximally tolerated doses which were 2 to 4 times human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and \u22642 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nEndosteal hyperostosis was observed in a 28-week toxicity study in rats at a non-tolerated dose of \n\n60 mg/kg/day (6 times or 4 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC). \n\nThere were no bone changes observed in mice or rats after lifetime exposure (2 years) at 4 times or \n\n2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 2 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag was not carcinogenic in mice at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to \n\n40 mg/kg/day (exposures up to 4 or 2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP \n\npatients at 75 mg/day and 2 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based \n\non AUC). Eltrombopag was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a bacterial mutation assay or in two in \n\nvivo assays in rats (micronucleus and unscheduled DNA synthesis, 10 times or 8 times the human \n\nclinical exposure in adult or paediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 7 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on Cmax). In the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, \n\neltrombopag was marginally positive (<3-fold increase in mutation frequency). These in vitro and in \n\nvivo findings suggest that eltrombopag does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n67 \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nEltrombopag did not affect female fertility, early embryonic development or embryofoetal \n\ndevelopment in rats at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (2 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\nadolescent (12-17 years) ITP patients at 75 mg/day and equivalent to the human clinical exposure in \n\nHCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC). Also there was no effect on embryofoetal development \n\nin rabbits at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested (0.3 to 0.5 times the human clinical \n\nexposure in ITP patients at 75 mg/day and HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC). However, at \n\na maternally toxic dose of 60 mg/kg/day (6 times the human clinical exposure in ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC) in \n\nrats, eltrombopag treatment was associated with embryo lethality (increased pre- and post-\n\nimplantation loss), reduced foetal body weight and gravid uterine weight in the female fertility study \n\nand a low incidence of cervical ribs and reduced foetal body weight in the embryofoetal development \n\nstudy. Eltrombopag should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the potential \n\nrisk to the foetus (see section 4.6). Eltrombopag did not affect male fertility in rats at doses up to \n\n40 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested (3 times the human clinical exposure in ITP patients at \n\n75 mg/day and 2 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at 100 mg/day, based on AUC). \n\nIn the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, there were no undesirable effects on pregnancy, \n\nparturition or lactation of F0 female rats at maternally non-toxic doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) and no \n\neffects on the growth, development, neurobehavioural or reproductive function of the offspring (F1). \n\nEltrombopag was detected in the plasma of all F1 rat pups for the entire 22 hour sampling period \n\nfollowing administration of medicinal product to the F0 dams, suggesting that rat pup exposure to \n\neltrombopag was likely via lactation. \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies with eltrombopag suggest a potential phototoxicity risk; however, in rodents there was \n\nno evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity (10 or 7 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 5 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC) or ocular phototoxicity (\uf0b34 times the human clinical exposure in adult or \n\npaediatric ITP patients at 75 mg/day and 3 times the human clinical exposure in HCV patients at \n\n100 mg/day, based on AUC). Furthermore, a clinical pharmacology study in 36 subjects showed no \n\nevidence that photosensitivity was increased following administration of eltrombopag 75 mg. This was \n\nmeasured by delayed phototoxic index. Nevertheless, a potential risk of photoallergy cannot be ruled \n\nout since no specific preclinical study could be performed. \n\n \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n\n \n\nAt non-tolerated doses in pre-weaning rats, ocular opacities were observed. At tolerated doses, no \n\nocular opacities were observed (see above subsection \u2018Safety pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicity\u2019). \n\nIn conclusion, taking into account the exposure margins based on AUC, a risk of eltrombopag-related \n\ncataracts in paediatric patients cannot be excluded. There are no findings in juvenile rats to suggest a \n\ngreater risk of toxicity with eltrombopag treatment in paediatric vs. adult ITP patients. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4 \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Revolade is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Revolade \n\n3. How to take Revolade \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Revolade \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Revolade is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRevolade contains eltrombopag, which belongs to a group of medicines called thrombopoietin \n\nreceptor agonists. It is used to help increase the number of platelets in your blood. Platelets are blood \n\ncells that help to reduce or prevent bleeding. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Revolade is used to treat a bleeding disorder called immune (primary) thrombocytopenia (ITP) \nin patients aged 1 year and above who have already taken other medicines (corticosteroids or \n\nimmunoglobulins), which have not worked. \n\n \n\nITP is caused by a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). People with ITP have an \n\nincreased risk of bleeding. Symptoms patients with ITP may notice include petechiae (pinpoint-\n\nsized flat round red spots under the skin), bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums and not being \n\nable to control bleeding if they are cut or injured. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Revolade can also be used to treat low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) in adults with \nhepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, if they have had problems with side effects while on \n\ninterferon treatment. Many people with hepatitis C have low platelet counts, not only as a result \n\nof the disease, but also due to some of the antiviral medicines that are used to treat it. Taking \n\nRevolade may make it easier for you to complete a full course of antiviral medicine \n\n(peginterferon and ribavirin). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Revolade may also be used to treat adult patients with low blood counts caused by severe \naplastic anaemia (SAA). SAA is a disease in which the bone marrow is damaged, causing a \n\ndeficiency of the red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets \n\n(thrombocytopenia). \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Revolade \n\n \n\nDo not take Revolade \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to eltrombopag or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6 under \u2018What Revolade contains\u2019). \n\n\uf0e8 Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Revolade: \n\n\uf0b7 if you have liver problems. People who have low platelet counts as well as advanced chronic \n(long-term) liver disease are more at risk of side effects, including life-threatening liver damage \n\nand blood clots. If your doctor considers that the benefits of taking Revolade outweigh the risks, \n\nyou will be closely monitored during treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 if you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or you know that blood clots are \ncommon in your family. \n\nYou may be at higher risk of blood clots: \n\n- as you get older \n- if you have had to stay in bed for a long time \n- if you have cancer \n- if you are taking the contraceptive birth control pill or hormone replacement therapy \n- if you have recently had surgery or received a physical injury \n- if you are very overweight (obese) \n- if you are a smoker \n- if you have advanced chronic liver disease \n\uf0e8 If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before starting treatment. You should not \n\ntake Revolade unless your doctor considers that the expected benefits outweigh the risk of \n\nblood clots. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have cataracts (the lens of the eye getting cloudy) \n\n\uf0b7 if you have another blood condition, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Your doctor \nwill carry out tests to check that you do not have this blood condition before you start Revolade. \n\nIf you have MDS and take Revolade, your MDS may get worse. \n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \n\nEye examinations \nYour doctor will recommend that you are checked for cataracts. If you do not have routine eye-tests \n\nyour doctor should arrange regular testing. You may also be checked for the occurrence of any \n\nbleeding in or around your retina (the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye). \n\n \n\nYou will need regular tests \n\nBefore you start taking Revolade, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check your blood cells, \n\nincluding platelets. These tests will be repeated at intervals while you are taking it. \n\n \n\nBlood tests for liver function \n\nRevolade can cause blood test results that may be signs of liver damage - an increase of some liver \n\nenzymes, especially bilirubin and alanine / aspartate transaminases. If you are taking interferon-based \n\ntreatments together with Revolade to treat low platelet count due to hepatitis C, some liver problems \n\ncan get worse. \n\n \n\nYou will have blood tests to check your liver function before you start taking Revolade and at \n\nintervals while you are taking it. You may need to stop taking Revolade if the amount of these \n\nsubstances increases too much, or if you get other signs of liver damage. \n\n\uf0e8 Read the information \u2018Liver problems\u2019 in section 4 of this leaflet. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n103 \n\nBlood tests for platelet count \n\nIf you stop taking Revolade, your blood platelet count is likely to become low again within several \n\ndays. The platelet count will be monitored, and your doctor will discuss appropriate precautions with \n\nyou. \n\n \n\nA very high blood platelet count may increase the risk of blood clotting. However blood clots can also \n\nform with normal or even low platelet counts. Your doctor will adjust your dose of Revolade to ensure \n\nthat your platelet count does not become too high. \n\n \n\n Get medical help immediately if you have any of these signs of a blood clot: \n\n\uf0b7 swelling, pain or tenderness in one leg \n\n\uf0b7 sudden shortness of breath especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing \n\n\uf0b7 abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools \n \n\nTests to check your bone marrow \n\nIn people who have problems with their bone marrow, medicines like Revolade could make the \n\nproblems worse. Signs of bone marrow changes may show up as abnormal results in your blood tests. \n\nYour doctor may also carry out tests to directly check your bone marrow during treatment with \n\nRevolade. \n\n \n\nChecks for digestive bleeding \n\nIf you are taking interferon-based treatments together with Revolade you will be monitored for any \n\nsigns of bleeding in your stomach or intestine after you stop taking Revolade. \n\n \n\nHeart monitoring \n\nYour doctor may consider it necessary to monitor your heart during treatment with Revolade and carry \n\nout an electrocardiogram (ECG) test. \n\n \n\nOlder people (65 years and above) \n\nThere are limited data on the use of Revolade in patients aged 65 years and older. Care should be \n\ntaken when using Revolade if you are aged 65 years or above. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRevolade is not recommended for children aged under 1 year who have ITP. It is also not \n\nrecommended for people under 18 years with low platelet counts due to hepatitis C or severe aplastic \n\nanaemia. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Revolade \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without prescription and vitamins. \n\n \n\nSome everyday medicines interact with Revolade \u2013 including prescription and non-prescription \n\nmedicines and minerals. These include: \n\n\uf0b7 antacid medicines to treat indigestion, heartburn or stomach ulcers (see also \u2018When to take it\u2019 \nin section 3) \n\n\uf0b7 medicines called statins, to lower cholesterol \n\n\uf0b7 some medicines to treat HIV infection, such as lopinavir and/or ritonavir \n\n\uf0b7 ciclosporin used in the context of transplantations or immune diseases \n\n\uf0b7 minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc which may be found \nin vitamin and mineral supplements (see also \u2018When to take it\u2019 in section 3) \n\n\uf0b7 medicines such as methotrexate and topotecan, to treat cancer \n\uf0e8 Talk to your doctor if you take any of these. Some of them are not to be taken with Revolade, \n\nor the dose may need adjusting, or you may need to alter the timing of when you take them. \n\nYour doctor will review the medicines you are taking, and suggest suitable replacements if \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n\nIf you are also taking medicines to prevent blood clots there is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor \n\nwill discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine you may need to take a lower dose or \n\nto stop taking them while you are taking Revolade. \n\n \n\nRevolade with food and drink \n\nDo not take Revolade with dairy foods or drinks as the calcium in dairy products affects the absorption \n\nof the medicine. For more information, see \u2018When to take it\u2019 in section 3. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nDon\u2019t use Revolade if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The effect of \n\nRevolade during pregnancy is not known. \n\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a \nbaby. \n\n\uf0b7 Use a reliable method of contraception while you\u2019re taking Revolade, to prevent pregnancy \n\n\uf0b7 If you do become pregnant during treatment with Revolade, tell your doctor. \n \n\nDon\u2019t breast-feed while you are taking Revolade. It is not known whether Revolade passes into \n\nbreast-milk. \n\n\uf0e8 If you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed, tell your doctor. \n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nRevolade can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. \n\n\uf0e8 Don\u2019t drive or use machines unless you are sure you\u2019re not affected. \n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Revolade \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. Do not change the dose or schedule for taking Revolade unless your doctor or \n\npharmacist advises you to. While you are taking Revolade, you will be under the care of a doctor with \n\nspecialist experience in treating your condition. \n\n \n\nHow much to take \n\nFor ITP \n\nAdults and children (6 to 17 years) \u2013 the usual starting dose for ITP is one 50 mg tablet of Revolade \n\na day. If you are of Asian origin (Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai or Korean) you may need to \n\nstart at a lower dose of 25 mg. \n\n \n\nChildren (1 to 5 years) \u2014 the usual starting dose for ITP is one 25 mg tablet of Revolade a day. \n\n \n\nFor hepatitis C \n\nAdults - the usual starting dose for hepatitis C is one 25 mg tablet of Revolade a day. If you are of \n\nAsian origin (Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai or Korean) you will start on the same 25 mg dose. \n\n \n\nFor SAA \n\nAdults - the usual starting dose for SAA is one 50 mg tablet of Revolade a day. If you are of Asian \n\norigin (Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai or Korean) you may need to start at a lower dose of \n\n25 mg. \n\n \n\nRevolade may take 1 to 2 weeks to work. Based on your response to Revolade your doctor may \n\nrecommend that your daily dose is changed. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n105 \n\nHow to take the tablets \nSwallow the tablet whole, with some water. \n\n \n\nWhen to take it \n\n \n\nMake sure that \u2013 \n\n\uf0b7 in the 4 hours before you take Revolade \n\n\uf0b7 and the 2 hours after you take Revolade \n\n \n\nyou don\u2019t consume any of the following: \n\n\uf0b7 dairy foods such as cheese, butter, yoghurt or ice cream \n\n\uf0b7 milk or milk shakes, drinks containing milk, yoghurt or cream \n\n\uf0b7 antacids, a type of medicine for indigestion and heartburn \n\n\uf0b7 some mineral and vitamin supplements including iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, \nselenium and zinc \n\n \n\nIf you do, the medicine will not be properly absorbed into your body. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFor more advice about suitable foods and drinks, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Revolade than you should \n\nContact a doctor or pharmacist immediately.

Do not take more than one dose of Revolade in one day. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Revolade \n\nDon\u2019t stop taking Revolade without talking to your doctor. If your doctor advises you to stop \n\ntreatment, your platelet count will then be checked each week for four weeks. See also \u2018Bleeding or \n\nbruising after you stop treatment\u2019 in section 4. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nNO dairy products, antacids \nor mineral supplements \n\nTake Revolade \n\nFor 4 hours \nbefore you  \ntake \n\nRevolade... \n\n    ...  and for \n\n2 hours after \n\n\n\n106 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSymptoms needing attention: see a doctor \n\nPeople taking Revolade for either ITP or low blood platelet counts due to hepatitis C could develop \n\nsigns of potentially serious side effects. It is important to tell a doctor if you develop these \n\nsymptoms. \n\n \n\nHigher risk of blood clots \n\nCertain people may have a higher risk of blood clots, and medicines like Revolade could make this \n\nproblem worse. The sudden blocking of a blood vessel by a blood clot is an uncommon side effect and \n\nmay affect up to 1 in 100 people. \n\n \n\nGet medical help immediately if you develop signs and symptoms of a blood clot, such as: \n\n\uf0b7 swelling, pain, heat, redness, or tenderness in one leg \n\n\uf0b7 sudden shortness of breath, especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing \n\n\uf0b7 abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools. \n \n\nLiver problems \n\nRevolade can cause changes that show up in blood tests, and may be signs of liver damage. Liver \n\nproblems (increased enzymes showing up in blood tests) are common and may affect up to 1 in \n\n10 people. Other liver problems (bile not flowing properly) are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in \n\n100 people. \n\n \n\nIf you have either of these signs of liver problems: \n\n\uf0b7 yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n\n\uf0b7 unusually dark-coloured urine \n\uf0e8 tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\nBleeding or bruising after you stop treatment \n\nWithin two weeks of stopping Revolade, your blood platelet count will usually drop back down to \n\nwhat it was before starting Revolade. The lower platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding or \n\nbruising. Your doctor will check your platelet count for at least 4 weeks after you stop taking \n\nRevolade. \n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding or bruising after stopping Revolade. \n \n\nSome people have bleeding in the digestive system after they stop taking peginterferon, ribavirin, and \n\nRevolade. Symptoms include: \n\n\uf0b7 black tarry stools (discoloured bowel movements are a uncommon side effect that may affect up \nto 1 in 100 people) \n\n\uf0b7 blood in your stools \n\n\uf0b7 vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee grounds \n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. \n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported to be associated with

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n Instructions for use \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Revolade is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRevolade contains eltrombopag, which belongs to a group of medicines called thrombopoietin \n\nreceptor agonists. It is used to help increase the number of platelets in your blood. Platelets are blood \n\ncells that help to reduce or prevent bleeding. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Revolade is used to treat a bleeding disorder called immune (primary) thrombocytopenia (ITP) \nin patients aged 1 year and above who have already taken other medicines (corticosteroids or \n\nimmunoglobulins), which have not worked. \n\n \n\nITP is caused by a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). People with ITP have an \n\nincreased risk of bleeding. Symptoms patients with ITP may notice include petechiae (pinpoint-\n\nsized flat round red spots under the skin), bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums and not being \n\nable to control bleeding if they are cut or injured. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Revolade can also be used to treat low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) in adults with \nhepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, if they have had problems with side effects while on \n\ninterferon treatment. Many people with hepatitis C have low platelet counts, not only as a result \n\nof the disease, but also due to some of the antiviral medicines that are used to treat it. Taking \n\nRevolade may make it easier for you to complete a full course of antiviral medicine \n\n(peginterferon and ribavirin). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Revolade may also be used to treat adult patients with low blood counts caused by severe \naplastic anaemia (SAA). SAA is a disease in which the bone marrow is damaged, causing a \n\ndeficiency of the red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets \n\n(thrombocytopenia). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Revolade \n\n \n\nDo not take Revolade \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to eltrombopag or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6 under \u2018What Revolade contains\u2019). \n\n\uf0e8 Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Revolade: \n\n\uf0b7 if you have liver problems. People who have low platelet counts as well as advanced chronic \n(long-term) liver disease are more at risk of side effects, including life-threatening liver damage \n\nand blood clots. If your doctor considers that the benefits of taking Revolade outweigh the risks, \n\nyou will be closely monitored during treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 if you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or you know that blood clots are \ncommon in your family. \n\nYou may be at higher risk of blood clots: \n\n- as you get older \n- if you have had to stay in bed for a long time \n- if you have cancer \n- if you are taking the contraceptive birth control pill or hormone replacement therapy \n- if you have recently had surgery or received a physical injury \n- if you are very overweight (obese) \n- if you are a smoker \n- if you have advanced chronic liver disease \n\uf0e8 If any of these apply to you tell your doctor before starting treatment. You should not \n\ntake Revolade unless your doctor considers that the expected benefits outweigh the risk of \n\nblood clots. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have cataracts (the lens of the eye getting cloudy) \n\n\uf0b7 if you have another blood condition, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Your doctor \nwill carry out tests to check that you do not have this blood condition before you start Revolade. \n\nIf you have MDS and take Revolade, your MDS may get worse. \n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \n\nEye examinations \nYour doctor will recommend that you are checked for cataracts. If you do not have routine eye-tests, \n\nyour doctor should arrange regular testing. You may also be checked for the occurrence of any \n\nbleeding in or around your retina (the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye). \n\n \n\nYou will need regular tests \n\nBefore you start taking Revolade, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check your blood cells, \n\nincluding platelets. These tests will be repeated at intervals while you are taking it. \n\n \n\nBlood tests for liver function \n\nRevolade can cause blood test results that may be signs of liver damage - an increase of some liver \n\nenzymes, especially bilirubin and alanine / aspartate transaminases. If you are taking interferon-based \n\ntreatments together with Revolade to treat low platelet count due to hepatitis C, some liver problems \n\ncan get worse. \n\n \n\nYou will have blood tests to check your liver function before you start taking Revolade and at \n\nintervals while you are taking it. You may need to stop taking Revolade if the amount of these \n\nsubstances increases too much, or if you get other signs of liver damage. \n\n\uf0e8 Read the information \u2018Liver problems\u2019 in section 4 of this leaflet. \n  \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\nBlood tests for platelet count \n\nIf you stop taking Revolade, your blood platelet count is likely to become low again within several \n\ndays. The platelet count will be monitored, and your doctor will discuss appropriate precautions with \n\nyou. \n\n \n\nA very high blood platelet count may increase the risk of blood clotting. However blood clots can also \n\nform with normal or even low platelet counts. Your doctor will adjust your dose of Revolade to ensure \n\nthat your platelet count does not become too high. \n\n \n\n Get medical help immediately if you have any of these signs of a blood clot: \n\n\uf0b7 swelling, pain or tenderness in one leg \n\n\uf0b7 sudden shortness of breath especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing \n\n\uf0b7 abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools \n \n\nTests to check your bone marrow \n\nIn people who have problems with their bone marrow, medicines like Revolade could make the \n\nproblems worse. Signs of bone marrow changes may show up as abnormal results in your blood tests. \n\nYour doctor may also carry out tests to directly check your bone marrow during treatment with \n\nRevolade. \n\n \n\nChecks for digestive bleeding \n\nIf you are taking interferon-based treatments together with Revolade you will be monitored for any \n\nsigns of bleeding in your stomach or intestine after you stop taking Revolade. \n\n \n\nHeart monitoring \n\nYour doctor may consider it necessary to monitor your heart during treatment with Revolade and carry \n\nout an electrocardiogram (ECG) test. \n\n \n\nOlder people (65 years and above) \n\nThere are limited data on the use of Revolade in patients aged 65 years and older. Care should be \n\ntaken when using Revolade if you are aged 65 years or above. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRevolade is not recommended for children aged under 1 year who have ITP. It is also not \n\nrecommended for people under 18 years with low platelet counts due to hepatitis C or severe aplastic \n\nanaemia. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Revolade \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without prescription and vitamins. \n\n \n\nSome everyday medicines interact with Revolade \u2013 including prescription and non-prescription \n\nmedicines and minerals. These include: \n\n\uf0b7 antacid medicines to treat indigestion, heartburn or stomach ulcers (see also \u2018When to take it\u2019 \nin section 3) \n\n\uf0b7 medicines called statins, to lower cholesterol \n\n\uf0b7 some medicines to treat HIV infection, such as lopinavir and/or ritonavir \n\n\uf0b7 ciclosporin used in the context of transplantations or immune diseases \n\uf0b7 minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc which may be found \n\nin vitamin and mineral supplements (see also \u2018When to take it\u2019 in section 3) \n\n\uf0b7 medicines such as methotrexate and topotecan, to treat cancer \n\uf0e8 Talk to your doctor if you take any of these. Some of them are not to be taken with Revolade, \n\nor the dose may need adjusting, or you may need to alter the timing of when you take them. \n\nYour doctor will review the medicines you are taking, and suggest suitable replacements if \n\nnecessary. \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\nIf you are also taking medicines to prevent blood clots, there is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor \n\nwill discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine you may need to take a lower dose or \n\nto stop taking them while you are taking Revolade. \n\n \n\nRevolade with food and drink \n\nDo not take Revolade with dairy foods or drinks as the calcium in dairy products affects the absorption \n\nof the medicine. For more information, see \u2018When to take it\u2019 in section 3. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nDon\u2019t use Revolade if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The effect of \n\nRevolade during pregnancy is not known. \n\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a \nbaby. \n\n\uf0b7 Use a reliable method of contraception while you\u2019re taking Revolade, to prevent pregnancy \n\n\uf0b7 If you do become pregnant during treatment with Revolade, tell your doctor. \n \n\nDon\u2019t breast-feed while you are taking Revolade. It is not known whether Revolade passes into \n\nbreast-milk. \n\n\uf0e8 If you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed, tell your doctor. \n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nRevolade can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. \n\n\uf0e8 Don\u2019t drive or use machines unless you are sure you\u2019re not affected. \n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Revolade \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. Do not change the dose or schedule for taking Revolade unless your doctor or \n\npharmacist advises you to. While you are taking Revolade, you will be under the care of a doctor with \n\nspecialist experience in treating your condition. \n\n \n\nHow much to take \n\nFor ITP \n\nAdults and children (6 to 17 years) - the usual starting dose for ITP is two 25 mg sachets of \n\nRevolade a day. If you are of Asian origin (Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai or Korean) you may \n\nneed to start at a lower dose of 25 mg. \n\n \n\nChildren (1 to 5 years) \u2014 the usual starting dose for ITP is one 25 mg sachet of Revolade a day. \n\n \n\nFor hepatitis C \n\nAdults - the usual starting dose for hepatitis C is one 25 mg sachet of Revolade a day. If you are of \n\nAsian origin (Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai or Korean) you will start on the same 25 mg dose. \n\n \n\nFor SAA \n\nAdults - the usual starting dose for SAA is two 25 mg sachets of Revolade a day. If you are of Asian \n\norigin (Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai or Korean) you may need to start at a lower dose of \n\n25 mg. \n \n\nRevolade may take 1 to 2 weeks to work. Based on your response to Revolade your doctor may \n\nrecommend that your daily dose is changed. \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n\nHow to give a dose of medicine \n\nThe powder for oral suspension is in sachets, the contents of which will need to mixed before you can \n\ntake the medicine.

A new single-use oral dosing syringe should be used to prepare each dose of \n\nRevolade for oral suspension. \n\n \n\nWhen to take it \n\n \n\nMake sure \u2013 \n\n\uf0b7 in the 4 hours before you take Revolade \n\n\uf0b7 and the 2 hours after you take Revolade \n\n \n\nyou don\u2019t consume any of the following: \n\n\uf0b7 dairy foods such as cheese, butter, yoghurt or ice cream \n\n\uf0b7 milk or milk shakes, drinks containing milk, yoghurt or cream \n\n\uf0b7 antacids, a type of medicine for indigestion and heartburn \n\n\uf0b7 some mineral and vitamin supplements including iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, \n\nselenium and zinc \n\n \n\nIf you do, the medicine will not be properly absorbed into your body. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFor more advice about suitable foods and drinks, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Revolade than you should \n\nContact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. If possible show them the pack, or this leaflet. \n\nYou will be monitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and given appropriate treatment \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Revolade \n\nTake your next dose at the usual time. Do not take more than one dose of Revolade in one day. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Revolade \n\nDon\u2019t stop taking Revolade without talking to your doctor. If your doctor advises you to stop \n\ntreatment, your platelet count will then be checked each week for four weeks. See also \u2018Bleeding or \n\nbruising after you stop treatment\u2019 in section 4. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\nNO dairy products, antacids \n\nor mineral supplements \n\nTake Revolade \n\nFor 4 hours \nbefore you  \ntake \n\nRevolade... \n\n    ...  and for \n\n2 hours after \n\n\n\n120 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSymptoms needing attention: see a doctor \n\nPeople taking Revolade for either ITP or low blood platelet counts due to hepatitis C could develop \n\nsigns of potentially serious side effects. It is important to tell a doctor if you develop these \n\nsymptoms. \n\n \n\nHigher risk of blood clots \n\nCertain people may have a higher risk of blood clots, and medicines like Revolade could make this \n\nproblem worse. The sudden blocking of a blood vessel by a blood clot is an uncommon side effect and \n\nmay affect up to 1 in 100 people. \n\n \n\n Get medical help immediately if you develop signs and symptoms of a blood clot, such as: \n\n\uf0b7 swelling, pain, heat, redness or tenderness in one leg \n\n\uf0b7 sudden shortness of breath, especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing \n\n\uf0b7 abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools. \n \n\nLiver problems \n\nRevolade can cause changes that show up in blood tests, and may be signs of liver damage. Liver \n\nproblems (increased enzymes showing up in blood tests) are common and may affect up to 1 in \n\n10 people. Other liver problems (bile not flowing properly) are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in \n\n100 people. \n\n \n\nIf you have either of these signs of liver problems: \n\n\uf0b7 yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n\n\uf0b7 unusually dark-coloured urine \n\uf0e8 tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\nBleeding or bruising after you stop treatment \n\nWithin two weeks of stopping Revolade, your blood platelet count will usually drop back down to \n\nwhat it was before starting Revolade. The lower platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding or \n\nbruising. Your doctor will check your platelet count for at least 4 weeks after you stop taking \n\nRevolade. \n\n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding or bruising after stopping Revolade. \n \n\nSome people have bleeding in the digestive system after they stop taking peginterferon, ribavirin, and \n\nRevolade. Symptoms include: \n\n- black tarry stools (discoloured bowel movements are a uncommon side effect that may affect up \nto 1 in 100 people) \n\n- blood in your stools \n- vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee grounds \n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. \n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported to be associated with treatment with

If you get a skin reaction, or if you have any questions, contact the doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you spill any powder or liquid, clean it up with a damp cloth (see step 14 of the instructions). \n\n\uf0b7 Take care that the child does not play with the bottle, cap, lid or syringes \u2014 there is a risk of \nchoking if the child puts them in their mouth. \n\n \n\nWhat you need \n\nEach Revolade powder for oral suspension kit contains: \n\n \n\n30 sachets of powder \n \n\n1 reusable mixing bottle with lid and cap (note \u2014 \n\nthe mixing bottle may become stained) \n\n \n30 single-use oral dosing syringes  \n\n \n \n\nTo prepare and give a dose of Revolade, you need: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 The correct number of sachets your doctor has prescribed (supplied in the kit) \n\n\uf0b7 1 reusable mixing bottle with lid and cap (supplied in the kit) \n\n\uf0b7 1 single-use oral dosing syringe (supplied in the kit) \n\n\uf0b7 1 clean glass or cup filled with drinking water (not supplied) \n\n\uf0b7 scissors to cut sachet (not supplied) \n \n\nCap \n\nLid \n\nPlunger Syringe tip \n\n\n\n130 \n\nMake sure that the bottle, cap and lid are dry before you use them. \n\nTo prepare the dose \n\n1.  Make sure the lid is not on the mixing bottle. \n\n2.  Fill the syringe with 20 ml drinking water from the glass or cup. \n\nA new single-use oral dosing syringe should be used to prepare each \n\ndose of Revolade for oral suspension. \n\n\uf0b7 Start with the plunger pushed all the way into the syringe. \n\n\uf0b7 Put the tip of the syringe all the way into the water \n\n\uf0b7 Pull back on the plunger to the 20 ml mark on the syringe. \n\n \n3.  Empty water into open mixing bottle \n\n\uf0b7 Slowly pushing the plunger all the way into the syringe. \n\n \n4.  Take only the prescribed number of sachets for one dose out of the kit. \n\n\uf0b7 25 mg dose \u2014 1 sachet \n\n\uf0b7 50 mg dose \u2014 2 sachets \n\n\uf0b7 75 mg dose \u2014 3 sachets \n\n \n\n5.  Add the powder from the prescribed number of sachets to \nthe bottle. \n\n\uf0b7 Tap the top of each sachet to make sure the contents fall to \nthe bottom \n\n\uf0b7 Cut off the top of each sachet with scissors \n\n\uf0b7 Empty all contents of each sachet into the mixing bottle \n\n\uf0b7 Make sure not to spill the powder outside the mixing bottle. \n\n \n6.  Screw the lid onto the mixing bottle. Make sure the cap is firmly pushed onto the lid, so it is \n\nclosed. \n \n\n7.  Gently and slowly shake the mixing bottle backwards and \n\nforwards for at least 20 seconds to mix the water with the powder. \n\n\uf0b7 Don\u2019t shake the bottle hard \u2014 that could make the medicine \nfoam. \n\n \nTo give a dose to a child \n\n8.  Make sure the plunger is pushed all the way into the syringe. \n\n\uf0b7 Pull cap off the lid of the mixing bottle \n\n\uf0b7 Insert the syringe tip into the hole in the bottle lid. \n\n9.  Fill the syringe with the medicine. \n\n\uf0b7 Turn the mixing bottle upside-down together with the \nsyringe. \n\n\uf0b7 Pull back the plunger until all the medicine is in the syringe. \n\n\uf0b7 The medicine is a dark brown liquid. \n\n\uf0b7 Remove the syringe from the bottle. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n131 \n\n10.  Give the medicine to the child. Do this straight away when \n\nyou have mixed the dose. \n\n\uf0b7 Place the tip of the syringe into the inside of the child\u2019s \ncheek. \n\n\uf0b7 Slowly push the plunger all the way down so the medicine \ngoes into the child\u2019s mouth. \n\nMake sure the child has time to swallow. \n\n \n\n \n\nIMPORTANT: \nYou have now given the child nearly all of their dose of medicine. But there will still be some left in \n\nthe bottle, even though you may not be able to see it. \n\nNow you need to complete steps 11 to 13 to make sure the child receives all of the medicine. \n\n11.  Again fill the syringe, this time with 10 ml of drinking water. \n\n\uf0b7 Start with the plunger pushed all the way down into the \nsyringe. \n\n\uf0b7 Put the tip of the syringe all the way into the water \n\n\uf0b7 Pull back on the plunger to the 10 ml mark on the syringe. \n\n \n12.  Empty the water into the mixing bottle. \n\n\uf0b7 Insert the tip of the syringe into the hole in the lid of the \nmixing bottle. \n\n\uf0b7 Slowly push the plunger all the way into the syringe. \n\n\uf0b7 Push the cap firmly back on to the lid of the mixing bottle. \n\n \n13.  Repeat steps 7 to 10 \u2013 gently shake the bottle to mix the rest of the medicine, then give all the \n\nrest of the liquid to the child. \n\nTo clean up \n\n14.  If you have spilt any powder or mixed medicine, clean it up with a damp disposable cloth. \n\nYou may choose to wear disposable gloves so your skin doesn\u2019t get stained. \n\n\uf0b7 Dispose of the cloth and gloves used to clean up the spillage in your household waste. \n\n15.  Clean the mixing equipment. \n\n\uf0b7 Throw away the used oral dosing syringe. A new oral dosing syringe should be used to \nprepare each dose of Revolade for oral suspension. \n\n\uf0b7 Rinse the mixing bottle and lid under running water. (The mixing bottle may become stained \nfrom the medicine. This is normal.) \n\n\uf0b7 Let all the equipment dry in the air. \n\n\uf0b7 Wash your hands with soap and water. \n\nAfter you have used all 30 sachets in the kit, dispose of the bottle. Always start with a complete \n\nnew kit for each 30 sachets. \n\n \n\nKeep Revolade powder for oral suspension, including the dosing kit, and all medicines out of the \n\nreach of children. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

receptor agonists. it is used to help increase the number of platelets in your blood. platelets are blood cells that help to reduce or prevent bleeding. revolade is used to treat a bleeding disorder called immune (primary) thrombocytopenia (itp) in patients aged 1 year and above who have already taken other medicines (corticosteroids or immunoglobulins), which have not worked. itp is caused by a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). people with itp have an increased risk of bleeding. symptoms patients with itp may notice include petechiae (pinpoint- sized flat round red spots under the skin), bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums and not being able to control bleeding if they are cut or injured. revolade can also be used to treat low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) in adults with hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections, if they have had problems with side effects while on interferon treatment. many people with hepatitis c have low platelet counts, not only as a result of the disease, but also due to some of the antiviral medicines that are used to treat it. taking revolade may make it easier for you to complete a full course of antiviral medicine (peginterferon and ribavirin). revolade may also be used to treat adult patients with low blood counts caused by severe aplastic anaemia (saa). saa is a disease in which the bone marrow is damaged, causing a deficiency of the red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (thrombocytopenia).", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "revolade", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset":

(listed in section 6 under 'what revolade contains'). check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking revolade: if you have liver problems. people who have low platelet counts as well as advanced chronic (long-term) liver disease are more at risk of side effects, including life-threatening liver damage and blood clots. if your doctor considers that the benefits of taking revolade outweigh the risks, you will be closely monitored during treatment. if you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or you know that blood clots are common in your family. you may be at higher risk of blood clots: - as you get older - if you have had to stay in bed for a long time - if you have cancer - if you are taking the contraceptive birth control pill or hormone replacement therapy - if you have recently had surgery or received a physical injury - if you are very overweight (obese) - if you are a smoker - if you have advanced chronic liver disease if any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before starting treatment. you should not take revolade unless your doctor considers that the expected benefits outweigh the risk of blood clots. if you have cataracts (the lens of the eye getting cloudy) if you have another blood condition, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (mds). your doctor will carry out tests to check that you do not have this blood condition before you start revolade. if you have mds and take revolade, your mds may get worse. tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. eye examinations your doctor will recommend that you are checked for cataracts. if you do not have routine eye-tests your doctor should arrange regular testing. you may also be checked for the occurrence of any bleeding in or around your retina (the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye). you will need regular tests before you start taking revolade, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check your blood cells, including platelets. these tests will be repeated at intervals while you are taking it. blood tests for liver function revolade can cause blood test results that may be signs of liver damage - an increase of some liver enzymes, especially bilirubin and alanine / aspartate transaminases. if you are taking interferon-based treatments together with revolade to treat low platelet count due to hepatitis c, some liver problems can get worse. you will have blood tests to check your liver function before you start taking revolade and at intervals while you are taking it. you may need to stop taking revolade if the amount of these substances increases too much, or if you get other signs of liver damage. read the information 'liver problems' in section 4 of this leaflet. blood tests for platelet count if you stop taking revolade, your blood platelet count is likely to become low again within several days. the platelet count will be monitored, and your doctor will discuss appropriate precautions with you. a very high blood platelet count may increase the risk of blood clotting. however blood clots can also form with normal or even low platelet counts. your doctor will adjust your dose of revolade to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. get medical help immediately if you have any of these signs of a blood clot: swelling, pain or tenderness in one leg sudden shortness of breath especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools tests to check your bone marrow in people who have problems with their bone marrow, medicines like revolade could make the problems worse. signs of bone marrow changes may show up as abnormal results in your blood tests. your doctor may also carry out tests to directly check your bone marrow during treatment with revolade. checks for digestive bleeding if you are taking interferon-based treatments together with revolade you will be monitored for any signs of bleeding in your stomach or intestine after you stop taking revolade. heart monitoring your doctor may consider it necessary to monitor your heart during treatment with revolade and carry out an electrocardiogram (ecg) test. older people (65 years and above) there are limited data on the use of revolade in patients aged 65 years and older. care should be taken when using revolade if you are aged 65 years or above. children and adolescents revolade is not recommended for children aged under 1 year who have itp. it is also not recommended for people under 18 years with low platelet counts due to hepatitis c or severe aplastic anaemia. other medicines and revolade tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this includes medicines obtained without prescription and vitamins. some everyday medicines interact with revolade including prescription and non-prescription medicines and minerals. these include: antacid medicines to treat indigestion, heartburn or stomach ulcers (see also 'when to take it' in section 3) medicines called statins, to lower cholesterol some medicines to treat hiv infection, such as lopinavir and/or ritonavir ciclosporin used in the context of transplantations or immune diseases minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc which may be found in vitamin and mineral supplements (see also 'when to take it' in section 3) medicines such as methotrexate and topotecan, to treat cancer talk to your doctor if you take any of these. some of them are not to be taken with revolade, or the dose may need adjusting, or you may need to alter the timing of when you take them. your doctor will review the medicines you are taking, and suggest suitable replacements if necessary. if you are also taking medicines to prevent blood clots there is a greater risk of bleeding. your doctor will discuss this with you. if you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine you may need to take a lower dose or to stop taking them while you are taking revolade. revolade with food and drink do not take revolade with dairy foods or drinks as the calcium in dairy products affects the absorption of the medicine. for more information, see 'when to take it' in section 3. pregnancy and breast-feeding don't use revolade if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. the effect of revolade during pregnancy is not known. tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. use a reliable method of contraception while you're taking revolade, to prevent pregnancy if you do become pregnant during treatment with revolade, tell your doctor. don't breast-feed while you are taking revolade. it is not known whether revolade passes into breast-milk. if you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed, tell your doctor. driving and using machines revolade can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. don't drive or use machines unless you are sure you're not affected.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "revolade",
