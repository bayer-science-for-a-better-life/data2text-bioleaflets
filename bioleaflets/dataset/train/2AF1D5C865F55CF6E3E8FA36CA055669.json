PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral Solution \nPale yellow clear liquid that may have a pink tint\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRotaTeq is indicated for the active immunisation of infants from the age of 6 weeks to 32 weeks for \nprevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nRotaTeq is to be used on the basis of official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nFrom birth to 6 weeks\nRotaTeq is not indicated in this subset of paediatric population. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of RotaTeq in individuals from birth to 6 weeks of age have not been \nestablished.\n\nFrom 6 weeks to 32 weeks\nThe vaccination course consists of three doses.\nThe first dose may be administered from the age of 6 weeks and no later than the age of 12 weeks.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nRotaTeq may be given to infants who were born prematurely provided that the period of gestation was \nat least 25 weeks. These infants should receive the first dose of RotaTeq at least six weeks after birth \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nThere should be intervals of at least 4 weeks between doses.\n\nIt is preferable that the vaccination course of three doses should be completed by the age of \n20-22 weeks. If necessary, the third (last) dose may be given up to the age of 32 weeks (see section \n5.1).\n\nAs no data exist regarding the interchangeability of RotaTeq with another rotavirus vaccine, it is \nrecommended that infants who receive RotaTeq for the first immunisation against rotavirus should \nreceive this same vaccine for the subsequent doses.\n\nIf it is observed or strongly suspected that an incomplete dose has been swallowed (e.g., infant spits or \nregurgitates the vaccine), a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit, \nhowever, this has not been studied in clinical trials. If the problem recurs, additional replacement \ndoses should not be given.\n\nNo further doses are recommended after completion of the 3-dose vaccination course (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.1 regarding available information on persistence of protection).\n\nFrom 33 weeks to 18 years\nRotaTeq is not indicated in this subset of paediatric population. \n\nMethod of administration\nRotaTeq is for oral administration only.\n\nRotaTeq SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE INJECTED.\n\nRotaTeq may be given without regard to food, liquid, or breast milk.\n\nSee section 6.6 for administration instructions.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity after previous administration of rotavirus vaccines.\n\nPrevious history of intussusception.\n\nSubjects with congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that could predispose to \nintussusception.\n\nInfants who have known or suspected immunodeficiency (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nAdministration of RotaTeq should be postponed in infants suffering from acute severe febrile illness. \nThe presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication for immunisation.\n\nThe administration of RotaTeq should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute diarrhoea or \nvomiting.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAs with all vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of an \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).\n\nNo safety or efficacy data are available from clinical trials regarding administration of RotaTeq to \nimmunocompromised infants, infants infected with HIV or infants who have received a blood \ntransfusion or immunoglobulins within 42 days of dosing. Asymptomatic HIV infection is not \nexpected to affect the safety or efficacy of RotaTeq. However, in the absence of sufficient data, \nadministration of RotaTeq to asymptomatic HIV-infected infants is not recommended.\n\nCases of gastroenteritis associated with vaccine virus have been reported post marketing in infants \nwith severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID, see section 4.3).\n\nIn trials, RotaTeq was shed in the stools of 8.9 % of vaccine recipients almost exclusively in the week \nafter dose 1 and in only one vaccine recipient (0.3 %) after dose 3. Peak excretion occurred within \n7 days of dosing. Transmission of vaccine virus strains to non-vaccinated contacts has been observed \npost-marketing. RotaTeq should be administered with caution to individuals with close contacts who \nare immunodeficient (e.g., individuals with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised \nor individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy). Also, those caring for recent vaccinees should \nobserve careful hygiene especially when handling excreta.\n\nIn a clinical study, RotaTeq was administered to approximately 1,000 infants who were born at a \ngestational age of 25 to 36 weeks. The first dose was administered from 6 weeks after birth. The safety \nand efficacy of RotaTeq were comparable between this subset of infants and infants born at term. \nHowever, 19 of the approximately 1,000 infants were born at a gestational age of 25 to 28 weeks, 55 \nwere born at a gestational age of 29 to 31 weeks and the remainder was born at a gestational age of \nbetween 32 and 36 weeks. See sections 4.2 and 5.1.\n\nIntussusception\n\nAs a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of \nintussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or \nhigh fever) since data from observational studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, mostly \nwithin 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised to \npromptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n\nFor subjects with a predisposition for intussusception, see section 4.3.\n\nSafety or efficacy data are not available for infants with active gastrointestinal illnesses (including \nchronic diarrhoea) or growth retardation. Administration of RotaTeq may be considered with caution\nin such infants when, in the opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk.\n\nThe level of protection provided by RotaTeq is based on the completion of all 3 doses. As with any \nvaccine, vaccination with RotaTeq may not result in complete protection in all recipients. RotaTeq \ndoes not protect against gastroenteritis due to other pathogens than rotavirus.\n\nClinical trials of efficacy against rotavirus gastroenteritis were performed in Europe, the United States, \nLatin America, and Asia. During these trials, the most common circulating rotavirus genotype was \nG1P[8], while rotavirus genotypes G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8] were identified less often. \nThe extent of protection that RotaTeq might provide against other rotavirus types and in other \npopulations is unknown.\n\nNo clinical data are available on the use of RotaTeq for post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \u226428 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit \nof vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.\n\nRotaTeq SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE INJECTED.\n\nSucrose\nRotaTeq contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this vaccine. See \nsection 2.\n\nSodium\nThis vaccine contains 37.6 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 1.88% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. See section 2.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCo-administration of RotaTeq with vaccines containing one or more of the following antigens at \napproximately 2, 4 and 6 months of age demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety \nprofiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected:\n\n- Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP)\n- Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib)\n- Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV)\n- Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)\n- Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)\n\nCo-administration of RotaTeq with DTaP-IPV-HBV-Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) at approximately 2, \n3, and 4 months of age demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the \nco-administered vaccines were unaffected compared to separate administrations.\n\nCo-administration of RotaTeq with a group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenCC, the vaccine \nstudied was a tetanus toxoid conjugate) at 3 and 5 months of age (and mostly at the same time as \nDTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine), followed by a third dose of RotaTeq at approximately 6 months of age, \ndemonstrated that the immune responses to RotaTeq and MenCC were unaffected. Co-administration \nresulted in an acceptable safety profile.\n\nConcomitant administration of RotaTeq and oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) did not affect the \nimmune response to the poliovirus antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV slightly \nreduced the immune response to rotavirus vaccine, there is currently no evidence that clinical \nprotection against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis would be affected. The immune response to RotaTeq \nwas unaffected when OPV was administered two weeks after RotaTeq.\n\nTherefore, RotaTeq can be given concomitantly with monovalent or combination infant vaccines \ncontaining one or more of the following antigens: DTaP, Hib, IPV or OPV, HBV, PCV and MenCC.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nRotaTeq is intended for use in infants only. Thus human data on use during pregnancy or lactation are \nnot available and animal fertility or reproduction studies have not been performed.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\na. Summary of the safety profile\nIn a subset of infants from 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials (n=6,130 recipients of RotaTeq and \n5,560 placebo recipients), RotaTeq was evaluated for all adverse events within 42 days of vaccination \nwith or without concomitant use of other paediatric vaccines. Overall, 47 % of infants given RotaTeq \nexperienced an adverse reaction compared with 45.8 % of infants given placebo. The most commonly \nreported adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with vaccine than with placebo were pyrexia \n(20.9 %), diarrhoea (17.6 %) and vomiting (10.1 %).\n\nSerious adverse reactions were assessed in all participants (36,150 recipients of RotaTeq and \n35,536 placebo recipients) of 3 clinical trials for up to 42 days after each dose. The overall frequency \nof these serious adverse reactions was 0.1 % among recipients of RotaTeq and 0.2 % among placebo \nrecipients.\n\nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions more common in the vaccine group in clinical trials are listed below per system \norgan class and frequency. Based on pooled data from 3 clinical trials in which 6,130 infants received \nRotaTeq and 5,560 received placebo, the adverse reactions listed occurred with excess incidences in \nRotaTeq recipients compared to placebo recipients of between 0.2 % and 2.5 %. \n\nFrequencies are reported as:\nVery common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100, <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000, <1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000, \n<1/1,000), Very rare (< 1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nAdverse reactions following administration of RotaTeq in clinical trials and adverse events reported \npost-marketing (in italics)\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction/Event\n\nInfections and infestations Common Upper respiratory tract infection\n\nUncommon Nasopharyngitis, otitis media\n\nImmune system disorders Not known Anaphylactic reaction\u2021\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nRare Bronchospasm\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Diarrhoea, vomiting\n\nUncommon Haematochezia\u2020, Abdominal pain upper\n\nVery Rare Intussusception \u03b1 *\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Rash\n\nRare Urticaria\u2020\n\nNot known Angioedema\u2021\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery common Pyrexia\n\nNot known Irritability\u2021\n\n\u2020 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance. The \nfrequency category was estimated based on relevant clinical trials.\n\n\u03b1 The frequency category was estimated based on observational study data.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\n* See section 4.4.\n\u2021 Post-marketing adverse events (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nc. Description of selected adverse reactions\nKawasaki disease was reported in 5 of 36,150 vaccine recipients (<0.1 %) and 1 of 35,536 placebo \nrecipients (<0.1 %) with a relative risk (RR) of 4.9 [95 % CI, 0.6 \u2013 239.1] (not statistically significant). \nNo increased risk of Kawasaki disease was observed among infants receiving RotaTeq in a large post-\nmarketing observational safety surveillance study (see section 5.1).\n\nIntussusception\nData from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines \ncarry an increased risk of intussusception, with up to 6 additional cases per 100,000 infants within \n7 days of vaccination. There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose. \nThe background incidence of intussusception in infants less than one year of age in these countries \nranged from 25 to 101 per 100,000 infants per year. It remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines \naffect the overall incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of follow up (see section 4.4).\n\nd. Other special populations\nApnoea in very premature infants (born \u226428 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4)\n\nGastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in infants with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency \nDisease (SCID) has been reported post-marketing.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of RotaTeq.\n\nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to that observed with \nrecommended doses of RotaTeq.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine ATC code: J07BH02.\n\nEfficacy\n\nIn clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastroenteritis due to rotavirus of genotypes \nG1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8].\n\nThe protective efficacy of RotaTeq was evaluated in two ways in the placebo-controlled Rotavirus \nEfficacy and Safety Trial (REST):\n\n1. In 5,673 vaccinated infants (2,834 in the vaccine group) protective efficacy was measured as a \nreduction in the incidence of rotavirus (RV) gastroenteritis caused by vaccine G genotypes \n(G1-G4) that occurred at least 14 days after the third dose of vaccine through the first full \nrotavirus season after vaccination. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\n2. In 68,038 vaccinated infants (34,035 in the vaccine group) protective efficacy was measured as \na reduction in the rate of hospitalisations and emergency department visits for RV \ngastroenteritis from 14 days after the third dose. \n\nThe results of these analyses are presented in the following tables.\n\nReduction in incidence of RV gastroenteritis through one full season post-vaccination\n(RotaTeq n=2,834) (% [95 % CI])\n\nEfficacy against any severity by rotavirus genotype\nSevere* \ndisease\n\n(G1-G4)\n\nAny \nseverity\n(G1-G4)\n\nG1 G2 G3 G4 G9\n\n98.0 %\n[88.3, 100.0]\u2020\n\n74.0 %\n[66.8, \n79.9]\u2020\n\n74.9 %\n[67.3, 80.9]\u2020\n\n63.4 %\n[2.6, 88.2]\u2020\n\n82.7 %\n[<0, 99.6]\n\n48.1 %\n[<0, 91.6]\n\n65.4 %\n[<0, 99.3]\n\n* Severe defined as a score >16/24 using a validated clinical scoring system based on the intensity and \nduration of symptoms (fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and behavioural changes)\n\u2020 Statistically significant\n\nReduction in hospitalisations and emergency department visits for RV gastroenteritis for up to 2 years \npost-vaccination\n\n(RotaTeq n=34,035) (% [95 % CI])\nG1-G4 G1 G2 G3 G4 G9\n94.5 %\n\n[91.2, 96.6]\u2020\n95.1 %\n[91.6, \n97.1]\u2020\n\n87.6 %\n[\uf03c0, 98.5]\n\n93.4 %\n[49.4, 99.1]\u2020\n\n89.1 %\n[52.0, \n97.5]\u2020\n\n100 % \n[69.6, 100]\u2020\n\n\u2020 Statistically significant\n\nThe reduction in incidence of RV gastroenteritis caused by genotypes G1-G4 during the second \nrotavirus season after vaccination was 88.0 % [95 % CI 49.4, 98.7] for severe disease and 62.6 % \n[95 % CI 44.3, 75.4] for disease of any severity.\n\nEfficacy against genotypes G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8] rotavirus was based on fewer cases \nthan for G1. The efficacy observed against G2P[4] most likely resulted from the G2 component of the \nvaccine.\n\nIn a combined post-hoc analysis of REST and another phase III study, the vaccine efficacy against \nG1-, G2-, G3- and G4-serotype RVG cases (any severity) was 61.5 % [95 % CI: 14.2; 84.2] among \ninfants who were >26 to \u226432 weeks of age at dose 3.\n\nThere was an extension of REST conducted in Finland only. This Finnish Extension Study (FES) \nincluded a subset of 20,736 subjects that had been enrolled previously in REST. The infants were \nfollowed for up to 3 years post-vaccination in the FES.\n\nIn REST there were 403 healthcare encounters (20 in the vaccine group and 383 in the placebo group) \nassociated with G1-G4 and G9 RV gastroenteritis in the per protocol population. The additional data \nfrom the FES increased the number by 136 encounters in total, including 9 in the vaccine group and \n127 in the placebo group. Overall, 31 % and 25 % of the encounters in the respective groups occurred \nduring the FES.\n\nBased upon combined data from REST and the FES, the reduction up to 3 years post-vaccination in \nthe rate of hospitalisations and emergency department visits for RV gastroenteritis was 94.4 % \n(95 % CI: 91.6, 96.2) for genotypes G1-G4, 95.5 % (95 % CI: 92.8, 97.2) for genotype G1, 81.9 % \n(95 % CI: 16.1, 98.0) for genotype G2, 89.0 % (95 % CI: 53.3, 98.7) for genotype G3, 83.4 % \n(95 % CI: 51.2, 95.8) for genotype G4, and 94.2 % (95 % CI: 62.2, 99.9) for genotype G9. During \nyear 3, there were no health care contacts for RV gastroenteritis in the vaccine group (n=3,112) and \none (non-typeable) in the placebo group (n=3,126).\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nA complete 3-dose vaccination series of RotaTeq should be administered (see section 4.2) to provide \nthe level and duration of protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis that was observed in the clinical \nstudies. However, post hoc analyses indicated that RotaTeq achieved some reduction in the numbers \nof cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis of sufficient severity to require hospitalisation or an emergency \ndepartment visit before completion of all three doses (i.e. from approximately 14 days after \nadministration of the first dose onwards).\n\nEfficacy in premature infants\nIn REST, RotaTeq was administered to approximately 1,000 infants who were born at a gestational \nage of 25 to 36 weeks. The efficacy of RotaTeq was comparable between this subset of infants and \ninfants born at term.\n\nPost-marketing observational safety surveillance study \nIn a large prospective post-marketing observational study in the US, the risk of Kawasaki disease was\nanalysed among 85,150 infants receiving one or more doses of RotaTeq (17,433 person-years of \nfollow-up).\n\nDuring the 0-30 day follow-up period after vaccination, there were no statistically significant \ndifference in the rate of Kawasaki disease compared with the expected background rate. In addition, \nthere was no statistically significant increased risk of this adverse event during the 0-30 day follow-up \nperiod compared with a concurrent control group of infants who received DTaP, but not RotaTeq \n(n=62,617, 12,339 person-years of follow-up). One chart-confirmed case was recorded among infants \nvaccinated with RotaTeq compared with one chart-confirmed case among concurrent DTaP controls \n(relative risk = 0.7, 95 % CI: 0.01-55.56). In the general safety analyses, no specific safety concerns \nwere identified.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nEffectiveness study data\nPost marketing studies demonstrating effectiveness to prevent RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) \n\nStudy design\n(Region)\n\nStudy population Endpoints Effectiveness\n% [95%CI]\n\nRV seasons\n\nClaims \ndatabase \nanalysis (US)\n\n33,140 vaccinated \n26,167 unvaccinated\nAged \u22657 months\nReceived 3 doses\n\nHospitalization and Emergency \nDepartment (ED) visits due to \nRVGE\n\nOutpatients due to RVGE\n\nHospitalization and ED visits \ndue to all cause gastroenteritis\n\n100% [87,100]\n\n96% [76,100]\n\n59% [47,68]\n\n2007-2008\n\nCohort study\n(France)\n\n1,895 vaccinated with 3 \ndoses\n2,102 unvaccinated\nAged <2 years\n\nHospitalization due to RVGE 98% [83,100] 2007-2008\n2008-2009\n\nCase-control \nstudy (US)\n\n402 cases\n2,559 controls*\nAged <8 years\nReceived 3 doses\n\nHospitalization and ED visits \ndue to RVGE\n\nStrain-specific\n- G1P[8]\n- G2P[4]\n- G3P[8]\n- G12P[8]\nAge-specific\n- 1st year of life\n- 2nd year of life\n- 3rd year of life\n- 4th year of life\n- 5th year of life\n- 6th-7th year of life\n\n80% [74,84]\n\n89% [55,97]\n87% [65,95]\n80% [64,89]\n78% [71,84]\n\n91% [78,96]\n82% [69,89]\n88% [78,93]\n76% [51,88]\n60% [16,81]\n69% [43,84]\n\n2011-2012\n2012-2013\n\n*RV-negative acute gastroenteritis controls\n\nImmunogenicity\nThe immunological mechanism by which RotaTeq protects against rotavirus gastroenteritis is not \ncompletely understood. No immunological correlate of protection has currently been identified for \nrotavirus vaccines. In phase III studies between 92.5 % and 100 % of recipients of RotaTeq achieved a \nsignificant rise in serum anti-rotavirus IgA after a three-dose regimen. The vaccine induces an immune \nresponse (i.e., appearance of serum neutralising antibody) to the five human-rotavirus proteins \nexpressed on the reassortants (G1, G2, G3, G4 and P[8]).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nA single and repeated dose oral toxicity study in mice suggests no special hazard to humans. The dose \nadministered to mice was approximately 2.79 x 108 infectious units per kg (about 14-fold the projected \ninfant dose).\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user\nRotaTeq oral solution\nRotavirus vaccine (live)\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child is vaccinated because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What RotaTeq is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before your child receives RotaTeq\n3. How to use RotaTeq \n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store RotaTeq\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What RotaTeq is and what it is used for\n\nRotaTeq is an oral vaccine that helps protect infants and young children against gastroenteritis \n(diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus infection and may be given to infants from the age of \n6 weeks to 32 weeks (see section 3). The vaccine contains five types of live rotavirus strains. When an \ninfant is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defences) will make antibodies \nagainst the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies help protect against \ngastroenteritis caused by these types of rotavirus.\n\n2. What you need to know before your child receives RotaTeq\n\nDo not use RotaTeq if\n\n- your child is allergic to any of the components of this vaccine (see section 6 Contents of the \npack and other information).\n\n- your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of RotaTeq or other rotavirus \nvaccine.\n\n- your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of \nbowel becomes enfolded within another segment).\n\n- your child was born with a malformation of the gastrointestinal system that might predispose for \nintussusception.\n\n- your child has any disease which reduces his/her resistance to infection.\n- your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the \n\nvaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to\nyour doctor first.\n\n- your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until\nrecovery.\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using RotaTeq if your child:\n- has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within the last 6 weeks.\n- has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, e.g., a \n\nperson with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system.\n- has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system.\n- has not been gaining weight and growing as expected.\n\nAfter your child has received RotaTeq, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your \n\nchild experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or \n\nhigh fever (see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d).\n\nAs always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies.  \n\nAs with other vaccines, RotaTeq may not completely protect all children who are vaccinated even \nafter all three doses have been given.  \n\nIf your child has already been infected with rotavirus but is not yet ill when vaccinated, RotaTeq may \nnot be able to prevent the illness. \n\nRotaTeq does not protect against diarrhoea and vomiting due to causes other than rotavirus. \n\nOther medicines and RotaTeq\n\nRotaTeq may be given at the same time as your child receives other normally recommended \nvaccinations, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, \ninactivated or oral poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, pneumococcal conjugate and meningococcus group C \nconjugate vaccines.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (or other vaccines).\n\nRotaTeq with food and drink\n\nThere are no restrictions on taking food or liquid, including breast milk, either before or after \nvaccination with RotaTeq. \n\nRotaTeq contains sucrose\n\nIf you have been told that your child has an intolerance to some sugars, inform your doctor/health care \nprofessional before the vaccine is administered.  \n\nRotaTeq contains sodium\n\nThis vaccine contains 37.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is \nequivalent to 1.88% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.\n\n3. How to use RotaTeq\n\nRotaTeq IS FOR ORAL USE ONLY.\n\nA doctor or nurse will administer the recommended doses of RotaTeq to your child. The vaccine will \nbe given by gently squeezing the tube and delivering the vaccine into your child\u2019s mouth. \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nThe vaccine can be given without regard to food, liquid, or breast milk. \nIn case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be \ngiven at the same vaccination visit. \n\nUnder no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by injection. \n\nThe first dose (2 ml) of RotaTeq may be given from the age of 6 weeks and should be given before \n12 weeks of age (about 3 months). RotaTeq may be given to infants who were born early provided that \nthe pregnancy had lasted at least 25 weeks. These infants should receive the first dose of vaccine \nbetween 6 and 12 weeks after birth.\n\nYour child will receive 3 doses of RotaTeq given at least four weeks apart. It is important that your \nchild receives all 3 doses of the vaccine for protection against rotavirus. It is preferred that all three \ndoses should be given by the age of 20-22 weeks and at latest all three doses should be given by the \nage of 32 weeks.\n\nWhen RotaTeq is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives \nRotaTeq (and not another rotavirus vaccine) to complete the vaccination course. \n\nIf you forget an appointment for RotaTeq\n\nIt is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor/health care professional regarding your \nchild\u2019s return visits for the follow-up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your \ndoctor/health care professional at the scheduled time, ask him or her for advice. \n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem.  \n\nContact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences one of the following \nsymptoms:\n\n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data), which may be severe\n(anaphylaxis), and may include: allergic swelling that may affect the face, lips, tongue or throat.\n\n\uf0b7 Bronchospasm (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1000 infants). This may present as wheezing, \ncoughing or difficulty breathing.\n\n\uf0b7 Severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever. \nThese could be symptoms of a very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 infants), but serious, side \neffect called intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of bowel becomes \nenfolded within another segment).\n\nThe following other side effects reported with the use of RotaTeq were:\n\n\uf0b7 Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 infants): fever, diarrhoea, vomiting\n\n\uf0b7 Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 infants): infections of the upper respiratory system\n\n\uf0b7 Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 infants): stomach pains (see also above for signs of a \nvery rare side effect of intussusception), runny nose and sore throat, ear infection, rash, blood \nin stool\n\n\uf0b7 Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 infants): hives\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\n\uf0b7 Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): irritability\n\nIn babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between \nbreaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination.\n\nAsk your doctor/health care professional if you want more information about side effects for RotaTeq.  \n\nReporting of side effects\nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store RotaTeq\n\nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the label after EXP. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore and transport refrigerated (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C). Keep the dosing tube in the outer carton in order to \nprotect from light.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment.  \n\n6.

malformation of the gastrointestinal system that might predispose for intussusception. - your child has any disease which reduces his/her resistance to infection. - your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. it might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until recovery. a minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. - your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. it might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until recovery. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using rotateq if your child: - has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within the last 6 weeks. - has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. - has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. - has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. after your child has received rotateq, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever (see also section 4 \"possible side effects\"). as always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. as with other vaccines, rotateq may not completely protect all children who are vaccinated even after all three doses have been given. if your child has already been infected with rotavirus but is not yet ill when vaccinated, rotateq may not be able to prevent the illness. rotateq does not protect against diarrhoea and vomiting due to causes other than rotavirus. other medicines and rotateq rotateq may be given at the same time as your child receives other normally recommended vaccinations, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated or oral poliomyelitis, hepatitis b, pneumococcal conjugate and meningococcus group c conjugate vaccines. tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines (or other vaccines). rotateq with food and drink there are no restrictions on taking food or liquid, including breast milk, either before or after vaccination with rotateq. rotateq contains sucrose if you have been told that your child has an intolerance to some sugars, inform your doctor/health care professional before the vaccine is administered. rotateq contains sodium this vaccine contains 37.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. this is equivalent to 1.88% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "rotateq", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

affect the face, lips, tongue or throat. bronchospasm (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1000 infants). this may present as wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing. severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever. these could be symptoms of a very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 infants), but serious, side effect called intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). the following other side effects reported with the use of rotateq were: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 infants): fever, diarrhoea, vomiting common (may affect up to 1 in 10 infants): infections of the upper respiratory system uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 infants): stomach pains (see also above
