CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSubstitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and \npsychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. \nTreatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be \ntreated for addiction. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opioid \ndependence/addiction. \n \nZubsolv is not interchangeable with other buprenorphine products, as different buprenorphine \nproducts have different bioavailability. Therefore the dose in mg can differ between products. Once \nthe appropriate dose has been identified for a patient with a specific buprenorphine product, that \nproduct should not be exchanged with another product. \n \nIf a patient is changed between buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone containing \nproducts, dose adjustments may be necessary due to the potential differences in bioavailability \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nUse of multiples of the three lower dose presentations of Zubsolv to substitute for any of the three \nhigher dose presentations (in for example cases where the higher dose presentations are \ntemporarily not available) is not recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nPrecautions to be taken before induction \n \nPrior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. \nlong- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To \navoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone only should be undertaken \nwhen objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated e.g. by a score indicating \nmild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS). \n• For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of \n\nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 6 \nhours after the patient last used opioids. \n\n• For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone should be reduced to a maximum of \n\n\n\n4  \n\n30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half-life of methadone \nshould be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less \nthan 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms \nof withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone. \n\n \nBaseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status are recommended prior to \ncommencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products \n(see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at risk of accelerated liver injury. Regular \nmonitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4) \n \nPosology \n \nInitiation therapy \nDuring the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper \nsublingual placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective \ndose titration according to clinical effect. \n \nInduction \nThe recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is Zubsolv \n1.4 mg / 0.36 mg or 2.9 mg / 0.71 mg a day. An additional Zubsolv 1.4 mg / 0.36 mg or \n2.9 mg / 0.71 mg may be administered on day one depending on the individual patient’s requirement. \n \nDosage adjustment and maintenance therapy \nFollowing treatment induction on day one, the patient should be stabilised to a maintenance dose \nduring the next few days by progressively adjusting the dose according to the clinical effect on the \nindividual patient. Patients should be monitored during dose titration. For steps of 1.4-5.7 mg \nbuprenorphine this titration is guided by reassessment of the clinical and psychological status of the \npatient, and should not exceed a maximum single daily dose of 17.2 mg buprenorphine (e.g. given as \n11.4 + 5.7 mg, 2 x 8.6 mg or 3 x 5.7 mg). \n \nThe 0.7mg / 0.18mg strength is intended to be used to fine tune the dose for patients especially \nduring tapering of treatment or in case of tolerability issues during titration. \n \nPhysicians are encouraged to prescribe a single tablet once daily regimen where possible to minimise \nrisk of diversion. \n \nLess than daily dosing \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of dosing may be decreased to \ndosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. In some patients, after a \nsatisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, the frequency of dosing may be decreased to 3 times a \nweek (for example on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The dose on Monday and Wednesday should \nbe twice the individually titrated daily dose, and the dose on Friday should be three times the \nindividually titrated daily dose, with no dose on the intervening days.) However, the dose given on \nany one day should not exceed 17.2 mg buprenorphine. Patients requiring a titrated daily dose > 5.7 \nmg buprenorphine /day may not find this regimen adequate. \n \nMedical withdrawal \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dosage may be reduced \ngradually to a lower maintenance dose; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. \nThe availability of six different tablet strengths supports individual dose titration and tapering. \nPatients should be monitored following medical withdrawal because of the potential for relapse. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n\n\n\n5  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not \nbeen established. No recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBaseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to \ncommencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, receiving concomitant medicinal \nproducts (see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at risk of accelerated liver injury. \nRegular monitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nBoth active substances of Zubsolv, buprenorphine and naloxone, are extensively metabolized in the \nliver, and the plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms \nof opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of naloxone and/or \nbuprenorphine. \n \nAs buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment, \nlower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are \nrecommended (see section 5.2). Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nModification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. \nCaution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nPhysicians must warn patients that the sublingual route is the only effective and safe route of \nadministration for this medicinal product (see section 4.4). The tablet is to be placed under the tongue \nuntil completely dissolved. Patients should not swallow or consume food or drink until the tablet is \ncompletely dissolved. \n \nZubsolv disintegrates usually within 40 seconds, however it may take 5 to 10 minutes for the patient \nto feel complete tablet disappearance from the mouth. \n \nIf more than one tablet is required, they may be taken all at the same time or in two divided portions; \nthe second portion is to be taken directly after the first portion has dissolved. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \nSevere respiratory insufficiency. \nSevere hepatic impairment. \nAcute alcoholism or delirium tremens. \nConcomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of \nalcohol or opioid dependence. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMisuse, abuse and diversion \n \nBuprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some \n\n\n\n6  \n\nrisks to opioid misusers and abusers include overdose, spread of blood borne viral or localised and \nsystemic infections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone \nother than the intended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using \nbuprenorphine as the primary drug of abuse, and may occur if the medicine is distributed for illicit \nuse directly by the intended patient or if the medicinal product is not safeguarded against theft. \n \nSub-optimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt medicine misuse by the patient, \nleading to overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is under-dosed with buprenorphine/naloxone \nmay continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, \nalcohol or other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. \n \nTo minimize the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, physicians should take appropriate precautions \nwhen prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as to avoid prescribing multiple refills early in \ntreatment, and to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate to the \npatient's needs. \n \nCombining buprenorphine with naloxone in Zubsolv is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the \nbuprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Zubsolv is expected to be less likely than \nbuprenorphine alone since the naloxone in Zubsolv can precipitate withdrawal in individuals \ndependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists. \n \nRespiratory depression \n \nA number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when \nbuprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when \nbuprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information. Deaths have also been reported in \nassociation with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol \nor other opioids. \n \nIf buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are not tolerant to \nthe effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. \n \nThis product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency (e.g. \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, \nhypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to \npotential shortness of breath)). \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and \nnon-dependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store \nthe blister safely, to never open the blister in advance, to keep them out of the sight and reach of \nchildren and other household members, and not to take this medicine in front of children. An \nemergency unit should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of \ningestion. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \n \nConcomitant administration of Zubsolv and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, \nselective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors \n(SNRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening \ncondition (see section 4.5). \nIf concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, careful observation \nof the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. \n \nSymptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, \nneuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. \n \n\n\n\n7  \n\nIf serotonin syndrome is suspected, a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be \nconsidered depending on the severity of the symptoms. \n \nCNS depression \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or \ncentral nervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics) (see section 4.5). \n \nDependence \n \nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the μ (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces \ndependence of the opioid type. Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated \nthat buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist e.g. morphine. \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in withdrawal syndrome \nwith delayed onset. \n \nHepatitis and hepatic events \n \nCases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials \nand in post marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient \nasymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal \nsyndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing \nmitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic \nmedicines) and ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These \nunderlying factors must be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and \nduring treatment. \nWhen a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and etiological evaluation is required. \nDepending upon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent \nwithdrawal symptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic \nfunction should be monitored closely. \n \nPrecipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome \n \nWhen initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial \nagonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, \nparticularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, \nor if administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. To avoid precipitating \nwithdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken when objective signs of \nwithdrawal are evident (see section 4.2). Patients should be closely monitored during the switching \nperiod from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone since withdrawal symptoms \nhave been reported. \n \nWithdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing.  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study. Since both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively \nmetabolized in liver, plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in \npatients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment after single-dose administration. Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by \nincreased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine. Zubsolv sublingual tablets should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). In patients with \nsevere hepatic insufficiency the use of buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n8  \n\n \nRenal impairment \n \nRenal elimination may be prolonged since 30 % of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal \nroute. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is \nrecommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nUse in adolescents (Age 15 - <18 years) \n \nDue to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15 - <18 years), patients in this age group should be more \nclosely monitored during treatment. \n \nChanging between buprenorphine containing products \n \nThe dose in mg can differ between buprenorphine products and products are not directly \ninterchangeable. Therefore, patients should be monitored when changing between different \nbuprenorphine containing products as differences in bioavailability (see section 5.2) may be \nnoticeable in some individual cases. Dosage adjustments may therefore be necessary. \n \nCYP 3A inhibitors \n \nMedicines that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of \nbuprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already \ntreated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully \nsince a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nGeneral warnings relevant to the administration of opioids \n \nOpioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. \n \nOpioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be \nused with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, other circumstances where \ncerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or history of seizure. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral \nstenosis. \n \nOpioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as \na symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical \ncourse of concomitant disease. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal \ncortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). \n \nOpioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in \npatients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. \n \nOpioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of \nopioid effects, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nZubsolv must not be taken together with: \n\n\n\n9  \n\n• naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects \nof buprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is \ncontraindicated due to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden \nonset of prolonged and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3) \n\n \nZubsolv should not be taken together with: \n• alcoholic drinks or medicines containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative effect \n\nof buprenorphine (see section 4.7) \n \nZubsolv should be used cautiously when co-administered with: \n• benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of \n\ncentral origin. Therefore, dosages must be limited and this combination must be avoided in \ncases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely \ndangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this product, and \nshould also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as \ndirected by their physician (see section 4.4) \n\n• serotonergic medicinal products, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake \ninhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic \nantidepressants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, \nis increased (see section 4.4) \n\n• other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, \nanalgesics and antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, \nbarbiturates, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related \nsubstances: these combinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced \nlevel of alertness can make driving and using machines hazardous \n\n• Full opioid agonist: adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full \nopioid agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the potential to \noverdose with a full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine \npartial agonist effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining \n\n• CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent \ninhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of \nbuprenorphine (approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of \nnorbuprenorphine Patients receiving Zubsolv should be closely monitored, and may require \ndose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like \nritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir, azole antifungals such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or \nmacrolide antibiotics) \n\n• CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may \ndecrease buprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal \ntreatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients \nreceiving buprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. \nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of \nbuprenorphine or the CYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly \n\n• the concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce exaggeration \nof the effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \nTowards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn \ninfant even after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during \n\n\n\n10  \n\nthe last three months of pregnancy may cause withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, \nneonatal tremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed \nfor several hours to several days after birth. \n \nDue to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered \nat the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in \nneonates. \n \nFurthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the \nphysician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIn rats buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. Buprenorphine and its metabolites are \nexcreted in human milk. It is unknown whether naloxone/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nTherefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Zubsolv. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 \ntimes the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 17.2 mg buprenorphine, based on \nAUC) (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \nwhen administered to opioid dependent patients. This product may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or \nimpaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken together with \nalcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case \nbuprenorphine/naloxone may affect their ability to engage in such activities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical \ntrials were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and \nelevated liver function tests were considered serious. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 summarises adverse reactions reported from pivotal clinical trials in which, 342 of 472 \npatients (72.5 %) reported adverse reactions and adverse reactions reported during post-marketing \nsurveillance. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \nVery common (≥1/10), Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), Rare \n(≥/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very rare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nTable 1: Treatment related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing \n\nsurveillance of buprenorphine/naloxone \n\n\n\n11  \n\n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Influenza \nInfection \nPharyngitis \nRhinitis \n\nUrinary tract \ninfection Vaginal \ninfection \n\n \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia \nLeukocytosis \nLeukopenia \nLymphadenopathy \nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic \nshock \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Decreased appetite \nHyperglycaemia \nHyperlipidaemia \nHypoglycaemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Anxiety \nDepression \nLibido decreased \nNervousness \nThinking \nabnormal \n\nAbnormal dreams \nAgitation \nApathy \nDepersonalisation \nDrug dependence \nEuphoric mood \nHostility \n\nHallucination \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Migraine  \nDizziness \nHypertonia \nParaesthesia \nSomnolence \n\nAmnesia \nHyperkinesia \nSeizure \nSpeech disorder  \nTremor \n\nHepatic \nencephalopathy \nSyncope \n\nEye disorders  Amblyopia \nLacrimal \ndisorder \n\nConjunctivitis Miosis  \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n   Vertigo \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Angina Pectoris \nBradycardia  \nMyocardial infarction \nPalpitations  \nTachycardia \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension \nVasodilatation \n\nHypotension Orthostatic \nhypotension \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough Asthma Dyspnoea \nYawning \n\nBronchospasm \nRespiratory \ndepression \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation \nNausea \n\nAbdominal Pain \nDiarrhoea \nDyspepsia \nFlatulence \nVomiting \n\nMouth ulceration  \nTongue  \ndiscolouration \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n   Hepatitis  \nHepatitis acute \nJaundice  \nHepatic \n\n\n\n12  \n\nnecrosis \nHepatorenal \nsyndrome \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nHyperhidrosis Pruritus Rash \nUrticaria \n\nAcne Alopecia \nDermatitis exfoliative  \nDry skin  \nSkin mass \n\nAngioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Back Pain \nArthralgia  \nMuscle spasms \nMyalgia \n\nArthritis  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n Urine \nabnormality \n\nAlbuminuria  \nDysuria  \nHaematuria \nNephrolithiasis  \nUrinary retention \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n Erectile \ndysfunction \n\nAmenorrhoea  \nEjaculation  \ndisorder  \nMenorrhagia \nMetrorrhagia \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nDrug \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \n\nAsthenia  \nChest  \nPain  \nChills  \nPyrexia  \nMalaise  \nPain  \nOedema \nperipheral \n\nHypothermia Drug \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal \n\nInvestigations  Liver function \ntest abnormal \nWeight \ndecreased \n\nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n\nTransaminases \nincreased \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n Injury Heat stroke  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse reactions are attributed to the act of misuse rather \nthan the medicinal product. These include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), \npotentially serious acute hepatitis, and other acute infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn patients with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can produce a drug \nwithdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n\n\n13  \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nRespiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom \nrequiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. \nSigns of overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting \nand/or speech disorders. \n \nManagement \n \nGeneral supportive measures should be initiated, including close monitoring of respiratory and \ncardiac status of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression and standard intensive \ncare measures should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be \nassured. The patient should be transferred to an environment where full resuscitation facilities are \navailable. \n \nIf the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. \n \nUse of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in \nreversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid \nagents. \nIf naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration \nwhen determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an \noverdose. Naloxone can be eliminated more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of \npreviously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. \nIf infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required. Initial naloxone doses \nmay range up to 2 mg and be repeated every 2-3 minutes. Ongoing intravenous infusion rates should \nbe titrated to patient response. The diagnosis of opioid-related toxicity should be reconsidered if \nthere is still failure to respond after a total of 10 mg of naloxone has been administered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC \ncode: N07BC51. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBuprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the μ and κ (kappa) opioid \nreceptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible \nproperties with the μ-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of \naddicted patients for drugs. \n \nOpioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-\ndependent patients. \n \nNaloxone is an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual \ndoses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological \neffect because of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered \nintravenously to opioid-dependent patients the presence of naloxone in Zubsolv produces marked \nopioid antagonist effects, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. \n \nClinical efficacy \n\n\n\n14  \n\n \nEfficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical \ntrial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, \nbuprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48 week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this \ntrial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg \nper day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomised to either active treatment, \ndosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine \non Day 2. On Day 3, those randomised to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the \ncombination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and \nefficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison \nwas to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against \nplacebo. The percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was \nstatistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine \nversus placebo (p < 0.0001). \n \nIn a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution \nto a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomised to receive the ethanolic sublingual \nsolution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day \nof buprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low \nenough to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week \nmaintenance phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance \ndose by Day 3; active control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and \nthe percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was \nmore effective than the low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in \nreducing their use of opioids while in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day \nwas similar to that of the moderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nZubsolv disintegrates usually within 40 seconds, however it may take 5 to 10 minutes for the patient \nto feel complete tablet disappearance from the mouth. \n \nZubsolv sublingual tablets have a higher bioavailability than conventional sublingual tablets. \nTherefore the dose in mg can differ between products. Zubsolv is not interchangeable with other \nbuprenorphine products. \n \nIn comparative bioavailability studies Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg displayed equivalent buprenorphine \nexposure to 16/4mg (2 x 8/2mg) buprenorphine/naloxone administered as conventional sublingual \ntablets however Zubsolv 2 x 1.4/0.36 mg displayed 20% lower buprenorphine exposure to 2 x \n2/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone administered as conventional sublingual tablets. Naloxone \nexposure was not higher from Zubsolv at any of the tested dose levels. \n \nBuprenorphine \n \nAbsorption \nBuprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and \nglucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral \nroute is therefore inappropriate. \n \nThere are small deviations in buprenorphine dose proportionality exposure parameters as well as \ndeviations from strict compositional proportionality for the three lower strengths (2.9/0.71, 1.4/0.36, \nand 0.7/0.18 mg) compared to the three higher dose presentations. Therefore, multiples of the three \nlower dose presentations of Zubsolv should not be used to substitute for any of the three higher dose \nZubsolv presentations. \n \nPeak plasma concentrations are achieved approximately 90 minutes after sublingual administration. \n\n\n\n15  \n\nPlasma levels of buprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. Both \nCmax and AUC of buprenorphine increased with the increase in dose, although the increase was less \nthan dose-proportional. \n \nDistribution \nThe absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 \nto 5 hours). \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nBuprenorphine is metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation and glucuroconjugation of the parent molecule \nand the dealkylated metabolite. Clinical data confirm that CYP3A4 is responsible for the \nN-dealkylation of buprenorphine. N-dealkylbuprenorphine is a μ-opioid agonist with weak intrinsic \nactivity. \n \nElimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and has a mean half-life from plasma of 32 \nhours. \n \nBuprenorphine is eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated metabolites \n(70 %), the rest being eliminated in the urine. \n \nNaloxone \n \nAbsorption and distribution \nFollowing intravenous administration, naloxone is rapidly distributed (distribution half-life ~ 4 \nminutes). Following oral administration, naloxone is barely detectable in plasma; following \nsublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, plasma naloxone concentrations are low and \ndecline rapidly. \n \nBiotransformation \nNaloxone is metabolised in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted in the urine. \nNaloxone has a mean half-life from plasma of 1.2 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30 %) in the overall clearance of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is \nrecommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study. \n \nTable 2 summarizes the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure after single-dose \nadministration of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet was determined in healthy subjects, and \nin subjects with hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n16  \n\nTable 2: Effect of hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetic parameters of buprenorphine \nand naloxone following administration (change relative to healthy subjects) \n\nPK Parameter Mild hepatic \nImpairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class A) \n(n=9) \n\nModerate Hepatic \nImpairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class B) \n(n=8) \n\nSevere Hepatic \nImpairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C) \n(n=8) \n\nBuprenorphine \n\nCmax 1.2-fold increase 1.1-fold increase 1.7-fold increase \n\nAUClast Similar to control 1.6-fold increase 2.8-fold increase \n\n \n\nNaloxone \n\nCmax Similar to control 2.7-fold increase 11.3-fold increase \n\nAUClast 0.2-fold decrease 3.2-fold increase 14.0-fold increase \n\n \nOverall, buprenorphine plasma exposure increased approximately 3-fold in patients with severely \nimpaired hepatic function, while naloxone plasma exposure increased 14-fold with severely impaired \nhepatic function. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe combination of buprenorphine and naloxone has been investigated in acute and repeated dose \n(up to 90 days in rats) toxicity studies in animals. No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been \nobserved. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonistic \nand/or antagonistic substances. \n \nThe combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not \nmutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), and was not clastogenic in an in vitro \ncytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. \n \nReproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that \nembryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose \nstudied represented exposure multiples of 1x for buprenorphine and 5 x for naloxone at the maximum \nhuman therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m² basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in \nrabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or \nrabbits. A peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, \nmaternal oral administration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in \ndifficult parturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal \nmortality and a slight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting \nreflex and startle response) in neonatal rats. \n \nDietary administration of buprenorphine in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater produced a \nreduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 100 ppm \n(estimated exposure approximately 2.4 x for buprenorphine at a human dose of 17.2 mg \nbuprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection \nin rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. \n \nA carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7, 30 and \n120 mg/kg/day, with estimated dose multiples of 3 to75 times, based on a Zubsolv equivalent human \ndaily sublingual dose of 11.4 mg of buprenorphine calculated on a mg/m² basis. Statistically \nsignificant increases in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were \n\n\n\n17  \n\nobserved in all dosage groups. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Zubsolv \n3. How to take Zubsolv \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zubsolv \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zubsolv is and what it is used for \n \nZubsolv contains the active substances buprenorphine and naloxone. Zubsolv is used to treat \ndependence on opioid (narcotic) drugs such as heroin or morphine in drug addicts who have agreed \nto be treated for their addiction. Zubsolv is used in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age, \nwho are also receiving medical, social and psychological support. \n \nHow Zubsolv works \nThe tablet contains buprenorphine which is responsible for the treatment of opioid (narcotic) \ndependence. It also contains naloxone which is used to deter intravenous abuse of the product. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zubsolv \n \nDo not take Zubsolv if you: \n- are allergic to buprenorphine, naloxone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n- have serious breathing problems \n- have serious liver problems \n- are intoxicated due to alcohol or have trembling, sweating, anxiety, confusion, or \n\nhallucinations caused by alcohol \n- are taking naltrexone or nalmefene for the treatment of alcohol or opioid dependence \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n49  \n\n \n• Misuse, abuse and diversion \nSerious cases of infections with potential fatal outcome may occur if Zubsolv is misused, by taking \nit intravenously. \n \nThis medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines, and should be kept in a \nsafe place to protect it from theft. Do not give this medicine to anyone else. It can cause death or \notherwise harm them. \n \n• Breathing problems (see also ‘Do not take Zubsolv’ above ) \nSome people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused this \nmedicine or took it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, \nbenzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids. \n \nThe product should be used with care in patients with pre-existing breathing problems \n \nThis medicine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression (reduced ability to breathe) \nin children and non-opioid dependent people. \n \n• Drowsiness \nThis medicine can cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or other central \nnervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics). \n \n• Dependence \nThis product can cause dependence. \n \n• Liver damage \nLiver damage has been reported after taking buprenorphine/naloxone, especially when the medicine \nis misused. This could also be due to viral infections (chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, anorexia \nor use of other medicines that can harm your liver. Regular blood tests may be conducted by your \ndoctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell your doctor if you have any liver problems \nbefore you start treatment with Zubsolv. \n \n• Withdrawal symptoms \nThis product can cause withdrawal symptoms if you take it less than six hours after you use a \nshort-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, heroin) or less than 24 hours after you use a long-acting \nopioid such as methadone. \n \nZubsolv can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. \n \n• Blood pressure \nThis product may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you get \nup too quickly from sitting or lying down. \n \n• Children and adolescents \nYou may be more closely monitored by your doctor if you are below the age of 18. This medicine \nshould not be taken by those under 15 years of age. \n \n• Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions \nThis medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. Do not \nforget to advise your doctor if you take this medicine. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Zubsolv if you: \n• have a depression or other conditions that are treated with antidepressants. \n\nThe use of these medicines together with Zubsolv can lead to serotonin syndrome, a \npotentially life-threatening condition (see “Other medicines and Zubsolv”) \n\n\n\n50  \n\n• have kidney problems \n• have recently suffered a head injury or brain disease \n• have low blood pressure, enlarged prostate gland or difficulties passing water because \n\nof narrowing of the urethra \n• have under-active thyroid gland which can cause tiredness or weight gain \n• have poor adrenal gland function (e.g. Addison’s disease) \n• have problems with the biliary tract (e.g. gall bladder, bile duct) \n• are elderly \n• are debilitated \n \nOther medicines and Zubsolv \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nSome medicines may increase the side effects of Zubsolv and may sometimes cause very serious \nreactions. Do not take any other medicines whilst taking Zubsolv without first talking to your \ndoctor, especially: \n• anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, \n\nfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, \ndoxepine, or trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Zubsolv and you may \nexperience symptoms such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the \nmuscles that control movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive \nsweating, tremor, exaggeration of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature \nabove 38°C. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. \n\n• Naltrexone and nalmefene (drugs used to treat addictive disorders) as they may prevent \nthe therapeutic effects of Zubsolv. They must not be taken at the same time as Zubsolv \ntreatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense \nwithdrawal. \n\n• Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, \ntemazepam, alprazolam. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. Taking the \nwrong dose of benzodiazepines may cause death due to respiratory failure (inability \nto breathe). \n\n• Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such \nas anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain and other mental disorders. These \ntypes of medicines will reduce your alertness levels making it dangerous for you to drive \nand use machines. They may also cause central nervous system depression, which is very \nserious. Below is a list of examples of these types of medicines: \n- other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain pain killers and \n\ncough suppressants \n- some anti-depressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, \n\nselegiline, tranylcypromine, valproate and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may \nincrease the effects of this medicine \n\n- sedative Hı receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as \ndiphenhydramine and chlorphenamine \n\n- barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital \n- tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) and related medicines may extend the \n\neffects of this medicine \n• anti-retrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase \n\nthe effects of this medicine \n• some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole \n\nand certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine \n• some medicines may decrease the effect of Zubsolv. These include medicines used to \n\ntreat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin), and medicines used to treat \ntuberculosis (rifampicin) \n\n \nZubsolv with food, drink and alcohol \n\n\n\n51  \n\nAlcohol may increase drowsiness and may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with \nZubsolv. Do not take Zubsolv together with alcohol. Do not swallow or consume food or any \ndrink until the tablet is completely dissolved. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThe risks of using Zubsolv in pregnant women are not known. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or \nintend to become pregnant. Your doctor will decide if your treatment should be continued with an \nalternative medicine. \nWhen taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Zubsolv may cause drug \nwithdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear \nseveral days after birth. \n \nDo not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, since Zubsolv passes into breast milk. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZubsolv may cause drowsiness. This may happen more often in the first few weeks of treatment \nwhen your dose is being changed, but can also happen if you drink alcohol or take other sedative \nmedicines when you take Zubsolv. Do not drive, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous \nactivities until you know how this medicine affects you. \n \n \n3. How to take Zubsolv \n \nYour treatment is prescribed and monitored by doctors who are experienced in the treatment of drug \ndependence. \n \nYour doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the \ndose, depending upon your response. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nStarting treatment \nThe recommended starting dose for adults and adolescents over the age of 15 years is: \n \n\n- one tablet of Zubsolv 1.4 mg / 0.36 mg each day, or \n \n\n- one tablet of Zubsolv 2.9 mg / 0.71 mg each day \n \nAn additional tablet of the Zubsolv 1.4 mg / 0.36 mg or 2.9 mg / 0.71 mg may be administered on \nDay 1 depending on your needs. \n \nThere are other strengths that are available to be used by your doctor who will decide what is the \nbest treatment for you. This may involve taking a combination of different strengths, but your daily \ndose should not exceed 17.2mg of buprenorphine. \n \nClear signs of withdrawal should be evident before taking your first dose of Zubsolv. A doctor’s \nassessment of your readiness for treatment will guide the timing of your first Zubsolv dose. \n \n• Starting treatment of Zubsolv whilst dependent on heroin: \nIf you are dependent upon heroin or a short acting opioid, your first dose of Zubsolv should be \ntaken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 6 hours after you last used opioids \n \n• Starting treatment of Zubsolv whilst dependent on methadone: \nIf you have been taking methadone or a long acting opioid, the dose of methadone should ideally be \n\n\n\n52  \n\nreduced to below 30 mg/day before beginning Zubsolv therapy. The first dose of Zubsolv should be \ntaken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 24 hours after you last used methadone \n \nTaking Zubsolv \n• Take the dose once a day or as advised by your doctor. \n \n• Remove the tablet as described below. Only open the blister immediately before taking the \n\ndose.

Whilst you \n\nmay notice that most of the table disintegrates within 40 seconds, it may take 5 to 10 minutes \nfor the entire table to disappear from your mouth \n\n \nHow to remove the tablet from the blister \n\n \n \n \n \n\n1.
