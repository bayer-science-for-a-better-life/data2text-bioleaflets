CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nMelanoma \n\n \n\nTrametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult \n\npatients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\nTrametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a \n\nprior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAdjuvant treatment of melanoma \n\n \n\nTrametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients \n\nwith Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. \n\n \nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n\n \n\nTrametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \n\nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600 mutation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with trametinib should only be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the \n\nadministration of anti-cancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nBefore taking trametinib, patients must have confirmation of BRAF V600 mutation using a validated \n\ntest. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of trametinib, either used as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, \n\nis 2 mg once daily. The recommended dose of dabrafenib, when used in combination with trametinib, \n\nis 150 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that patients continue treatment with trametinib until patients no longer derive \n\nbenefit or the development of unacceptable toxicity (see Table 2). In the adjuvant melanoma setting, \n\npatients should be treated for a period of 12 months unless there is disease recurrence or unacceptable \n\ntoxicity. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\n \n\nIf a dose of trametinib is missed, it should only be taken if it is more than 12 hours until the next \n\nscheduled dose. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of dabrafenib is missed, when trametinib is given in combination with dabrafenib, the dose of \n\ndabrafenib should only be taken if it is more than 6 hours until the next scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nDose modification \n\n \n\nThe management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, treatment interruption or treatment \n\ndiscontinuation (see Tables 1 and 2). \n\n \n\nDose modifications are not recommended for adverse reactions of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma \n\n(cuSCC) or new primary melanoma (see dabrafenib SmPC for further details). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose level reductions \n\n \n\nDose level Trametinib dose \n\nUsed as monotherapy or in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib \n\nDabrafenib dose* \n\nOnly when used in combination with \n\ntrametinib \n\nStarting dose 2 mg once daily 150 mg twice daily \n\n1st dose reduction 1.5 mg once daily 100 mg twice daily \n\n2nd dose reduction 1 mg once daily 75 mg twice daily \n\n3rd dose reduction \n\n(combination only) \n\n1 mg once daily 50 mg twice daily \n\nDose adjustment for trametinib below 1 mg once daily is not recommended, whether used as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. Dose adjustment for dabrafenib below 50 mg \n\ntwice daily is not recommended when used in combination with trametinib. \n*Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC, Posology and method of administration, for dosing instructions for \n\ntreatment with dabrafenib monotherapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2 Dose modification schedule based on the grade of any adverse reactions \n\n \n\nGrade (CTC-AE)* Recommended trametinib dose modifications \n\nUsed as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib \n\nGrade 1 or Grade 2 \n\n(Tolerable) \n\nContinue treatment and monitor as clinically indicated. \n\nGrade 2 (Intolerable) or \n\nGrade 3   \n\nInterrupt therapy until toxicity is Grade 0 to 1 and reduce by one dose \n\nlevel when resuming therapy. \n\nGrade 4 Discontinue permanently, or interrupt therapy until Grade 0 to 1 and \n\nreduce by one dose level when resuming therapy. \n* The intensity of clinical adverse reactions graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \n\nEvents v4.0 (CTC-AE) \n\n \n\nWhen an individual’s adverse reactions are under effective management, dose re-escalation following \n\nthe same dosing steps as de-escalation may be considered. The trametinib dose should not exceed \n\n2 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nIf treatment-related toxicities occur when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib, then both \n\ntreatments should be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where dose \n\nmodifications are necessary for only one of the two treatments are detailed below for pyrexia, uveitis, \n\nRAS mutation positive non-cutaneous malignancies (primarily related to dabrafenib), left ventricular \n\nejection fraction (LVEF) reduction, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), retinal pigment epithelial \n\ndetachment (RPED) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (primarily related to trametinib). \n\n \n\nDose modification exceptions (where only one of the two therapies is dose reduced) for selected \n\nadverse reactions \n\n \n\nPyrexia \n\nWhen trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib and the patient’s temperature is ≥38.5oC \n\nplease refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.2) for dose modifications for dabrafenib. No dose \n\nmodification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nUveitis \n\nNo dose modifications are required for uveitis as long as effective local therapies can control ocular \n\ninflammation. If uveitis does not respond to local ocular therapy, dabrafenib should be withheld until \n\nresolution of ocular inflammation and then dabrafenib should be restarted reduced by one dose level. \n\nNo dose modification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nRAS-mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies \n\nThe benefits and risks must be considered before continuing treatment with dabrafenib in patients with \n\na non-cutaneous malignancy that has a RAS mutation. No dose modification of trametinib is required \n\nwhen taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction \n\nTrametinib should be interrupted in patients who have an asymptomatic, absolute decrease of >10% in \n\nLVEF compared to baseline and the ejection fraction is below the institution’s lower limit of normal \n\n(LLN) (see section 4.4). No dose modification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. If the LVEF recovers, treatment with trametinib may be restarted, but \n\nthe dose should be reduced by one dose level with careful monitoring (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTrametinib should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 or 4 left ventricular cardiac \n\ndysfunction or clinically significant LVEF reduction which does not recover within 4 weeks (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nRetinal vein occlusion (RVO) and retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) \n\nIf patients report new visual disturbances such as diminished central vision, blurred vision, or loss of \n\nvision at any time while on trametinib therapy, a prompt ophthalmological assessment is \n\nrecommended. In patients who are diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib, whether given as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, should be permanently discontinued. No dose \n\nmodification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in combination with dabrafenib. If \n\nRPED is diagnosed, follow the dose modification schedule in Table 3 below for trametinib (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 3 Recommended dose modifications for trametinib for RPED \n\n \n\nGrade 1 RPED Continue treatment with retinal evaluation monthly until \n\nresolution. If RPED worsens follow instructions below \n\nand withhold trametinib for up to 3 weeks. \n\nGrade 2-3 RPED Withhold trametinib for up to 3 weeks. \n\nGrade 2-3 RPED that improves to \n\nGrade 0-1 within 3 weeks \n\nResume trametinib at a lower dose (reduced by 0.5 mg) \n\nor discontinue trametinib in patients taking trametinib \n\n1 mg daily. \n\nGrade 2-3 RPED that does not improve \n\nto at least Grade 1 within 3 weeks \n\nPermanently discontinue trametinib. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n\nTrametinib must be withheld in patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients \n\npresenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnoea, \n\nhypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Trametinib must be \n\npermanently discontinued in patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. No dose \n\nmodification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in combination with dabrafenib for \n\ncases of ILD or pneumonitis. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nThere are no data with trametinib in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, the potential \n\nneed for starting dose adjustment cannot be determined. Trametinib should be used with caution in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment when administered as monotherapy or in combination with \n\ndabrafenib. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). There are \n\nno clinical data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, the potential need \n\nfor starting dose adjustment cannot be determined. Trametinib should be used with caution in patients \n\nwith moderate or severe hepatic impairment when administered as monotherapy or in combination \n\nwith dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nNon-Caucasian patients \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of trametinib in non-Caucasian patients have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nNo initial dose adjustment is required in patients >65 years of age. More frequent dose adjustments \n\n(see Tables 1 and 2 above) may be required in patients >65 years of age (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of trametinib have not been established in children and adolescents \n\n(<18 years). No data are available. Studies in juvenile animals have shown adverse effects of \n\ntrametinib which were not observed in adult animals (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTrametinib should be taken orally with a full glass of water. The tablets should not be chewed or \n\ncrushed and they should be taken without food, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the dose of trametinib is taken at a similar time every day. When trametinib \n\nand dabrafenib are taken in combination, the once-daily dose of trametinib should be taken at the same \n\ntime each day with either the morning dose or the evening dose of dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nIf a patient vomits after taking trametinib, the patient should not retake the dose and should take the \n\nnext scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to dabrafenib SmPC for information on method of administration when given in \n\ncombination with trametinib. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen trametinib is given in combination with dabrafenib, the SmPC of dabrafenib must be consulted \n\nprior to initiation of treatment. For additional information on warnings and precautions associated with \n\ndabrafenib treatment, please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC. \n\n \n\nBRAF V600 testing \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of trametinib have not been evaluated in patients whose melanoma tested \n\nnegative for the BRAF V600 mutation. \n\n \n\nTrametinib monotherapy compared to BRAF inhibitors \n\n \n\nTrametinib monotherapy has not been compared with a BRAF inhibitor in a clinical study in patients \n\nwith BRAF V600 mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Based on cross-study \n\ncomparisons, overall survival and progression-free survival data appear to show similar effectiveness \n\nbetween trametinib and BRAF inhibitors; however, overall response rates were lower in patients \n\ntreated with trametinib than those reported in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. \n\n \n\nTrametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with melanoma who have progressed on a \n\nBRAF inhibitor \n\n \n\nThere are limited data in patients taking the combination of trametinib with dabrafenib who have \n\nprogressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor. These data show that the efficacy of the combination will be \n\nlower in these patients (see section 5.1). Therefore other treatment options should be considered before \n\ntreatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. The sequencing of \n\ntreatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been established. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNew malignancies \n\n \n\nNew malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when trametinib is used in combination \n\nwith dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nCutaneous malignancies \n\n \n\nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) \n\nCases of cuSCC (including keratoacanthoma) have been reported in patients treated with trametinib in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. Cases of cuSCC can be managed with excision and do not require \n\ntreatment modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNew primary melanoma \n\nNew primary melanoma was reported in patients receiving trametinib in combination with dabrafenib. \n\nCases of new primary melanoma can be managed with excision and do not require treatment \n\nmodification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNon-cutaneous malignancies \n\n \n\nBased on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may increase the risk of non-cutaneous malignancies \n\nwhen RAS mutations are present. When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib please refer \n\nto the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). No dose modification of trametinib is required for RAS \n\nmutation positive malignancies when taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nHaemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events and fatal haemorrhages, have occurred in \n\npatients taking trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The \n\npotential for these events in patients with low platelet counts (<75,000) has not been established as \n\nsuch patients were excluded from clinical trials. The risk of haemorrhage may be increased with \n\nconcomitant use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. If haemorrhage occurs, patients should be \n\ntreated as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nLVEF reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction \n\n \n\nTrametinib has been reported to decrease LVEF, when used as monotherapy or in combination with \n\ndabrafenib (see section 4.8). In clinical trials, the median time to onset of the first occurrence of left \n\nventricular dysfunction, cardiac failure and LVEF decrease was between 2 and 5 months. \n\n \n\nTrametinib should be used with caution in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Patients \n\nwith left ventricular dysfunction, New York Heart Association Class II, III, or IV heart failure, acute \n\ncoronary syndrome within the past 6 months, clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, and \n\nuncontrolled hypertension were excluded from clinical trials; safety of use in this population is \n\ntherefore unknown. LVEF should be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of treatment with \n\ntrametinib, one month after initiation of therapy, and then at approximately 3-monthly intervals while \n\non treatment (see section 4.2 regarding dose modification). \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving trametinib in combination with dabrafenib, there have been occasional reports of \n\nacute, severe left ventricular dysfunction due to myocarditis. Full recovery was observed when \n\nstopping treatment. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of myocarditis in patients who develop \n\nnew or worsening cardiac signs or symptoms. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPyrexia \n\n \n\nFever has been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with \n\ndabrafenib (see section 4.8). The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with the combination \n\ntherapy (see dabrafenib SmPC section 4.4). In patients receiving trametinib in combination with \n\ndabrafenib, pyrexia may be accompanied by severe rigors, dehydration, and hypotension which in \n\nsome cases can lead to acute renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nWhen trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib and the patient’s temperature is ≥38.5oC \n\nplease refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.2) for dose modifications for dabrafenib. No dose \n\nmodification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\n \n\nElevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with trametinib as monotherapy and in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension (see section 4.8). \n\nBlood pressure should be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment with trametinib, with \n\ncontrol of hypertension by standard therapy as appropriate. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nIn a Phase III trial, 2.4% (5/211) of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy developed ILD or \n\npneumonitis; all five patients required hospitalisation. The median time to first presentation of ILD or \n\npneumonitis was 160 days (range: 60 to 172 days). In studies MEK115306 and MEK116513 <1% \n\n(2/209) and 1 % (4/350), respectively, of patients treated with trametinib in combination with \n\ndabrafenib developed pneumonitis or ILD (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nTrametinib should be withheld in patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients \n\npresenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnoea, \n\nhypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Trametinib should be \n\npermanently discontinued for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis (see \n\nsection 4.2). If trametinib is being used in combination with dabrafenib then therapy with dabrafenib \n\nmay be continued at the same dose. \n\n \n\nVisual impairment \n\n \n\nDisorders associated with visual disturbance, including RPED and RVO, may occur with trametinib as \n\nmonotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib. Symptoms such as blurred vision, decreased acuity, \n\nand other visual phenomena have been reported in the clinical trials with trametinib (see section 4.8). \n\nIn clinical trials uveitis and iridocyclitis have also been reported in patients treated with trametinib in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nTrametinib is not recommended in patients with a history of RVO. The safety of trametinib in subjects \n\nwith predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, \n\nuncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or a history of hyperviscosity or \n\nhypercoagulability syndromes, has not been established. \n\n \n\nIf patients report new visual disturbances, such as diminished central vision, blurred vision or loss of \n\nvision at any time while on trametinib therapy, a prompt ophthalmological assessment is \n\nrecommended. If RPED is diagnosed, the dose modification schedule in Table 3 should be followed \n\n(see section 4.2); if uveitis is diagnosed, please refer to dabrafenib SmPC section 4.4. In patients who \n\nare diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib should be permanently discontinued. No dose \n\nmodification of dabrafenib is required when taken in combination with trametinib following diagnosis \n\nof RVO or RPED. No dose modification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with \n\ndabrafenib following diagnosis of uveitis. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nRash \n\n \n\nRash has been observed in about 60% of patients in trametinib monotherapy studies and in about 24% \n\nof patients when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The majority of \n\nthese cases were Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any dose interruptions or dose reductions. \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib as monotherapy or in combination \n\nwith dabrafenib (see section 4.8). In some cases, patients were able to continue trametinib. In more \n\nsevere cases hospitalisation, interruption or permanent discontinuation of trametinib or trametinib and \n\ndabrafenib combination was required. Signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis should warrant an \n\nappropriate clinical evaluation and treatment as indicated. \n\n \n\nRenal failure \n\n \n\nRenal failure has been identified in patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in \n\nclinical trials. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\n \n\nPancreatitis has been reported in patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in \n\nclinical trials. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic events \n\n \n\nHepatic adverse  reactions have been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients receiving treatment \n\nwith trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib have liver function monitored every \n\nfour weeks for 6 months after treatment initiation with trametinib. Liver monitoring may be continued \n\nthereafter as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nAs metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes of elimination of trametinib, administration \n\nof trametinib should be undertaken with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE) \n\n \n\nPulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis can occur when trametinib is used as monotherapy or in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. If patients develop symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep vein \n\nthrombosis such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling, they should immediately \n\nseek medical care. Permanently discontinue trametinib and dabrafenib for life-threatening pulmonary \n\nembolism. \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and drug \n\nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, \n\nhave been reported during treatment with dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Before initiating \n\ntreatment, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin \n\nreactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of SCARs appear, dabrafenib and trametinib should be \n\nwithdrawn. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nColitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcome, have been reported in patients taking \n\ntrametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). Treatment with \n\ntrametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib should be used with caution in patients \n\nwith risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation, including history of diverticulitis, metastases to the \n\ngastrointestinal tract and concomitant use of medicinal products with a recognised risk of \n\ngastrointestinal perforation. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on trametinib \n\n \n\nAs trametinib is metabolised predominantly via deacetylation mediated by hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. \n\ncarboxyl-esterases), its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic \n\ninteractions (see section 5.2). Drug-drug interactions via these hydrolytic enzymes cannot be ruled out \n\nand could influence the exposure to trametinib. \n\n \n\nTrametinib is an in vitro substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. As it cannot be excluded that strong \n\ninhibition of hepatic P-gp may result in increased levels of trametinib, caution is advised when \n\nco-administering trametinib with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. verapamil, \n\ncyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, itraconazole). \n\n \n\nEffect of trametinib on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro and in vivo data, trametinib is unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of \n\nother medicinal products via interaction with CYP enzymes or transporters (see section 5.2). \n\nTrametinib may result in transient inhibition of BCRP substrates (e.g. pitavastatin) in the gut, which \n\nmay be minimised with staggered dosing (2 hours apart) of these agents and trametinib. \n\n \n\nCombination with dabrafenib \n\n \n\nWhen trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the dabrafenib \n\nSmPC for interactions. \n\n \n\nEffect of food on trametinib \n\n \n\nPatients should take trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib at least one hour \n\nprior to or two hours after a meal due to the effect of food on trametinib absorption (see section 4.2 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \n\n \n\nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be advised to use effective methods of contraception \n\nduring treatment with trametinib and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment. \n\n \n\nIt is currently unknown if hormonal contraceptives are affected by trametinib. To prevent pregnancy, \n\nfemale patients using hormonal contraception are advised to use an additional or alternative method \n\nduring treatment and for 16 weeks following discontinuation of trametinib. \n\n \n\nUse with dabrafenib may render hormonal contraceptives less effective and therefore an alternative \n\nmethod of contraception, such as a barrier method, should be used when trametinib is used in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of trametinib in pregnant women. Animal studies \n\nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Trametinib should not be administered to pregnant \n\nwomen. If trametinib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking \n\ntrametinib, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether trametinib is excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products are \n\nexcreted in human milk, a risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. Trametinib should not \n\nbe administered to breast-feeding mothers. A decision should be made whether to discontinue \n\nbreast-feeding or discontinue trametinib, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \n\nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data in humans for trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. In \n\nanimals, no fertility studies have been performed, but adverse effects were seen on female \n\nreproductive organs (see section 5.3). Trametinib may impair fertility in humans. \n\n \n\nMen taking trametinib in combination with dabrafenib \n\n \n\nEffects on spermatogenesis have been observed in animals given dabrafenib. Male patients taking \n\ntrametinib in combination with dabrafenib should be informed of the potential risk for impaired \n\nspermatogenesis, which may be irreversible. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nTrametinib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. The clinical status of the \n\npatient and the adverse reaction profile should be borne in mind when considering the patient’s ability \n\nto perform tasks that require judgement, motor and cognitive skills. Patients should be made aware of \n\npotential for fatigue, dizziness or eye problems that might affect these activities. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of trametinib monotherapy has been evaluated in the integrated safety population of \n\n329 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with trametinib \n\n2 mg once daily in studies MEK114267, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Of these patients, 211 were \n\ntreated with trametinib for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma in the randomised open-label Phase III \n\nstudy MEK114267 (METRIC) (see section 5.1). The most common adverse reactions (incidence \n\n≥20%) for trametinib were rash, diarrhoea, fatigue, oedema peripheral, nausea, and dermatitis \n\nacneiform. \n\n \n\nThe safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib has been evaluated in the integrated safety \n\npopulation of 1,076 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Stage III \n\nBRAF V600 mutant melanoma following complete resection (adjuvant treatment) and advanced \n\nNSCLC treated with trametinib 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. Of these patients, \n\n559 were treated with the combination for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma in two randomised Phase III \n\nstudies, MEK115306 (COMBI-d) and MEK116513 (COMBI-v), 435 were treated with the \n\ncombination in the adjuvant treatment of Stage III BRAF V600 mutant melanoma after complete \n\nresection in a randomised Phase III study BRF115532 (COMBI-AD) and 82 were treated with the \n\ncombination for BRAF V600 mutant NSCLC in a multi-cohort, non-randomised Phase II study \n\nBRF113928 (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence 20%) for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib \n\nwere: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, chills, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, arthralgia and rash. \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class. \n\nThe following convention has been utilised for the classification of frequency: \n\nVery common ≥1/10 \n\nCommon  ≥1/100 to <1/10 \n\nUncommon  ≥1/1,000 to <1/100 \n\nRare   1/10,000 to <1/1,000 \n\nNot known  (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\nCategories have been assigned based on absolute frequencies in the clinical trial data.

bleeding and fatal bleeding \ng Abdominal pain upper and abdominal pain lower \nh Erythema, generalised erythema \ni Muscle spasms, musculoskeletal stiffness \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nNew malignancies \n\n \n\nNew malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when trametinib is used in combination \n\nwith dabrafenib. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nHaemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events and fatal haemorrhages, occurred in \n\npatients taking trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib. The majority of \n\nbleeding events were mild. Fatal intracranial haemorrhages occurred in the integrated safety \n\npopulation of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in <1% (8/1076) of patients. The median time \n\nto onset of the first occurrence of haemorrhagic events for the combination of trametinib and \n\ndabrafenib was 94 days in the melanoma Phase III studies and 75 days in the NSCLC study for the \n\npatients who had received prior anti-cancer therapy. \n\n \n\nThe risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant \n\ntherapy. If haemorrhage occurs, treat as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLVEF reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction \n\n \n\nTrametinib has been reported to decrease LVEF when used as monotherapy or in combination with \n\ndabrafenib. In clinical trials, the median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac \n\nfailure and LVEF decrease was between 2 to 5 months. In the integrated safety population of \n\ntrametinib in combination with dabrafenib, decreased LVEF has been reported in 6% (65/1076) of \n\npatients, with most cases being asymptomatic and reversible. Patients with LVEF lower than the \n\ninstitutional lower limit of normal were not included in clinical trials with trametinib. Trametinib \n\nshould be used with caution in patients with conditions that could impair left ventricular function (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPyrexia \n\n \n\nPyrexia has been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with \n\ndabrafenib; however, the incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with the combination \n\ntherapy. Please refer to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the dabrafenib SmPC. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nHepatic events \n\n \n\nHepatic adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. Of the hepatic adverse reactions, increased ALT and AST were the most \n\ncommon events and the majority were either Grade 1 or 2. For trametinib monotherapy, more than \n\n90% of these liver events occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. Liver events were detected \n\nin clinical trials with monitoring every four weeks. It is recommended that patients receiving treatment \n\nwith trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib have liver function monitored every \n\nfour weeks for 6 months. Liver monitoring may be continued thereafter as clinically indicated (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\n \n\nElevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with trametinib as monotherapy and in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension. Blood pressure \n\nshould be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment, with control of hypertension by \n\nstandard therapy as appropriate (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nPatients treated with trametinib or combination with dabrafenib may develop ILD or pneumonitis. \n\nTrametinib should be withheld in patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients \n\npresenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnoea, \n\nhypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. For patients diagnosed with \n\ntreatment-related ILD or pneumonitis trametinib should be permanently discontinued (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). \n\n \n\nVisual impairment \n\n \n\nDisorders associated with visual disturbances, including RPED and RVO, have been observed with \n\ntrametinib. Symptoms such as blurred vision, decreased acuity, and other visual disturbances have \n\nbeen reported in the clinical trials with trametinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRash \n\n \n\nRash has been observed in about 60% of patients when given as monotherapy and in about 24% of \n\npatients in trametinib and dabrafenib combination studies in the integrated safety population. The \n\nmajority of these cases were Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any dose interruptions or dose reductions \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib alone or in combination with \n\ndabrafenib. Signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis should warrant an appropriate clinical evaluation \n\nand treatment as indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\n \n\nPancreatitis has been reported with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Please see the \n\ndabrafenib SmPC. \n\n \n\nRenal failure \n\n \n\nRenal failure has been reported with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Please see the \n\ndabrafenib SmPC. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nIn the Phase III study with trametinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (n=211), \n\n49 patients (23%) were ≥65 years of age, and 9 patients (4%) were ≥75 years of age. The proportion of \n\nsubjects experiencing adverse reactions (AR) and serious adverse reactions (SAR) was similar in the \n\nsubjects aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years. Patients ≥65 years were more likely to experience \n\nARs leading to permanent discontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and dose interruption \n\nthan those <65 years. \n\n \n\nIn the integrated safety population of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib (n=1,076) \n\n265 patients (25%) were ≥65 years of age; 62 patients (6%) were ≥75 years of age. The proportion of \n\npatients experiencing ARs was similar in those aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years in all studies. \n\nPatients ≥65 years were more likely to experience SARs and ARs leading to permanent \n\ndiscontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and dose interruption than those <65 years. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nTrametinib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nTrametinib should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nTrametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with brain metastases \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib have been evaluated in a \n\nmulti-cohort, open-label, Phase II study in patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanoma with brain \n\nmetastases. The safety profile observed in these patients appears to be consistent with the integrated \n\nsafety profile of the combination. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn clinical trials with trametinib monotherapy one case of accidental overdose was reported; a single \n\ndose of 4 mg. No AEs were reported following this event of trametinib overdose. In clinical trials with \n\nthe combination of trametinib and dabrafenib 11 patients reported trametinib overdose (4 mg); no \n\nSAEs were reported. There is no specific treatment for overdose. If overdose occurs, the patient should \n\nbe treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE25 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTrametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular \n\nsignal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and kinase activity. MEK proteins are \n\ncomponents of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. In melanoma and other cancers, \n\nthis pathway is often activated by mutated forms of BRAF which activates MEK. Trametinib inhibits \n\nactivation of MEK by BRAF and inhibits MEK kinase activity. Trametinib inhibits growth of BRAF \n\nV600 mutant melanoma cell lines and demonstrates anti-tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant \n\nmelanoma animal models. \n\n \n\nCombination with dabrafenib \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is an inhibitor of RAF kinases. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF lead to constitutive \n\nactivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Thus, trametinib and dabrafenib inhibit two kinases \n\nin this pathway, MEK and RAF, and therefore the combination provides concomitant inhibition of the \n\npathway. The combination of trametinib with dabrafenib has shown anti-tumour activity in BRAF \n\nV600 mutation positive melanoma cell lines in vitro and delays the emergence of resistance in vivo in \n\nBRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts. \n\n \n\nDetermination of BRAF mutation status \n\n \n\nBefore taking trametinib or the combination with dabrafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 \n\nmutation-positive tumour status confirmed by a validated test. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, central testing for BRAF V600 mutation using a BRAF mutation assay was \n\nconducted on the most recent tumour sample available. Primary tumour or tumour from a metastatic \n\nsite was tested with a validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay developed by Response \n\nGenetics Inc. The assay was specifically designed to differentiate between the V600E and V600K \n\nmutations. Only patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive tumours were eligible for \n\nstudy participation. \n\n \n\nSubsequently, all patient samples were re-tested using the CE-marked bioMerieux (bMx) THxID \n\nBRAF validated assay. The bMx THxID BRAF assay is an allele-specific PCR performed on DNA \n\nextracted from FFPE tumour tissue. The assay was designed to detect the BRAF V600E and V600K \n\nmutations with high sensitivity (down to 5% V600E and V600K sequence in a background of \n\nwild-type sequence using DNA extracted from FFPE tissue). Non-clinical and clinical trials with \n\nretrospective bi-directional Sanger sequencing analyses have shown that the test also detects the less \n\ncommon BRAF V600D mutation and V600E/K601E mutation with lower sensitivity. Of the \n\nspecimens from the non-clinical and clinical trials (n=876) that were mutation positive by the THxID \n\nBRAF assay and subsequently were sequenced using the reference method, the specificity of the assay \n\nwas 94%. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nTrametinib suppressed levels of phosphorylated ERK in BRAF mutant melanoma tumour cell lines \n\nand melanoma xenograft models. \n\n \n\nIn patients with BRAF and NRAS mutation positive melanoma, administration of trametinib resulted \n\nin dose-dependent changes in tumour biomarkers including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK, \n\ninhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and increases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis). The \n\nmean trametinib concentrations observed following repeat dose administration of 2 mg once daily \n\nexceeds the preclinical target concentration over the 24-hr dosing interval, thereby providing sustained \n\ninhibition of the MEK pathway. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nUnresectable or metastatic melanoma \n\n \n\nIn the clinical trials only patients with cutaneous melanoma were studied. Efficacy in patients with \n\nocular or mucosal melanoma has not been assessed. \n\n \n\n Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib \n \n\nTreatment naïve patients \n\nThe efficacy and safety of the recommended dose of trametinib (2 mg once daily) in combination with \n\ndabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \n\nmelanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation was studied in two Phase III studies and one supportive \n\nPhase I/II study. \n\n \n\nMEK115306 (COMBI-d): \n\nMEK115306 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded study comparing the combination of \n\ndabrafenib and trametinib to dabrafenib and placebo in first-line therapy for subjects with unresectable \n\n(Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. The \n\nprimary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), with a key secondary endpoint of \n\noverall survival (OS). Subjects were stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit \n\nof normal (ULN) versus ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K). \n\n \n\nA total of 423 subjects were randomised 1:1 to either combination (N=211) or dabrafenib (N=212). \n\nMost subjects were Caucasian (>99%) and male (53%), with a median age of 56 years (28% were \n\n≥65 years). The majority of subjects had Stage IVM1c disease (67%). Most subjects had LDH ≤ULN \n\n(65%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (72%), and visceral \n\ndisease (73%) at baseline. The majority of subjects had a BRAF V600E mutation (85%). Subjects with \n\nbrain metastases were not included in the trial. \n\n \n\nMedian OS and estimated 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year survival rates are presented in \n\nTable 6. From an OS analysis at 5 years, the median OS for the combination arm was approximately \n\n7 months longer than for dabrafenib monotherapy (25.8 months versus 18.7 months) with 5-year \n\nsurvival rates of 32% for the combination versus 27% for dabrafenib monotherapy (Table 6, Figure 1). \n\nThe Kaplan-Meier OS curve appears to stabilise from 3 to 5 years (see Figure 1). The 5-year overall \n\nsurvival rate was 40% (95% CI: 31.2, 48.4) in the combination arm versus 33% (95% CI: 25.0, 41.0) \n\nin the dabrafenib monotherapy arm for patients who had a normal lactate dehydrogenase level at \n\nbaseline, and 16% (95% CI: 8.4, 26.0) in the combination arm versus 14% (95% CI: 6.8, 23.1) in the \n\ndabrafenib monotherapy arm for patients with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level at baseline. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 6 Overall Survival results for Study MEK115306 (COMBI-d) \n\n \n\n \nOS analysis \n\n(data cut-off: 12-Jan-2015) \n\n5-year OS analysis \n\n(data cut-off: 10-Dec-2018) \n\n \n\nDabrafenib + \n\nTrametinib \n\n(n=211) \n\nDabrafenib + \n\nPlacebo \n\n(n=212) \n\nDabrafenib + \n\nTrametinib \n\n(n=211) \n\nDabrafenib+ \n\nPlacebo \n\n(n=212) \n\nNumber of patients \n\nDied (event), n \n\n(%) \n99 (47) 123 (58) 135 (64) 151 (71) \n\nEstimates of OS (months) \n\nMedian (95% CI) \n25.1 \n\n(19.2, NR) \n\n18.7 \n\n(15.2, 23.7) \n\n25.8 \n\n(19.2, 38.2) \n\n18.7 \n\n(15.2, 23.1) \n\nHazard ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n0.71 \n\n(0.55, 0.92) \n\n0.80 \n\n(0.63, 1.01) \n\np-value 0.011 NA \n\nOverall survival \n\nestimate, % (95% \n\nCI) \n\nDabrafenib + Trametinib \n\n(n=211) \n\nDabrafenib + Placebo \n\n(n=212) \n\nAt 1 year 74 (66.8, 79.0) 68 (60.8, 73.5) \n\nAt 2 years 52 (44.7, 58.6) 42 (35.4, 48.9) \n\nAt 3 years 43 (36.2, 50.1) 31 (25.1, 37.9) \n\nAt 4 years 35 (28.2, 41.8) 29 (22.7, 35.2) \n\nAt 5 years 32 (25.1, 38.3) 27 (20.7, 33.0) \nNR = Not reached, NA = Not applicable \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves for Study MEK115306 (ITT population) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nE\ns\nti\n\nm\na\nte\n\nd\n S\n\nu\nrv\n\niv\na\nl \nF\n\nu\nn\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n1.0 \n\nTime since Randomisation (Months) \n0 6 1 2 1 8 2 4 3 0 3 6 4 2 4 8 5 4 6 0 6 6 7 2 78 \n\nSubjects at Risk: \n\n211 188 145 113 98 86 79 71 63 60 57 54 12 0 \n212 175 137 104 84 69 60 56 54 51 50 46 10 0 \n\nDabrafenib + Placebo \nDabrafenib + Trametinib \n\nDabrafenib + Placebo \nDabrafenib + Trametinib \n\n\n\n22 \n\nImprovements for the primary endpoint of PFS were sustained over a 5 year timeframe in the \n\ncombination arm compared to dabrafenib monotherapy.

In these patients a 13% (95% CI: 5.0, 27.0) confirmed response \n\nrate was observed with a median PFS of 3.6 months (95% CI: 2, 4). \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPatients with brain metastases \n\nThe efficacy and safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with BRAF \n\nmutant-positive melanoma that has metastasised to the brain was studied in a non-randomised, \n\nopen-label, multicentre, Phase II study (COMBI-MB study). A total of 125 patients were enrolled into \n\nfour cohorts: \n\n Cohort A: patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases \nwithout prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. \n\n Cohort B: patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases \nwith prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 0 or1. \n\n Cohort C: patients with BRAFV600D/K/R mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain \nmetastases, with or without prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of \n\n0 or 1. \n\n Cohort D:  patients with BRAFV600D/E/K/R mutant melanoma with symptomatic brain \nmetastases, with or without prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of \n\n0 or 1 or 2. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was intracranial response in Cohort A, defined as the percentage of \n\npatients with a confirmed intracranial response assessed by the investigator using modified Response \n\nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Intracranial response assessed by the \n\ninvestigator in Cohorts B, C and D were secondary endpoints of the study. Due to small sample size \n\nreflected by wide 95% CIs, the results in Cohorts B, C, and D should be interpreted with caution. \n\nEfficacy results are summarised in Table 10. \n\n \n\nTable 10 Efficacy data by investigator assessment from COMBI-MB study \n\n \n\n All treated patients population \n\nEndpoints/ \n\nassessment \n\nCohort A \n\nN=76 \n\nCohort B \n\nN=16 \n\nCohort C \n\nN=16 \n\nCohort D \n\nN=17 \n\nIntracranial response rate, % (95 % CI) \n\n 59% \n\n(47.3, 70.4) \n\n56% \n\n(29.9, 80.2) \n\n44% \n\n(19.8, 70.1) \n\n59% \n\n(32.9, 81.6) \n\nDuration of intracranial response, median, months (95% CI) \n\n 6.5 \n\n(4.9, 8.6) \n\n7.3 \n\n(3.6, 12.6) \n\n8.3 \n\n(1.3, 15.0) \n\n4.5 \n\n(2.8, 5.9) \n\nOverall response rate, % (95% CI) \n\n 59% \n\n(47.3, 70.4) \n\n56% \n\n(29.9, 80.2) \n\n44% \n\n(19.8, 70.1) \n\n65% \n\n(38.3, 85.8) \n\nProgression-free survival, median, months (95% CI) \n\n 5.7 \n\n(5.3, 7.3) \n\n7.2 \n\n(4.7, 14.6) \n\n3.7 \n\n(1.7, 6.5) \n\n5.5 \n\n(3.7, 11.6) \n\nOverall survival, median, months (95% CI)  \n10.8 \n\n(8.7, 17.9) \n\n24.3 \n\n(7.9, NR) \n\n10.1 \n\n(4.6, 17.6) \n\n11.5 \n\n(6.8, 22.4) \nCI = Confidence Interval \n\nNR = Not reached \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n Trametinib monotherapy \n \n\nTreatment naïve patients \n\nThe efficacy and safety of trametinib in patients with BRAF unresectable or metastatic mutant \n\nmelanoma (V600E and V600K) were evaluated in a randomised open-label Phase III study \n\n(MEK114267 [METRIC]). Measurement of patients’ BRAF V600 mutation status was required. \n\n \n\nPatients (N=322) who were treatment naïve or may have received one prior chemotherapy treatment in \n\nthe metastatic setting [Intent to Treat (ITT) population] were randomised 2:1 to receive trametinib \n\n2 mg once daily or chemotherapy (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 \n\nevery 3 weeks). Treatment for all patients continued until disease progression, death or withdrawal. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of trametinib compared to \n\nchemotherapy with respect to PFS in patients with advanced/metastatic BRAF V600E/K \n\nmutation-positive melanoma without a prior history of brain metastases (N=273) which is considered \n\nthe primary efficacy population. The secondary endpoints were PFS in the ITT population and OS, \n\nORR, and DoR in the primary efficacy population and ITT population. Patients in the chemotherapy \n\narm were allowed to cross over to the trametinib arm after independent confirmation of progression. \n\nOf the patients with confirmed disease progression in the chemotherapy arm, a total of 51 (47%) \n\ncrossed over to receive trametinib. \n\n \n\nBaseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups in the primary efficacy population \n\nand the ITT population. In the ITT population, 54% of patients were male and all were Caucasian. The \n\nmedian age was 54 years (22% were 65 years); all patients had an ECOG performance score of 0 or \n\n1; and 3 % had history of brain metastases. Most patients (87%) in the ITT population had BRAF \n\nV600E mutation and 12% of patients had BRAF V600K. Most patients (66%) received no prior \n\nchemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy results in the primary efficacy population were consistent with those in the ITT \n\npopulation; therefore, only the efficacy data for the ITT population are presented in Table 11. \n\nKaplan-Meier curves of investigator-assessed OS (post-hoc analysis 20 May 2013) is presented in \n\nFigure 3. \n\n \n\nTable 11 Investigator-assessed efficacy results (ITT population) \n\n \n\nEndpoint Trametinib Chemotherapya \n\nProgression-Free Survival (N=214) (N=108) \n\nMedian PFS (months) \n\n (95% CI) \n\n4.8 \n\n(4.3, 4.9) \n\n1.5 \n\n(1.4, 2.7) \n\nHazard Ratio \n\n (95% CI) \n\n P value \n\n0.45 \n\n(0.33, 0.63) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nOverall Response Rate (%) 22 8 \nITT = Intent to Treat; PFS = Progression-free survival; CI = confidence interval. \na Chemotherapy included patients on dacarbazine (DTIC) 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel \n\n175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. \n\n \n\nThe PFS result was consistent in the subgroup of patients with V600K mutation positive melanoma \n\n(HR=0.50; [95% CI: 0.18, 1.35], p=0.0788). \n\n \n\nAn additional OS analysis was undertaken based upon the 20 May 2013 data cut, see Table 12. \n\n \n\nFor October 2011, 47% of subjects had crossed over, while for May 2013, 65% of subjects had \n\ncrossed over. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 12 Survival data from the primary and post-hoc analyses \n\n \n\nCut-off \n\ndates \n\nTreatment Number \n\nof deaths \n\n(%) \n\nMedian \n\nmonths OS \n\n(95% CI) \n\nHazard ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\nPercent \n\nsurvival at \n\n12 months \n\n(95% CI) \n\nOctober 26, \n\n2011 \n\nChemotherapy \n\n(n=108) \n\n29 (27) NR  \n\n0.54 (0.32, 0.92) \n\nNR \n\nTrametinib \n\n(n=214) \n\n35 (16) NR NR \n\nMay 20, \n\n2013 \n\nChemotherapy \n\n(n=108) \n\n67 (62) 11.3 (7.2, 14.8)  \n\n0.78 (0.57, 1.06) \n\n50 (39,59) \n\nTrametinib \n\n(n=214) \n\n137 (64) 15.6 (14.0, \n\n17.4) \n\n61(54, 67) \n\nNR=not reached \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival (OS –ad hoc analysis 20 May 2013) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPrior BRAF inhibitor therapy \n\nIn a single-arm Phase II study, designed to evaluate the objective response rate, safety, and \n\npharmacokinetics following dosing of trametinib at 2 mg once daily in patients with BRAF V600E, \n\nV600K, or V600D mutation-positive metastatic melanoma (MEK113583), two separate cohorts were \n\nenrolled: Cohort A: patients with prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor either with or without other \n\nprior therapy, Cohort B: patients with at least 1 prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, without prior \n\ntreatment with a BRAF inhibitor. \n\n \n\nIn Cohort A of this study, trametinib did not demonstrate clinical activity in patients who had \n\nprogressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. \n\n \n\nAdjuvant treatment of Stage III melanoma \n\n \n\nBRF115532 (COMBI-AD) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib were studied in a Phase III, \n\nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with Stage III (Stage IIIA \n\n[lymph node metastasis >1 mm], IIIB, or IIIC) cutaneous melanoma with a BRAF V600 E/K \n\nmutation, following complete resection. \n\n \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1 to receive either combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily \n\nand trametinib 2 mg once daily) or two placebos for a period of 12 months. Enrollment required \n\ncomplete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to \n\nrandomisation. Any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, was not allowed. \n\nPatients with a history of prior malignancy, if disease-free for at least 5 years, were eligible. Patients \n\npresenting with malignancies with confirmed activating RAS mutations were not eligible. Patients \n\nwere stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E versus V600K) and stage of disease prior to surgery \n\nusing the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition Melanoma Staging System (by \n\nStage III sub-stage, indicating different levels of lymph node involvement and primary tumour size \n\nand ulceration). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed relapse-free survival (RFS), defined \n\nas the time from randomisation to disease recurrence or death from any cause. Radiological tumour \n\nassessment was conducted every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter, until \n\nfirst relapse was observed. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS; key secondary \n\nendpoint), freedom from relapse (FFR) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). \n\n \n\nA total of 870 patients were randomised to the combination therapy (n=438) and placebo (n=432) \n\narms. Most patients were Caucasian (99%) and male (55%), with a median age of 51 years (18% were \n\n≥65 years). The study included patients with all sub-stages of Stage III disease prior to resection; 18% \n\nof these patients had lymph node involvement only identifiable by microscope and no primary tumour \n\nulceration. The majority of patients had a BRAF V600E mutation (91%). The median duration of \n\nfollow-up (time from randomisation to last contact or death) was 2.83 years in the dabrafenib and \n\ntrametinib combination arm and 2.75 years in the placebo arm. \n\n \n\nResults for the primary analysis of RFS are presented in Table 13. The study showed a statistically \n\nsignificant difference for the primary outcome of RFS between treatment arms, with a median RFS of \n\n16.6 months for the placebo arm and not yet reached for the combination arm (HR: 0.47; 95% \n\nconfidence interval: (0.39, 0.58); p=1.53×10-14).

ORR, DoR and PFS were also assessed by an Independent Review Committee \n\n(IRC) as a sensitivity analysis. \n\n \n\nCohorts were enrolled sequentially: \n\n Cohort A: Monotherapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily), 84 patients enrolled. 78 patients had \nprevious systemic treatment for their metastatic disease. \n\n Cohort B: Combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once \ndaily), 59 patients enrolled. 57 patients had 1-3 lines of previous systemic treatment for their \n\nmetastatic disease. 2 patients had no previous systemic treatment and were included in the \n\nanalysis for patients enrolled in Cohort C. \n\n Cohort C: Combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once \ndaily), 34 patients. All patients received study medicinal product as first-line treatment for \n\nmetastatic disease. \n\n \n\nAmong the total of 93 patients who were enrolled in the combination therapy cohorts B and C, most \n\npatients were Caucasian (>90%), and similar female versus male (54% versus 46%), with a median \n\nage of 64 years in second-line or higher patients and 68 years in the first-line patients. Most patients \n\n(94%) enrolled in the combination-therapy-treated cohorts had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. \n\n26 (28%) had never smoked. The majority of patients had a non-squamous histology. In the \n\npreviously-treated population, 38 patients (67%) had one line of systemic anti-cancer therapy for \n\nmetastatic disease. \n\n \n\nFor the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR, the ORR in the first-line population was \n\n61.1% (95% CI, 43.5%, 76.9%) and in the previously-treated population was 66.7% (95% CI, 52.9%, \n\n78.6%). These met the statistical significance to reject the null hypothesis that the ORR of dabrafenib \n\nin combination with trametinib for this NSCLC population was less than or equal to 30%. The ORR \n\nresults assessed by IRC were consistent with the investigator assessment. The response was durable \n\nwith median DoR in the previously-treated population reaching 9.8 months (95% CI, 6.9, 16.0) by \n\ninvestigator assessment. In the first-line population, 68% of patients had not progressed after \n\n9 months. The median DoR and PFS were not yet estimable (Table 14). \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTable 14 Summary of efficacy in the combination treatment cohorts based on investigator \n\nand independent radiology review \n\n \n\nEndpoint Analysis Combination 1st Line \n\nN=361 \n\nCombination 2nd Line Plus \n\nN=571 \n\nOverall confirmed \n\nresponse n (%) \n\n(95% CI) \n\nBy Investigator \n\n \n\nBy IRC \n\n22 (61.1%) \n\n(43.5, 76.9) \n\n22 (61.1%) \n\n(43.5, 76.9) \n\n38 (66.7%) \n\n(52.9, 78.6) \n\n36 (63.2%) \n\n(49.3, 75.6) \n\nMedian DoR \n\nMonths (95% CI) \n\nBy Investigator \n\nBy IRC \n\nNE2 (8.3, NE) \n\nNE (6.9, NE) \n\n9.8 (6.9, 16.0) \n\n12.6 (5.8, NE) \n\nMedian PFS \n\nMonths (95% CI) \n\nBy Investigator \n\nBy IRC \n\n-3 \n\n-3 \n\n10.2 (6.9, 16.7) \n\n8.6 (5.2, 16.8) \n\nMedian OS \n\nMonths (95% CI) \n\n- 24.6 (11.7, NE)4 18.2 (14.3, NE) \n\n1 Data cut-off: 8th August 2016 \n2 NE: Not Evaluable \n3 Median PFS currently not estimable \n4 Event rate for OS calculation was 28% and hence the defined median value still needs to mature \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ntrametinib in all subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma and malignant neoplasms \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTrametinib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak concentrations of 1.5 hours post-dose. \n\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of a single 2 mg tablet dose is 72% relative to an intravenous (IV) \n\nmicrodose. The increase in exposure (Cmax and AUC) was dose-proportional following repeat dosing. \n\nFollowing administration of 2 mg once daily, steady-state geometric mean Cmax, AUC(0-) and predose \n\nconcentration were 22.2 ng/ml, 370 ng*hr/ml and 12.1 ng/ml, respectively with a low peak:trough \n\nratio (1.8). Inter-subject variability at steady state was low (<28%). \n\n \n\nTrametinib accumulates with repeat daily dosing with a mean accumulation ratio of 6.0 at 2 mg once \n\ndaily dose. Steady state was achieved by Day 15. \n\n \n\nAdministration of a single dose of trametinib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal resulted in a 70% and \n\n10% decrease in Cmax and AUC, respectively compared to fasted conditions (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBinding of trametinib to human plasma proteins is 97.4%. Trametinib has a volume of distribution of \n\napproximately 1200 L determined following administration of a 5 g intravenous microdose. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that trametinib is metabolised predominantly via \n\ndeacetylation alone or in combination with mono-oxygenation. The deacetylated metabolite was \n\nfurther metabolised by glucuronidation. CYP3A4 oxidation is considered a minor pathway of \n\nmetabolism. The deacetylation is mediated by the carboxyl-esterases 1b, 1c and 2, with possible \n\ncontributions by other hydrolytic enzymes. \n\n \n\nFollowing single and repeated doses of trametinib, trametinib as parent is the main circulating \n\ncomponent in plasma. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nMean terminal half-life is 127 hours (5.3 days) after single dose administration. Trametinib plasma IV \n\nclearance is 3.21 L/hr. \n\n \n\nTotal dose recovery was low after a 10-day collection period (<50%) following administration of a \n\nsingle oral dose of radiolabelled trametinib as a solution, due to the long elimination half-life. \n\nDrug-related material was excreted predominantly in the faeces (>80% of recovered radioactivity) and \n\nto a minor extent in urine (≤19%). Less than 0.1% of the excreted dose was recovered as parent in \n\nurine. \n\n \n\nSpecial patient populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that mildly elevated bilirubin and/or AST levels \n\n(based on National Cancer Institute [NCI] classification) do not significantly affect trametinib oral \n\nclearance. No data are available in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. As \n\nmetabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes of elimination of trametinib, administration of \n\ntrametinib should be undertaken with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nRenal impairment is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on trametinib pharmacokinetics given \n\nthe low renal excretion of trametinib. The pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterised in \n\n223 patients enrolled in clinical trials with trametinib who had mild renal impairment and 35 patients \n\nwith moderate renal impairment using a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Mild and moderate \n\nrenal impairment had no effect on trametinib exposure (<6% for either group). No data are available in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis (range 19 to 92 years), age had no relevant clinical \n\neffect on trametinib pharmacokinetics. Safety data in patients ≥75 years is limited (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRace \n\n \n\nThere are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on trametinib pharmacokinetics as \n\nclinical experience is limited to Caucasians. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in paediatric \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nBody weight and gender \n\n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender and body weight were found to influence \n\ntrametinib oral clearance. Although smaller female subjects are predicted to have higher exposure than \n\nheavier male subjects, these differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment \n\nis warranted. \n\n \n\nMedicinal product interactions \n\n \n\nEffects of trametinib on drug-metabolising enzymes and transporters: In vitro and in vivo data suggest \n\nthat trametinib is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products. Based on in \n\nvitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. \n\nTrametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, an inducer of \n\nCYP3A4 and an inhibitor of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nP-gp and BCRP. However, based on the low dose and low clinical systemic exposure relative to the in \n\nvitro potency of inhibition or induction values, trametinib is not considered to be an in vivo inhibitor or \n\ninducer of these enzymes or transporters, although transient inhibition of BCRP substrates in the gut \n\nmay occur (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nEffects of other drugs on trametinib: In vivo and in vitro data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of \n\ntrametinib are unlikely to be affected by other medicinal products. Trametinib is not a substrate of \n\nCYP enzymes or of the transporters BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, MRP2, and \n\nMATE1. Trametinib is an in vitro substrate of BSEP and the efflux transporter P-gp. Although \n\ntrametinib exposure is unlikely to be affected by inhibition of BSEP, increased levels of trametinib \n\nupon strong inhibition of hepatic P-gp cannot be excluded (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies with trametinib have not been conducted. Trametinib was not genotoxic in \n\nstudies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells and \n\nmicronuclei in the bone marrow of rats. \n\n \n\nTrametinib may impair female fertility in humans, as in repeat-dose studies, increases in cystic \n\nfollicles and decreases in corpora lutea were observed in female rats at exposures below the human \n\nclinical exposure based on AUC. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, in juvenile rats given trametinib, decreased ovarian weights, slight delays in hallmarks of \n\nfemale sexual maturation (vaginal opening and increased incidence of prominent terminal end buds \n\nwithin the mammary gland) and slight hypertrophy of the surface epithelium of the uterus were \n\nobserved. All of these effects were reversible following an off-treatment period and attributable to \n\npharmacology. However, in rat and dog toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in duration, there were no \n\ntreatment effects observed in male reproductive tissues. \n\n \n\nIn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, trametinib induced maternal and \n\ndevelopmental toxicity. In rats decreased foetal weights and increased post-implantation loss were \n\nseen at exposures below or slightly above the clinical exposures based on AUC. In an embryo-foetal \n\ndevelopmental toxicity study with rabbits, decreased foetal body weight, increased abortions, \n\nincreased incidence of incomplete ossification and skeletal malformations were seen at sub-clinical \n\nexposures based on AUC). \n\n \n\nIn repeat-dose studies the effects seen after trametinib exposure are found mainly in the skin, \n\ngastrointestinal tract, haematological system, bone and liver. Most of the findings are reversible after \n\ndrug-free recovery. In rats, hepatocellular necrosis and transaminase elevations were seen after \n\n8 weeks at ≥0.062 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nIn mice, lower heart rate, heart weight and left ventricular function were observed without cardiac \n\nhistopathology after 3 weeks at ≥0.25 mg/kg/day trametinib (approximately 3 times human clinical \n\nexposure based on AUC) for up to 3 weeks. In adult rats, mineralisation of multiple organs was \n\nassociated with increased serum phosphorus and was closely associated with necrosis in heart, liver \n\nand kidney and haemorrhage in the lung at exposures comparable to the human clinical exposure. In \n\nrats, hypertrophy of the physis and increased bone turnover were observed, but the physeal \n\nhypertrophy is not expected to be clinically relevant for adult humans. In rats and dogs given \n\ntrametinib at or below clinical exposures, bone marrow necrosis, lymphoid atrophy in thymus and \n\nGALT and lymphoid necrosis in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus were observed, which have the \n\npotential to impair immune function. In juvenile rats, increased heart weight with no histopathology \n\nwas observed at 0.35 mg/kg/day (approximately twice the adult human clinical exposure based on \n\nAUC). \n\n \n\nTrametinib was phototoxic in an in vitro mouse fibroblast 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay at \n\nsignificantly higher concentrations than clinical exposures (IC50 at 2.92 µg/ml, ≥130 times the clinical \n\nexposure based on Cmax), indicating that there is low risk for phototoxicity to patients taking \n\ntrametinib. \n\n \n\nCombination with dabrafenib \n\n \n\nIn a study in dogs in which trametinib and dabrafenib were given in combination for 4 weeks, signs of \n\ngastro-intestinal toxicity and decreased lymphoid cellularity of the thymus were observed at lower \n\nexposures than in dogs given trametinib alone. Otherwise, similar toxicities were observed as in \n\ncomparable monotherapy studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n6.

What Mekinist is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nMekinist is a medicine that contains the active substance trametinib. It is used either on its own or in \n\ncombination with another medicine containing dabrafenib to treat a type of skin cancer called \n\nmelanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. \n\n \n\nMekinist in combination with dabrafenib is also used to prevent melanoma from coming back after it \n\nhas been removed by surgery. \n\n \n\nMekinist in combination with dabrafenib is also used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small \n\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC). \n\n \n\nBoth cancers have a particular change (mutation) in a gene called BRAF at the V600 position. This \n\nmutation in the gene may have caused the cancer to develop. Your medicine targets proteins made \n\nfrom this mutated gene and slows down or stops the development of your cancer. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Mekinist \n \n\nMekinist should only be used to treat melanomas and NSCLC with the BRAF mutation. Therefore, \n\nbefore starting treatment your doctor will test for this mutation. \n\n \n\nIf your doctor decides that you will receive treatment with the combination of Mekinist and \n\ndabrafenib, read the dabrafenib leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nDo not take Mekinist: \n\n if you are allergic to trametinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\nCheck with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking your medicine.
