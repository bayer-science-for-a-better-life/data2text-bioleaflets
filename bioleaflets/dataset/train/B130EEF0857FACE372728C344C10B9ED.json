PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nModified-release tablet (tablet).\n\nQtrilmet 850 mg/2.5 mg/5 mg modified-release tablets\n\nBeige, biconvex, 11 x 21 mm oval tablet, with 3005 debossed on one side.\n\nQtrilmet 1,000 mg/2.5 mg/5 mg modified-release tablets\n\nGreen, biconvex, 11 x 21 mm oval tablet, with 3002 debossed on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nQtrilmet is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus:\n\n- to improve glycaemic control when metformin with or without sulphonylurea (SU) and either\nsaxagliptin or dapagliflozin does not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n- when already being treated with metformin and saxagliptin and dapagliflozin.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nEach tablet contains a fixed dose of metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin (see section 2). If no \nadequate strength of Qtrilmet is available, individual mono-components should be used instead of the \nmodified-release combination.\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose of Qtrilmet is metformin 2,000 mg/saxagliptin \n5 mg/dapagliflozin 10 mg.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on dual combination with either saxagliptin or dapagliflozin and \nmetformin\nPatients should receive a total daily dose of Qtrilmet equivalent to saxagliptin 5 mg, dapagliflozin \n10 mg, plus the total daily dose of metformin, or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose, already \nbeing taken. The dose should be taken as two tablets orally, once daily at the same time of the day, \nwith food. \n\nSwitching from separate tablets of metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin\nPatients switching from separate tablets of metformin, saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg to \nQtrilmet should receive the same daily dose of metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin already being \ntaken or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin. The dose should be taken as two \ntablets orally, once daily at the same time of the day, with food. \n\nSwitching from metformin immediate-release to metformin modified-release\nIn patients switching from metformin immediate-release to metformin modified-release, the dose of \nQtrilmet should provide metformin at the dose already being taken, or the nearest therapeutically \nappropriate dose (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nMissed doses\nIf a daily dose is missed and it is \u2265 12 hours until the next dose, the dose should be taken. If a daily \ndose is missed and it is < 12 hours until the next dose, the missed dose should be skipped and the next \ndose taken at the usual time.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nBecause elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) are more likely to have decreased renal function, this medicinal \nproduct should be used with caution as age increases. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid \nin prevention of metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in elderly patients (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). Risk of volume depletion with this medicinal product should also be taken into account (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the limited therapeutic experience with this medicinal product in patients \n75 years and older, initiation of therapy is not recommended in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for Qtrilmet in patients with mild renal impairment, \nGFR 60-89 mL/min.\n\nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing medicinal products \nand at least annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment \nand in the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months.\n\nThis medicinal product should not be used in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment \n(patients with GFR < 60 mL/min (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). This medicinal product is \ncontraindicated in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThis medicinal product must not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of this medicinal product in children and adolescents aged 0 to < 18 years have \nnot yet been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\n\n\n4\n\nQtrilmet dose is taken orally once daily at the same time of the day with food to reduce the \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with metformin. Each tablet is to be swallowed whole.\n\nOccasionally, the inactive ingredients of this medicine will be eliminated in the faeces as a soft, \nhydrated mass that may resemble the original tablet.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nQtrilmet is contraindicated in patients with:\n- hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, history \n\nof a serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and\nangioedema, to any dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or to any sodium-glucose \nco-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1);\n\n- any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis) (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8);\n\n- diabetic pre-coma (see section 4.4);\n- severe renal failure (GFR < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2);\n- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as:\n\no dehydration,\no severe infection,\no shock;\n\n- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as:\no cardiac or respiratory failure,\no recent myocardial infarction,\no shock;\n\n- hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2);\n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nLactic acidosis\n\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening of \nrenal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. \n\nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), Qtrilmet should be \ntemporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.\n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as anti-hypertensives, diuretics, and \nNSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic \nacidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, \nprolonged fasting, and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts that may cause lactic acidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed on the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia, and hypothermia \nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking Qtrilmet and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/L, and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.\n\n\n\n5\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\n\nRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been \nreported in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. In a number of cases, the \npresentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below \n14 mmol/litres. It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of dapagliflozin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms, such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue, or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with Qtrilmet should be discontinued \nimmediately.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with Qtrilmet may be restarted when the ketone \nvalues are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating Qtrilmet, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should be \nconsidered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or patients \nwith a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or severe \ndehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery, or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients. \n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nThe safety and efficacy in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and Qtrilmet should \nnot be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes mellitus studies with dapagliflozin, \nDKA was reported with common frequency. \n\nMonitoring of renal function\n\nThe efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in patients who \nhave moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2). In subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment (patients with GFR < 60 mL/min), a \nhigher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of increase in creatinine, \nphosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and hypotension, compared with placebo. Therefore, \nQtrilmet should not be used in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (patients with \nGFR < 60 mL/min). This medicinal product has not been studied in severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\nMetformin is excreted by the kidney, and moderate to severe renal insufficiency increases the risk of \nlactic acidosis (see section 4.4). \n\nRenal function should be assessed:\n- prior to initiation of this medicinal product and regularly thereafter (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2);\n- prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and \n\nperiodically thereafter (see section 4.5);\n\n\n\n6\n\n- for renal function with GFR levels approaching moderate renal impairment and in elderly \npatients, at least 2 to 4 times per year. If renal function falls below GFR < 60 mL/min, treatment \nshould be discontinued.\n\nMetformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR of < 30 mL/min and this treatment should be \ntemporarily interrupted in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3).\n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nanti-hypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with a NSAID.\n\nUse in patients at risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and/or electrolyte imbalances\n\nDue to dapagliflozin\u2019s mechanism of action, Qtrilmet increases diuresis associated with a modest \ndecrease in blood pressure (see section 5.1), which may be more pronounced in patients with very high \nblood glucose concentrations.\n\nThis medicinal product is not recommended for use in patients at risk of volume depletion (e.g.\nreceiving loop diuretics) (see section 4.5) or who are volume depleted, e.g. due to acute illness (such as \nacute gastrointestinal illness with nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea).\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could \npose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy \nwith a history of hypotension or elderly patients.\n\nFor patients receiving Qtrilmet, in case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion, \ncareful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, \nlaboratory tests, including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended. Temporary interruption of \ntreatment with this medicinal product is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until \nthe depletion is corrected (see section 4.8).\n\nAcute pancreatitis\n\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis; persistent, severe abdominal \npain. If pancreatitis is suspected, this medicinal product should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is \nconfirmed, it should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of \npancreatitis.\n\nIn post-marketing experience of saxagliptin, there have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions \nof acute pancreatitis.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\n\nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene) have \nbeen reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (see section 4.8). This is a rare but \nserious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic \ntreatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene is suspected, Qtrilmet should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics and \nsurgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\n\n\n7\n\nDuring post-marketing experience with saxagliptin, including spontaneous reports and clinical trials,\nthe following adverse reactions have been reported with the use of saxagliptin: serious\nhypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and angioedema. \nQtrilmet should be discontinued if a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. The event should \nbe assessed and alternative treatment for diabetes should be instituted (see section 4.8).\n\nUrinary tract infections\n\nTreatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections (see section 4.8). \nPatients with signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections should be evaluated and promptly treated, \nif indicated.\n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and \npyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors.\nTemporary interruption of treatment should be considered when treating pyelonephritis or urosepsis.\n\nElderly\n\nElderly patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, and may be at a greater risk for \nvolume depletion. In addition, elderly patients are more likely to be treated with anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products that may cause volume depletion and/or changes in renal function [e.g.\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB)]. \nTherefore, renal function and risk of volume depletion should be taken into account prior to starting \ntreatment with Qtrilmet. The same recommendations for monitoring of renal function apply to elderly \npatients as to all patients (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nIn subjects \u2265 65 years of age, a higher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse \nreactions related to volume depletion and renal impairment or failure compared with placebo (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nSkin disorders\n\nUlcerative and necrotic skin lesions have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-clinical \ntoxicology studies with saxagliptin (see section 5.3). Skin lesions were not observed at an increased \nincidence in saxagliptin clinical trials. Post-marketing reports of rash have been described in the DPP-4 \ninhibitor class. Rash is also noted as an adverse reaction for this medicinal product (see section 4.8).\nTherefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, such as\nblistering, ulceration, or rash, is recommended.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\n\nPostmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP4 \ninhibitor use, including saxagliptin. In reported cases, patients typically responded to topical or \nsystemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP4 inhibitor. If a patient develops \nblisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin and bullous pemphigoid is suspected, this medicinal \nproduct should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and \nappropriate treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nCardiac failure\n\nExperience in NYHA class I-II is limited in dapagliflozin. There is no experience in clinical trials with \ndapagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. Experience in NYHA class III-IV is limited with saxagliptin.\n\nIn the SAVOR trial, a small increase in the rate for hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the \nsaxagliptin-treated patients compared to placebo, although a causal relationship has not been \nestablished (see section 5.1). Additional analysis did not indicate a differential effect among NYHA\nclasses.\n\n\n\n8\n\nCaution is warranted if Qtrilmet is used in patients who have known risk factors for hospitalisation for \nheart failure, such as a history of heart failure or moderate to severe renal impairment. Patients should \nbe advised of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms.\n\nArthralgia\n\nJoint pain, which may be severe, has been reported in post-marketing reports for DPP-4 inhibitors (see \nsection 4.8). Patients experienced relief of symptoms after discontinuation of the medicinal product and \nsome experienced recurrence of symptoms with reintroduction of the same or another DPP-4 inhibitor. \nOnset of symptoms following initiation of therapy may be rapid or may occur after longer periods of \ntreatment. If a patient presents with severe joint pain, continuation of therapy should be individually \nassessed.\n\nImmunocompromised patients\n\nImmunocompromised patients, such as patients who have undergone organ transplantation or patients \ndiagnosed with human immunodeficiency syndrome have not been studied in the saxagliptin clinical \nprogramme. The efficacy and safety profiles of Qtrilmet in these patients have not been established.\n\nLower limb amputations\n\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term, clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot care.\n\nUse with insulin or insulin secretagogues known to cause hypoglycaemia\n\nBoth saxagliptin and dapagliflozin can individually increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when combined \nwith insulin or an insulin secretagogue (sulphonylurea). Hypoglycaemia does not occur in patients \nreceiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use but could occur during concomitant use \nwith other glucose-lowering agents. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be \nrequired to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when these agents are used in combination with Qtrilmet\n(see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nSurgery\n\nQtrilmet must be discontinued at the time of surgery with general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. \nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition and \nprovided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\n\nAdministration of iodinated contrast agents\n\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Qtrilmet should be \ndiscontinued prior to, or at the time of, the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.5).\n\nElevated haematocrit\n\nHaematocrit increase was observed with dapagliflozin treatment, (see section 4.8); therefore, caution in \npatients with already elevated haematocrit is warranted.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\n\n\n\n9\n\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking dapagliflozin will test positive for glucose in their \nurine.\n\nUse in patients treated with pioglitazone\n\nWhile a causal relationship between dapagliflozin and bladder cancer is unlikely (see sections 4.8 and \n5.3), as a precautionary measure, Qtrilmet is not recommended for use in patients concomitantly \ntreated with pioglitazone. Available epidemiological data for pioglitazone suggest a small increased \nrisk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone.\n\nUse with potent CYP3A4 inducers\n\nUsing CYP3A4 inducers like glucocorticoids, beta-2 agonists, diuretics, carbamazepine, \ndexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampicin may reduce the glycaemic lowering effect of\nQtrilmet. Glycaemic control should be assessed, especially at the beginning, when it is used \nconcomitantly with a potent CYP3A4/5 inducer (see section 4.5).\n\nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\n\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative \nmethods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.\n\nLactose\n\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\nSodium content\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have been performed with the individual active substances of Qtrilmet.\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\nAlcohol\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment due to the metformin active substance of this medicinal \nproduct (see section 4.4). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be \navoided.\n\nIodinated contrast agents\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Qtrilmet must be \ndiscontinued prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4).\n\nCombinations requiring precautions for use\nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta-2 agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products, and observed for loss \n\n\n\n10\n\nof blood glucose control or hypoglycaemia. If necessary, the dose of the glucose-lowering medicinal \nproduct should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.\n\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \nproducts in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.\n\nDiuretics\nDapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of \ndehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nUse with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia\nSaxagliptin and dapagliflozin can individually increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when combined with \ninsulin or an insulin secretagogue. Hypoglycaemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin \nalone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur during concomitant use with other glucose-\nlowering agents. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia when these agents are used in combination with Qtrilmet (see sections 4.4\nand 4.8).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nMetformin\nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.\n\nSaxagliptin\nThe metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). \n\nDapagliflozin\nThe metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by uridine \ndiphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9).\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on metformin, saxagliptin or dapagliflozin\n\nMetformin\nNo clinically relevant interaction has been identified.\n\nSaxagliptin\nThe coadministration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin (such as \ncarbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) has not been studied and may result in \ndecreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. \nGlycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent \nCYP3A4/5 inducer.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin reduced Cmax\nand AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the \nplasma DPP-4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 diltiazem, \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 63% and 2.1-fold, respectively, and the corresponding \n\nvalues for the active metabolite were decreased by 44% and 34%, respectively. These pharmacokinetic \neffects are not clinically meaningful and do not require dose adjustment.\n\nConcomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5-fold, respectively, and the corresponding \n\nvalues for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. These pharmacokinetic \n\n\n\n11\n\neffects are not clinically meaningful and do not require dose adjustment.\n\nIn studies conducted in healthy subjects, neither the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin nor its major\nmetabolite were meaningfully altered by dapagliflozin, metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone,\ndigoxin, diltiazem, simvastatin, omeprazole, antacids or famotidine.\n\nDapagliflozin\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of uridine 5\u2019-diphospho-\nglucuronosyl transferase [UGT] and CYP3A4/5), a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic \nexposure (AUC) was observed, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose \nexcretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) is not expected.\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT 1A9), a 55%\nincrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on \n24-hour urinary glucose excretion.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin were not meaningfully altered by saxagliptin, metformin, \npioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or \nsimvastatin.\n\nEffect of metformin, saxagliptin or dapagliflozin on other medicinal products\n\nMetformin\nOrganic cation transporters (OCT) \nMetformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2.\n\nCo-administration of metformin with:\n- inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin;\n- inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy of\n\nmetformin;\n- inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, \n\nisavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in \nmetformin plasma concentration;\n\n- inhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efficacy and renal \nelimination of metformin.\n\nCaution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these medicinal \nproducts are co-administered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nSaxagliptin\nSaxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin, metformin, glibenclamide\n(a CYP2C9 substrate), pioglitazone (a CYP2C8 [major] and CYP3A4 [minor] substrate), digoxin (a \nP-gp substrate), simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), the active components of a combined oral \ncontraceptive (ethinylestradiol and norgestimate), diltiazem or ketoconazole.\n\nDapagliflozin\nIn interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, dapagliflozin \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin, metformin, pioglitazone (a CYP2C8 [major] and \nCYP3A4 [minor] substrate), sitagliptin, glimepiride (a CYP2C9 substrate), hydrochlorothiazide, \nbumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P-gp substrate) or warfarin (S-warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the \nanticoagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of dapagliflozin \n20 mg and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in AUC of simvastatin and \n31% increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and simvastatin acid exposures \nare not considered clinically relevant.\n\n\n\n12\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of this medicinal product, or its components (metformin hydrochloride, saxagliptin and\ndapagliflozin) has not been studied in pregnant women. Studies in animals with saxagliptin have shown \nreproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). Studies with dapagliflozin in rats have shown \ntoxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of \nhuman pregnancy (see section 5.3). A limited amount of data from the use of metformin in pregnant \nwomen does not indicate an increased risk of congenital malformations. Animal studies with \nmetformin do not indicate harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic or foetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).\n\nQtrilmet should not be used during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected, treatment with this medicinal \nproduct should be discontinued.\n\nWhen the patient plans to become pregnant, and during pregnancy, it is recommended that diabetes is \nnot treated with this medicinal product, but insulin be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to \nnormal as possible, to reduce the risk of malformations of the foetus associated with abnormal blood \nglucose levels.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nMetformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. It is unknown whether saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and/or their metabolites are excreted in \nhuman milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of saxagliptin and/or metabolite in milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of dapagliflozin/metabolites in \nmilk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in breast-feeding offspring (see section 5.3). \n\nThis medicinal product should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effect of this medicinal product, or its components (metformin hydrochloride, saxagliptin and\ndapagliflozin) on fertility in humans has not been studied. Effects on fertility were observed using \nsaxagliptin in male and female rats at high doses producing overt signs of toxicity (see section 5.3). In \nmale and female rats, dapagliflozin showed no effects on fertility at any dose tested. For metformin, \nstudies in animals have not shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nQtrilmet has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nWhen driving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness has been reported in \nstudies with saxagliptin. In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when this \nmedicinal product is used in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products known to \ncause hypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin and sulphonylureas).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Qtrilmet are upper respiratory tract \ninfections (very common), hypoglycaemia when used with SU (very common), gastrointestinal \nsymptoms (very common) and urinary tract infections (common). Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur \nrarely and lactic acidosis may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n13\n\nThe safety profile of the combined use of metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin is comparable to the \nadverse reactions identified for the respective mono-components.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe safety profile is based on pooled analysis of three placebo controlled phase 3 clinical trials in \n1,169 patients for up to 52 weeks, of which 492 patients received a combination of saxagliptin 5 mg, \ndapagliflozin 10 mg, plus metformin (see section 5.1). Additional safety data include clinical trials, \npost-authorisation safety studies and post-marketing experience with the mono-components. The \nadverse reactions associated with Qtrilmet are presented in Table 1. The adverse reactions are listed by \nsystem organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequency categories were defined according to very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \u02c2 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \u02c2 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (\uf0b3 1/100,000 to < 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).\n\nTable 1.

Consideration of such etiology is \nrecommended if a patient presents with megaloblastic anaemia.\n\nH Reported in the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study in patients with type 2 diabetes. Frequency is \nbased on annual rate.\n\n1 Upper respiratory tract infection includes the following preferred terms: nasopharyngitis, influenza, upper \nrespiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis bacterial, tonsillitis, acute tonsillitis, \nlaryngitis, viral pharyngitis, and viral upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n2 Urinary tract infection includes the following preferred terms: urinary tract infection, Escherichia urinary \ntract infection, pyelonephritis, and prostatitis.\n\n3 Vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infection include the following preferred terms: vulvovaginal \nmycotic infection, balanoposthitis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, and vulvovaginitis.\n\n4 Dyslipidaemia includes the following preferred terms: dyslipidaemia, hyperlipidaemia, \nhypercholesterolaemia, and hypertriglyceridaemia.\n\n5 Polyuria includes the following preferred terms: polyuria, and pollakiuria.\n6 Rash was reported during the postmarketing use of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. Preferred terms reported in \n\ndapagliflozin clinical trials included in order of frequency: rash, rash generalised, rash pruritic, rash macular, \nrash maculo-papular, rash pustular, rash vesicular, and rash erythematous.\n\n\n\n15\n\n7 See section 4.4.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nIn the pooled safety analysis, the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia (all reported events including \nthose with central laboratory FPG \u2264 3.9 mmol/L) was 2.0% in subjects treated with dapagliflozin \n10 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin (combination therapy), 0.6% in the saxagliptin plus \nmetformin group, and 2.3% in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group. \n\nIn a 24-week study comparing the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin with or \nwithout SU, with insulin plus metformin with or without SU, the overall incidence rates for \nhypoglycaemia in patients without a background treatment of SU, were 12.7% for the combination \ncompared to 33.1% for insulin. The overall incidence rates of hypoglycaemia in two 52-week studies \ncomparing the combination therapy to glimepiride (SU) were: for the 1st study, 4.2% for the \ncombination therapy versus 27.9% for glimepiride plus metformin versus 2.9% for dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin; for the 2nd study, 18.5% for the combination therapy versus 43.1% for glimepiride plus \nmetformin.\n\nVolume depletion\n\nIn the pooled safety analysis, events related to volume depletion (hypotension, dehydration, and \nhypovolemia) were reflective of the adverse events with dapagliflozin and were reported in two \nsubjects (0.4%) in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group (serious adverse event \n[SAE] of syncope and an AE of urine output decreased), and 3 subjects (0.9%) in the dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin group (2 AEs of syncope and 1 of hypotension).\n\nDecreased renal function\n\nMetformin/saxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: In the pooled safety analysis for Qtrilmet, the \nincidence of adverse events related to decreased renal function was 2.0% subjects in the saxagliptin \nplus dapagliflozin plus metformin group, 1.8% subjects in the saxagliptin plus metformin group, and \n0.6% subjects in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group. Subjects with adverse events of renal \nimpairment had lower mean eGFR values at baseline of 61.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to \n93.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the overall population. The majority of events were considered non-serious, \nmild or moderate in intensity, and resolved. The change in mean eGFR from baseline at week 24 \nwas -1.17 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group, -0.46 \nmL/min/1.73 m2 in saxagliptin plus metformin, and 0.81 mL/min/1.73 m2 in dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin.\n\nDapagliflozin: Adverse reactions related to increased creatinine have been reported for dapagliflozin as \na mono-component. The increases in creatinine were generally transient during continuous treatment or \nreversible after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nVulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections\n\nThe reported adverse reactions of vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections from pooled \nsafety analysis were reflective of the safety profile of dapagliflozin. Adverse reactions of genital \ninfection were reported in 3.0% in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group, 0.9% of \nsaxagliptin plus metformin group and 5.9% of subjects in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group. The \nmajority of the genital infection adverse reactions were reported in females (84% of subjects with a \ngenital infection), were mild or moderate in intensity, of single occurrence, and most patients continued\non therapy.\n\n\n\n16\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\n\nCases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene have been reported post-marketing in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, \nincluding dapagliflozin (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study with 17,160 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and a \nmedian exposure time of 48 months, a total of 6 cases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene were reported, one in the \ndapagliflozin-treated group and 5 in the placebo group.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, with a median exposure time of 48 months, events \nof DKA were reported in 27 patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients in the placebo \ngroup. The events occurred evenly distributed over the study period. Of the 27 patients with DKA \nevents in the dapagliflozin group, 22 had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the event. \nPrecipitating factors for DKA were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nUrinary tract infections\n\nIn the pooled safety analysis, urinary tract infections (UTIs) were balanced across the 3 treatment \ngroups: 5.7% in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin group, 7.4% in the saxagliptin plus \nmetformin group, and 5.6% in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group. One patient in the saxagliptin \nplus dapagliflozin plus metformin group experienced an SAE of pyelonephritis and discontinued \ntreatment. The majority of the urinary tract infections were reported in females (81% of subjects with \nUTI), were mild or moderate in intensity, of single occurrence, and most patients continued on therapy.\n\nMalignancies\n\nSaxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination: Malignant and unspecified neoplasms were reported in \n3 subjects included in the pooled safety analysis. They included adverse events of gastric neoplasm, \npancreatic cancer with hepatic metastases, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the saxagliptin plus \ndapagliflozin plus metformin group. Considering the short latency between first drug exposure and \ntumour diagnosis, a causal relationship to any specific tumour type is considered unlikely.\n\nDapagliflozin: In the 21-study active- and placebo-controlled pool, the overall proportion of subjects \nwith malignant or unspecified tumours was similar between those treated with dapagliflozin (1.50%) \nand placebo/comparator (1.50%), and there was no carcinogenicity or mutagenicity signal in animal \ndata (see section 5.3). When considering the cases of tumours occurring in the different organ systems, \nthe relative risk associated with dapagliflozin was above 1 for some tumours (bladder, prostate, breast) \nand below 1 for others (e.g. blood and lymphatic, ovary, renal tract), not resulting in an overall \nincreased tumour risk associated with dapagliflozin. The increased/decreased risk was not statistically \nsignificant in any of the organ systems. Considering the lack of tumour findings in non-clinical studies \nas well as the short latency between first drug exposure and tumour diagnosis, a causal relationship is \nconsidered unlikely. The numerical imbalance of breast, bladder, and prostate tumours must be \nconsidered with caution; it will be further investigated in post-authorisation studies.\n\nLaboratory findings\n\nDecrease in lymphocyte counts\nSaxagliptin: Across clinical studies in the saxagliptin programme a small decrease in absolute \nlymphocyte count was observed, approximately 100 cells/microL relative to placebo. Mean absolute \nlymphocyte counts remained stable with daily dosing up to 102 weeks in duration. This decrease in \nmean absolute lymphocyte count was not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions.\n\nLipids\n\n\n\n17\n\nData from the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment arms of the three individual \nstudies included in the pooled analysis, demonstrated trends of mean percent increases from baseline\n(rounded to the nearest tenth) in total cholesterol (Total C), (ranging from 0.4% to 3.8%), LDL-C\n(ranging from 2.1% to 6.9%), and HDL-C (ranging 2.3% to 5.2%) along with mean percent decreases \nfrom baseline in triglycerides (ranging from -3.0% to -10.8%).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nOf the 1,169 subjects treated in the pooled safety data from the 3 clinical trials, 1,007 subjects (86.1%) \nwere aged < 65 years, 162 subjects (13.9%) were aged \u2265 65 years and 9 subjects (0.8%) were aged \n\u2265 75 years. Generally, the most common adverse events reported in \u2265 65 years old were similar to \n< 65 years old. Therapeutic experience in patients 65 years and older is limited, and very limited in \npatients 75 years and older.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the \npatient\u2019s clinical status. Saxagliptin and its major metabolite are removed by haemodialysis (23% of \ndose over four hours). The removal of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. High \noverdose or concomitant risks of metformin may lead to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a medical \nemergency and must be treated in a hospital. The most effective method to remove lactate and \nmetformin is haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD25.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nQtrilmet combines three anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products with different and complementary\nmechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: metformin \nhydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class, saxagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and dapagliflozin, a\nSGLT2 inhibitor.\n\nMetformin is a biguanide with anti-hyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore, does not produce hypoglycaemia.\nMetformin may act via three mechanisms; by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting \ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral \nglucose uptake and utilisation in muscle, and by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. Metformin \nstimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin increases the \ntransport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4).\n\n\n\n18\n\nSaxagliptin is a highly potent (Ki: 1.3 nM), selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of DPP-4, an \nenzyme responsible for the breakdown of incretin hormones. This results in a glucose-dependent \nincrease in insulin secretion, thus reducing fasting and post-prandial blood glucose concentrations.\n\nDapagliflozin is a highly potent (Ki: 0.55 nM), selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose \n\nco-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Dapagliflozin blocks reabsorption of filtered glucose from the S1 segment \nof the renal tubule, effectively lowering blood glucose in a glucose dependent and insulin-independent \nmanner. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by reducing renal\nglucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. The increased urinary glucose excretion with \nSGLT2 inhibition produces an osmotic diuresis, and can result in a reduction in systolic BP.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe safety and efficacy of the fixed-dose combination of metformin/saxagliptin/dapagliflozin was \nevaluated in five randomised, double-blind, active/placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus. Two add-on therapy trials, which added either dapagliflozin to \nsaxagliptin plus metformin or saxagliptin to dapagliflozin plus metformin, were conducted for \n24 weeks followed by a 28-week extension treatment period. In one trial conducted for 24 weeks,\nsaxagliptin and dapagliflozin added to metformin was compared to saxagliptin or dapagliflozin added \nto metformin. In one of two supportive studies, therapy with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin was \ncompared to glimepiride in patients inadequately controlled on metformin. The other study compared \ntherapy with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin to insulin glargine in patients inadequately controlled on \nmetformin with or without a sulphonylurea.\n\nGlycaemic control\n\nAdd-on therapy with dapagliflozin in patients inadequately controlled on saxagliptin plus metformin\n\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 28-week extension compared \nthe sequential addition of 10 mg dapagliflozin to 5 mg saxagliptin and metformin to the addition of \nplacebo to 5 mg saxagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \nand inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c \u2265 7% and \u2264 10.5%). Three hundred twenty (320) patients\nwere randomised equally into either the dapagliflozin added to saxagliptin plus metformin treatment \ngroup or placebo plus saxagliptin plus metformin treatment group. The treatment groups were \nproportionally well balanced with regard to demographics, subject characteristics, disease \ncharacteristics, and medical history. The mean age was 55.1 years and 54.4% of patients were female. \nThe mean duration of T2DM when entering the study was 7.6 years, mean baseline HbA1c of 8.2%. \nAll patients had been on a stable dose of metformin (1,500 mg or greater per day) for at least 8 weeks \nprior to screening visit. 101 patients were on a maximum dose of DPP4 inhibitor for at least 8 weeks \nbefore the screening visit and then switched to saxagliptin 5 mg for 8 weeks ahead of the study start. \nThe remaining 219 patients started to take 5 mg saxagliptin 16 weeks ahead of the study start.\n\nThe group with dapagliflozin sequentially added to saxagliptin and metformin achieved statistically \nsignificant (p-value < 0.0001) greater reductions in HbA1c versus the group with placebo sequentially\nadded to saxagliptin plus metformin group at 24 weeks (see Table 2). The effect in HbA1c observed at \nweek 24 was sustained at week 52. The adjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c for the \ndapagliflozin and saxagliptin plus metformin and placebo and saxagliptin plus metformin groups were \n-0.74% (95% CI: -0.90, -0.57) and 0.07% (95% CI: -0.13, 0.27), respectively. The difference in the \nadjusted mean change from baseline to week 52 between the treatment groups \nwas -0.81% (95% CI: -1.06, -0.55).\n\nAdd-on therapy with saxagliptin in patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin plus metformin\n\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c \u2265 7% and \u2264 10.5%) on metformin and \ndapagliflozin alone, compared the sequential addition of 5 mg saxagliptin to 10 mg dapagliflozin and \nmetformin, to the addition of placebo to 10 mg dapagliflozin and metformin. 153 patients were \n\n\n\n19\n\nrandomised into the saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment group, and 162 \npatients were randomised into the placebo added to dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment group. The \ntreatment groups were proportionally well balanced with regard to demographics, subject \ncharacteristics, disease characteristics, and medical history. The mean age was 54.6 years and 52.7% of \npatients were female. The mean duration of T2DM when entering the study was 7.7 years, mean \nbaseline HbA1c of 7.9%. Patients had been on a stable dose of metformin (1,500 mg or greater per \nday) for at least 8 weeks prior to screening visit and were then treated with metformin and \ndapagliflozin 10 mg for 10 weeks ahead of the study start.\n\nThe group with saxagliptin 5 mg sequentially added to dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin achieved \nstatistically significant (p-value < 0.0001) greater reductions in HbA1c versus the group with placebo \nsequentially added to dapagliflozin plus metformin group at 24 weeks (see Table 2). The effect in \nHbA1c observed at week 24 was sustained at week 52. At week 52, adjusted mean changes from \nbaseline in HbA1c in the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin and placebo and dapagliflozin \nplus metformin groups were -0.38% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.22) and 0.05% (95% CI: -0.11, 0.20), \nrespectively. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline to week 52 between the\ntreatment groups was -0.42% [95% CI: -0.64, -0.20].\n\nTable 2.

The treatment groups were proportionally \nwell balanced with regard to demographics, subject characteristics, disease characteristics, and medical \nhistory. The mean age was 53.8 years and 49.8% of patients were female. The mean duration of T2DM \nwhen entering the study was 7.6 years, mean baseline HbA1c of 8.94% and patients had been on a \nstable dose of metformin (1,500 mg or greater per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to the screening visit. \nPatients were randomised to one of three double-blind treatment groups to receive saxagliptin 5 mg and \ndapagliflozin 10 mg added to metformin, saxagliptin 5 mg and placebo added to metformin, or \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo added to metformin.\n\nThe saxagliptin and dapagliflozin group achieved significantly greater reductions in HbA1c versus \neither the saxagliptin group or dapagliflozin group at 24 weeks (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

Patients on \nglimepiride/placebo dose were up-titrated starting at 1 mg per day over 12 weeks to optimal glycaemic \neffect (FPG < 6.1 mmol/L) or the highest tolerable dose. Thereafter, glimepiride/placebo dose were \nkept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycaemia.\n\nAt week 52, the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -1.35% for the saxagliptin 5 mg \nand dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin group (N=218), compared to -0.98% for the glimepiride plus \nmetformin group (N=212) (difference -0.37%, 95% CI [-0.57, -0.18], p < 0.001).\n\nTherapy with saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg in comparison to insulin glargine in patients \ninadequately controlled on metformin with or without a sulphonylurea\n\n\n\n22\n\nA 24-week randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study with a 28-week extension \ncompared orally once daily saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin with or without a \nsulphonylurea to titrated subcutaneous insulin glargine plus metformin with or without a sulphonylurea \nin T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c \u2265 8.0% and \u2264 12.0%). \n\nAt week 24, the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -1.67% for the saxagliptin 5 mg \nand dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin with or without SU group (N=319), which was noninferior to \nthe change of -1.54% in the insulin glargine plus metformin with or without SU group (N=312) \n(difference -0.13%, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.03]).\n\nBody weight\n\nCombination therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to glimepiride in \nT2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone resulted in significant difference \nin mean body weight change at week 52. The adjusted mean change from baseline was -3.11 kg (95% \nCI [-3.65, -2.57]) for the saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin group, and 0.95 kg \n(95% CI [0.38, 1.51]) for the glimepiride plus metformin group. The difference in mean body weight \nbetween treatment groups was -4.06 kg (95% CI [-4.84, -3.28] p < 0.001) at week 52.\n\nThe combination of saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin, with or without a \nsulphonylurea group, compared to treatment with insulin glargine and metformin, with or without a \nSU, resulted in significant difference in body weight change at week 24. The mean change from \nbaseline was -1.50 kg (95% CI [-1.89, -1.11]) for the saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg, plus \nmetformin group, versus 2.14 kg (95% CI [1.75, 2.54]) in the insulin glargine plus metformin group. \nThe difference in mean body weight between treatment groups was -3.64 kg (95% CI [-4.20, -3.09] \np < 0.001).\n\nIn the study of concomitant addition of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, the adjusted mean change from \nbaseline in body weight at week 24 (excluding data after rescue) was -2.05 kg (95% CI [-2.52, -1.58]) \nin the saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin group and -2.39 kg \n(95% CI [-2.87, -1.91]) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin group, while the saxagliptin 5 mg \nplus metformin group had no change (0.00 kg) (95% CI [-0.48, 0.49]). \n\nBlood pressure\n\nIn study MB102129 and study CV181168, treatment with Qtrilmet resulted in change from baseline for \nsystolic blood pressure ranging from -1.3 to -2.2 mmHg and for diastolic blood pressure ranging \nfrom -0.5 to -1.2 mmHg caused by Qtrilmet\u2019s mild diuretic effect. The modest lowering effects on BP \nwere consistent over time and a similar number of patients had systolic BP < 130 mmHg or diastolic \nBP < 80 mmHg at week 24 across the treatment groups.\n\nIn the study comparing concomitant therapy of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin with glimepiride in \npatients inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the decrease in systolic blood pressure at week 52 \nin the saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin group (-2.6 mmHg 95% \nCI [-4.4, -0.8]) was greater than in the glimepiride plus metformin group (1.0 mmHg 95% CI [-0.9, \n2.9]). The difference in mean SBP between treatment groups was -3.6 mmHg (95% CI [-6.3, -1.0] \np = 0.007).\n\nCardiovascular safety\n\nIn the pooled safety analysis, cardiovascular (CV) events that were adjudicated and confirmed as CV \nevents were reported in a total of 1.0% of subjects in the saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin \ngroup, 0.6% in the saxagliptin plus metformin group, and 0.9% in the dapagliflozin plus metformin \ngroup.\n\n\n\n23\n\nMetformin\nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood\nglucose control in type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed:\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np = 0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups (40.1 \nevents/1,000 patient-years), p = 0.0034;\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin 7.5 \nevents/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p = 0.017;\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 13.5 events/1,000 \npatient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, (p = 0.011), and versus the \ncombined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-years\n(p = 0.021);\n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 11 events/1,000 \npatient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p = 0.01).\n\nSaxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus - thrombolysis \nin myocardial infarction (SAVOR) study\nSAVOR was a CV outcome trial in 16,492 patients with HbA1c \u2265 6.5% and < 12% (12,959 with \nestablished CV disease; 3,533 with multiple risk factors only) who were randomised to saxagliptin \n(n=8,280) or placebo (n=8,212) added to regional standards of care for HbA1c and CV risk factors. \nThe study population included those \u2265 65 years (n = 8,561) and \u2265 75 years (n = 2,330), with normal or \nmild renal impairment (n = 13,916) as well as moderate (n = 2,240) or severe (n = 336) renal \nimpairment. \n\nThe primary safety (non-inferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint was a composite endpoint \nconsisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major adverse CV events (MACE): \nCV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal ischemic stroke.\n\nAfter a mean follow up of 2 years, the trial met its primary safety endpoint demonstrating saxagliptin \ndoes not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to placebo when \nadded to current background therapy. \n\nNo benefit was observed for MACE or all-cause mortality.\n\nOne component of the secondary composite endpoint, hospitalisation for heart failure, occurred at a \ngreater rate in the saxagliptin group (3.5%) compared with the placebo group (2.8%), with nominal \nstatistical significance favouring placebo [HR=1.27; (95% CI 1.07, 1.51); P = 0.007]. Clinically \nrelevant factors predictive of increased relative risk with saxagliptin treatment could not be definitively \nidentified. Subjects at higher risk for hospitalisation for heart failure, irrespective of treatment \nassignment, could be identified by known risk factors for heart failure, such as baseline history of heart \nfailure or impaired renal function. However, subjects on saxagliptin with a history of heart failure or \nimpaired renal function at baseline were not at an increased risk relative to placebo for the primary or \nsecondary composite endpoints or all-cause mortality.\n\nAnother secondary endpoint, all-cause mortality, occurred at a rate of 5.1% in the saxagliptin group \nand 4.6% in the placebo group. CV deaths were balanced across the treatment groups. There was a \nnumerical imbalance in non-CV death, with more events on saxagliptin (1.8%) than placebo (1.4%) \n[HR = 1.27; (95% CI 1.00, 1.62); P = 0.051].\n\n\n\n24\n\nDapagliflozin\nA meta-analysis of cardiovascular events in the clinical program was performed. In the clinical \nprogram, 34.4% of subjects had a history of cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension) at \nbaseline and 67.9% had hypertension. The hazard ratio comparing dapagliflozin to comparator\nwas 0.79 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.07), indicating that in this analysis dapagliflozin is not associated \nwith an increase in cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular\ndeath, MI, and stroke were observed with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.10).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nQtrilmet in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nBioequivalence has been confirmed between Qtrilmet tablets and the individual components \n(metformin modified-release, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin) in healthy subjects when administered in \nthe fed state.\n\nAbsorption\n\nMetformin: Following a single oral dose of metformin extended-release tablet, Cmax is achieved with a \nmedian value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. The extent of metformin absorption (as measured \nby AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet increased by approximately 50% when given \nwith food. There was no effect of food on Cmax and Tmax of metformin.\n\nSaxagliptin: Saxagliptin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in the fasted state, with\nmaximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of saxagliptin and its major metabolite attained within 2 and\n4 hours (Tmax), respectively. The Cmax and AUC values of saxagliptin and its major metabolite\nincreased proportionally with the increment in the saxagliptin dose, and this dose-proportionality was\nobserved in doses up to 400 mg. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects,\nthe mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 78 ng h/mL and\n214 ng h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma Cmax values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL,\n\nrespectively. The intra-subject coefficients of variation for saxagliptin Cmax and AUC were less than\n12%.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum \ndapagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in \nthe fasted state. Geometric mean steady-state dapagliflozin Cmax and AUC\u03c4 values following once daily \n10 mg doses of dapagliflozin were 158 ng/mL and 628 ng h/mL, respectively. The absolute oral \nbioavailability of dapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Food has \nrelatively modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. Administration \nwith a high-fat meal decreases dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 50% and prolonged Tmax by approximately \n1 hour, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These changes are not considered to \nbe clinically meaningful.\n\nDistribution\n\nMetformin: Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood \npeak is lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells \nmost likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean Vd ranged between 63-276 L.\n\nSaxagliptin: The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is\nnegligible. Thus, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g. renal or hepatic\nimpairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. The volume of distribution of \nsaxagliptin was 205 L.\n\n\n\n25\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in \nvarious disease states (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution \nof dapagliflozin was 118 L.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetformin: Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in \nhumans.\n\nSaxagliptin: The biotransformation of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 \n(CYP3A4/5). The major active metabolite of saxagliptin, 5-OH-saxagliptin, is also a selective,\nreversible, competitive DPP-4 inhibitor, half as potent as saxagliptin.\n\nIn in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield \ndapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is an inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide or other \nmetabolites do not contribute to the glucose-lowering effects. The formation of \ndapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an enzyme present in the liver and kidney, and \nCYP-mediated metabolism was a minor clearance pathway in humans.\n\nIn in vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. \nTherefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of co-administered medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by these enzymes.\n\nElimination\n\nMetformin: Renal clearance of metformin is > 400 mL/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by \nglomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination \nhalf-life is approximately 6.5 hours.\n\nSaxagliptin: The mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite\nare 2.5 hours and 3.1 hours, respectively, and the mean t1/2 value for plasma DPP-4 inhibition was\n26.9 hours. Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg \ndose of 14C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36% and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its \nactive metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin \n(~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), \nsuggesting some active renal excretion.\n\nDapagliflozin: The mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a \nsingle oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of \ndapagliflozin administered intravenously was 207 mL/min. Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are \nprimarily eliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2% as unchanged dapagliflozin.\n\nLinearity\n\nMetformin: At steady state, the AUC and Cmax are less than dose proportional for metformin \nextended-release within the range of 500 to 2,000 mg administered once daily.\n\nSaxagliptin: The Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin and its major metabolite increased proportionally to the\nsaxagliptin dose. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its major metabolite was \nobserved with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence was \nobserved in the clearance of saxagliptin and its major metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing\nwith saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 400 mg.\n\n\n\n26\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose \nover the range of 0.1 to 500 mg and its pharmacokinetics did not change with time upon repeated daily \ndosing for up to 24 weeks.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\nMetformin: The available data in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency are scarce and no reliable \nestimation of the systemic exposure to metformin in this subgroup as compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function could be made. In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life \nof metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma, (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nSaxagliptin: After a single dose of saxagliptin in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (or ESRD) classified on the basis of creatinine clearance the mean AUC values of \nsaxagliptin were 1.2-, and up to 2.1- and 4.5- fold higher, respectively, than AUC values in subjects \nwith normal renal function. The AUC values of 5-OH-saxagliptin were also increased. The degree of \nrenal impairment did not affect the Cmax of saxagliptin or its major metabolite.\n\nDapagliflozin: At steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), subjects with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol plasma \nclearance) had mean systemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32%, 60% and 87% higher, respectively, \nthan those of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The steady-state 24-hour \nurinary glucose excretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of \nglucose/day was excreted by subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, \nmoderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. The impact of haemodialysis on dapagliflozin \nexposure is not known.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nMetformin hydrochloride: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients \nwith hepatic impairment.\n\nSaxagliptin: In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B) or severe \n(Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment the exposures to saxagliptin were 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.8-fold \nhigher, respectively, and the exposures to BMS-510849 (saxagliptin metabolite) were 22%, 7%,\nand 33% lower, respectively, than those observed in healthy subjects.\n\nDapagliflozin: In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B) \nmean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, compared to \nhealthy matched control subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In \nsubjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin \nwere 40% and 67% higher than matched healthy controls, respectively.\n\nElderly\n\nMetformin hydrochloride: Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in \nhealthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is \nprolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that \nthe change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal \nfunction (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nSaxagliptin: Elderly patients (65\u201380 years) had about 60% higher saxagliptin AUC than young patients \n(18\u201340 years). This is not considered clinically meaningful.\n\n\n\n27\n\nDapagliflozin: There is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects up \nto 70 years old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can be \nexpected. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients > 70 years old.\n\nGender\n\nMetformin hydrochloride: Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between \nnormal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes when analysed according to gender (males=19, \nfemales=16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the anti-\nhyperglycaemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females.\n\nSaxagliptin: Females had approximately 25% higher systemic exposure values for saxagliptin. There \nwere no clinically relevant differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and \nfemales.\n\nDapagliflozin: The mean dapagliflozin AUCss in females was estimated to be about 22% higher than in \nmales.\n\nRace\n\nMetformin hydrochloride: No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have \nbeen performed.\n\nSaxagliptin: Race was not identified as a statistically significant covariate on the apparent clearance of \nsaxagliptin and its metabolite.\n\nDapagliflozin: There were no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposures between White, \nBlack or Asian races.\n\nBody weight\n\nSaxagliptin: Body weight had a small and non-clinically meaningful impact on saxagliptin exposure.\nFemales had approximately 25% higher systemic-exposure values for saxagliptin, this difference is \nconsidered not clinically relevant.\n\nDapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased weight. Consequently, \nlow-weight patients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with high-weight somewhat \ndecreased exposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical studies of either metformin, saxagliptin or dapagliflozin revealed no special hazard for \nhumans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.\n\nSaxagliptin: Saxagliptin produced reversible skin lesions (scabs, ulcerations and necrosis) in\nextremities (tail, digits, scrotum and/or nose) in cynomolgus monkeys. The no observed effect level\n(NOEL) for the lesions is 1 and 2 times the human exposure of saxagliptin and the major metabolite,\nrespectively, at the recommended human dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. The clinical relevance of the skin\nlesions is not known, and skin lesions have not been observed in humans.\n\nImmune related findings of minimal, nonprogressive, lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen, lymph nodes and \nbone marrow with no adverse sequelae have been reported in all species tested at exposures starting\nfrom 7 times the RHD.\n\nSaxagliptin produced gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs, including bloody/mucoid faeces and \nenteropathy at higher doses with a NOEL 4 and 2 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the \nmajor metabolite, respectively, at RHD. The effect on offspring body weights were noted until \n\n\n\n28\n\npostnatal day 92 and 120 in females and males, respectively.\n\nNo non-clinical studies have been conducted in metformin/saxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination.\n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity\n\nMetformin: Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonic or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.\n\nSaxagliptin: Saxagliptin has effects on fertility in male and female rats at high doses producing overt \nsigns of toxicity. Saxagliptin was not teratogenic at any doses evaluated in rats or rabbits. At high \ndoses in rats, saxagliptin caused reduced ossification (a developmental delay) of the foetal pelvis and \ndecreased foetal body weight (in the presence of maternal toxicity), with a NOEL 303 and 30 times the \nhuman exposure for saxagliptin and the major metabolite, respectively, at RHD. In rabbits, the effects \nof saxagliptin were limited to minor skeletal variations observed only at maternally toxic doses (NOEL \n158 and 224 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the major metabolite, respectively, at\nRHD). In a pre- and postnatal developmental study in rats, saxagliptin caused decreased pup weight at \nmaternally toxic doses, with NOEL 488 and 45 times the human exposure for saxagliptin and the major \nmetabolite, respectively, at RHD. The effect on offspring body weights were noted until postnatal day \n92 and 120 in females and males, respectively.\n\nDapagliflozin: Direct administration of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and indirect exposure \nduring late pregnancy (corresponding to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with respect to \nhuman renal maturation) and lactation are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of \nrenal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny.\n\nIn a juvenile study, when dapagliflozin was dosed directly to young rats from postnatal day 21 until \npostnatal day 90, renal pelvic and tubular dilatations (with dose-related increases in kidney weight and \nmacroscopic kidney enlargement) were reported at all dose levels; pup exposures at the lowest dose \ntested were \u2265 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. The renal pelvic and tubular \ndilatations observed in juvenile animals did not fully reverse within the approximate 1-month recovery \nperiod.\n\nDapagliflozin dosed to maternal rats from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 21, and pups were \nindirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. Increased incidence or severity of renal pelvic \ndilatation was observed in adult offspring of treated dams, although only at the highest dose tested (at \nmaternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures of 1,415 times and 137 times, respectively, the human values \nat the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Additional developmental toxicity was limited \nto dose-related reductions in pup body weights, and observed only at doses \u2265 15 mg/kg/day (pup \nexposures \u2265 29 times the human values at the MRHD). Maternal toxicity was evident only at the \nhighest dose tested, and limited to transient reductions in body weight and food consumption at dose. \nThe NOAEL for developmental toxicity is associated with a maternal systemic exposure 19 times the \nhuman values at the MRHD.\n\nIn additional studies of embryo-foetal development in rabbits, dapagliflozin caused neither maternal \nnor developmental toxicities at any dose tested; the highest dose tested corresponded to a systemic \nexposure 1,191 times the MRHD. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at \nexposures up to 1,441 times the human values at the MRHD.\n\n6.

What Qtrilmet is and what it is used for\n\nQtrilmet contains the active substances metformin, saxagliptin, and dapagliflozin. Each belongs to a \ngroup of medicines called \u201coral anti-diabetics\u201d. This medicine is taken by mouth to treat diabetes and\neach of the active substances works in a different way to treat the condition.\n\nThis medicine is for a type of diabetes called \u201ctype 2 diabetes\u201d. If you have type 2 diabetes, your \npancreas does not make enough insulin or your body is not able to use the insulin it produces properly. \nThis leads to a high level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. The three medicines in Qtrilmet lower the \namount of sugar in the blood by causing it to be taken up into cells or passed out of the body in the \nurine.\n\nQtrilmet is only given to adults aged 18 years and older. It is used if other oral diabetes medicines, \nalong with diet and exercise, cannot control your diabetes well enough. It is taken on its own, or it can \nbe combined with a different type of diabetes medicine called a sulphonylurea.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Qtrilmet\n\nDo not take Qtrilmet:\n- if you are allergic to metformin, saxagliptin, dapagliflozin, or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6);\n- if you have had a serious allergic reaction to some other medicines used to control your blood \n\nsugar, namely:\no \u2018gliptins\u2019 (or DPP-4 inhibitors) \u2013 like alogliptin, linagliptin and sitagliptin or,\no \u2018gliflozins\u2019 (or SGLT2 inhibitors) \u2013 like canagliflozin and empagliflozin;\n\n- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with:\no severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood glucose),\no nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss,\no lactic acidosis (see \u201cRisk of lactic acidosis\u201d below),\n\n\n\n48\n\no ketoacidosis, where substances called \u2018ketone bodies\u2019 build up in the blood and which can \nlead to a diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, \nsleepiness, or your breath developing an unusual fruity smell;\n\n- if you have ever had a diabetic coma;\n- if you have severely reduced kidney function;\n- if you have a severe infection;\n- if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration) \u2013 due to long-lasting or severe \n\ndiarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d \nbelow);\n\n- if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your\nblood circulation or difficulties in breathing;\n\n- if you have problems with your liver;\n- if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either every day or only from time to time (please see \n\nsection \u201cQtrilmet with alcohol\u201d).\n\nDo not take Qtrilmet if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before taking Qtrilmet.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Qtrilmet, and during treatment:\n- if you experience vomiting, stomach ache (abdominal pain), muscle cramps, a general feeling of \n\nnot being well with severe tiredness, difficulty breathing, reduced body temperature or slow \nheartbeat. These may be symptoms of a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic \nacidosis which can occur with Qtrilmet, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. \nThe risk of lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, \nprolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems,\nand medical conditions in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as \nacute severe heart disease). Stop taking Qtrilmet and contact a doctor or go to the nearest \nhospital immediately if you experience symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition is a \nmedical emergency that may lead to coma;\n\n- if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, \nfast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, \na sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. These may be \nsymptoms of another rare, but very serious, sometimes life-threatening condition called diabetic \nketoacidosis. With this condition, the levels of substances called \u201cketone bodies\u201d increase in \nyour urine or blood and this can be picked up in tests. The risk of developing diabetic \nketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, \ndehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or major surgery or serious illness (which \nincrease the body\u2019s needs for insulin). Stop taking Qtrilmet and contact a doctor or go to the \nnearest hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of diabetic \nketoacidosis, as this condition is a medical emergency;\n\n- if you lose a lot of body fluids, such as with severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, nausea (feeling \nsick), increased sweating in heat, or if you are not able to eat or drink. Stop taking Qtrilmet for \na short time if you have a condition that leads to dehydration and talk to your doctor about \nwhat to do and when to start taking Qtrilmet again;\n\n- if you have \u201ctype 1 diabetes\u201d. Qtrilmet should not be used to treat this condition;\n\n- if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas;\n\n- if you have reduced kidney function or liver problems;\n\n- if your body\u2019s ability to fight infections (immunity) is reduced, such as with a disease like AIDS \nor from medicines that you take after an organ transplant;\n\n- if you have ever had a serious hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction or your doctors have told you \nthat you may have had one;\n\n- if you have or have had serious heart disease;\n\n\n\n49\n\n- if you have risk factors for developing heart failure, such as problems with your kidneys. Your \ndoctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Symptoms can include \nshortness of breath, rapid increase in weight, and swelling of the ankles or feet (pedal oedema).\nWatch out for these symptoms and call your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse immediately if you get \nany of them;\n\n- if you have or have had low blood pressure (hypotension);\n\n- if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too \nmuch body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed in section 4. Tell your doctor before \nyou start taking Qtrilmet if you have any of these signs;\n\n- if you often get infections of the urinary tract or have a serious infection of the urinary tract, \nincluding urosepsis or pyelonephritis, which can cause fever, chills, burning sensation when \npassing water (urinating), blood in urine, and pain in your back or side. You should call your \ndoctor, pharmacist, or nurse immediately if you experience any of these symptoms;\n\n- if you have severe joint pain;\n\n- if you take pioglitazone to lower your blood sugar, Qtrilmet may not be recommended to use;\n\n- if you take any of the following medicines: glucocorticoids, beta-2 agonists, diuretics, \ncarbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampicin as they may reduce \nthe effect of Qtrilmet (see \u201cOther medicines and Qtrilmet\u201d);\n\n- if you are 75 years old or older;\n\n- if blood tests show that the amount of red blood cells in your blood is too high.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before \ntaking Qtrilmet.\n\nSurgery and operations\nIf you need major surgery, you must stop taking Qtrilmet during and for some time after the operation. \nYour doctor will decide when to stop and when to restart your treatment with Qtrilmet. \n\nDiabetic skin and foot problems\nSkin damage, such as sores or ulcers is a common complication of diabetes. Rash can occur with both \nsaxagliptin and dapagliflozin (see section 4). Follow the recommendations for skin care from your \ndoctor or nurse. Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering of the skin, as it may be a sign for a \ncondition called bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop Qtrilmet.\n\nIt is important to check your feet regularly \u2013 and follow the advice on foot care from your health care \nprofessional.\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u2019s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\nKidney function\nYou should have a blood test to check how well your kidneys are working before you start taking and \nwhile you are on this medicine. Your kidney function will be checked at least once every year or more \nfrequently if you are elderly or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nUrine test\nBecause of how Qtrilmet works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nQtrilmet is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not \nbeen studied in these patients.\n\n\n\n50\n\nOther medicines and Qtrilmet\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. In particular, talk to your doctor before taking Qtrilmet if you are taking any of the \nfollowing medicines:\n\n- medicines to lower blood pressure including ACE inhibitors (such as enalapril or ramipril), \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists (such as losartan or candesartan);\n\n- insulin, sulphonylureas (such as glimepiride) or pioglitazone to lower your blood sugar;\n- medicines that increase urine production and lower blood pressure (diuretics). Your doctor may \n\nask you to stop taking Qtrilmet. Possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed \nin section 4;\n\n- medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have \nreduced kidney function (such as verapamil, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, \nisavuconazole, crizotinib or olaparib);\n\n- if you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances:\no beta-2 agonists \u2013 used to treat asthma,\no carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin \u2013 medicines for preventing fits (seizure) or \n\nsome types of long-term pain,\no cimetidine \u2013 used to treat stomach problems,\no corticosteroids such as dexamethasone \u2013 used to treat inflammation in diseases like \n\nasthma and arthritis,\no diltiazem \u2013 used to treat angina (chest pain) and lower blood pressure,\no ketoconazole tablets \u2013 used to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome (when the body produces an \n\nexcess of cortisol),\no rifampicin \u2013 an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis,\no non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and celecoxib (a \n\n\u2018COX-2-inhibitor\u2019) \u2013 used to treat pain and inflammation.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or if you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking Qtrilmet.\n\nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Qtrilmet before or at the time of the \ninjection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nQtrilmet.\n\nQtrilmet with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Qtrilmet since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis \n(see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d and \u201cDo not take Qtrilmet if you\u201d).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nQtrilmet is not recommended during pregnancy and your doctor will ask you to stop taking this \nmedicine if you become pregnant or plan to have a baby. Talk to your doctor about the best way to \ncontrol your blood sugar while you are pregnant.\n\nYou should not use Qtrilmet if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Metformin passes into \nbreast milk in small amounts. It is not known if saxagliptin and dapagliflozin pass into breast milk.\nTalk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you would like to breast-feed or you are \nbreast-feeding your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nQtrilmet is not expected to affect you being able to drive a car or use any tools or machines. However, \nif you feel dizzy while taking Qtrilmet, do not drive or use tools or machines. Also, it may be \ndangerous to drive or use machines if your blood sugar levels fall too low (hypoglycaemia), which can\ncause shaking, sweating, fast heartbeat, change in vision, headache and confusion.\n\nQtrilmet contains lactose\n\n\n\n51\n\nQtrilmet contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\nSodium content\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019.\n\n3. How to take Qtrilmet\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\nYour doctor will prescribe an appropriate dose of Qtrilmet depending on your blood sugar level and the \ndiabetes medicines you were taking before. The recommended dose is two tablets once a day.\n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose of Qtrilmet is metformin 2,000 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg and \ndapagliflozin 10 mg.\n\nSwitching to Qtrilmet\nIf you are already taking metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin as single tablets or saxagliptin and \ndapagliflozin as a combination together with metformin, your doctor may ask you to switch to this \nmedicine so you only need to take one tablet. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking the separate \ntablets of these medicines as well as Qtrilmet.\n\nTaking this medicine\n- Swallow the tablets whole with half a glass of water.\n- Take your tablets with food. This is to reduce the risk of side effects on the stomach.\n- Take the tablets at around the same time each day.\n\nYou may see some remains of the tablet shell in your stools. This is normal and what is left of the \ntablet after all the medicine has been released.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe other medicines to lower the amount of sugar in your blood. Remember to \ntake other medicines as your doctor has told you. This will help get the best results for your health.\n\nDiet and exercise\nTo control your diabetes, you need to follow your doctor\u2019s advice on diet and exercise, even when you \nare taking this medicine. In particular, if you are following a diabetic weight control diet, continue to \nfollow it while you are taking Qtrilmet.\n\nIf you take more Qtrilmet than you should\nIf you take more Qtrilmet tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. \nTake the medicine pack with you. High overdose may lead to lactic acidosis (see sections 2 and 4).\n\nIf you forget to take Qtrilmet\nWhat to do if you forget to take Qtrilmet on time.\n- If it is less than 12 hours since you should have taken your daily dose, take a dose of Qtrilmet as \n\nsoon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time.\n- If it is more than 12 hours since you should have taken your daily dose, skip the missed dose. \n\nThen take your next dose at the usual time.\n- Do not take a double dose of Qtrilmet to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Qtrilmet\nDo not stop taking Qtrilmet without talking to your doctor first. Your blood sugar may rise without this \nmedicine.\n\n\n\n52\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.

belongs to a group of medicines called \"oral anti-diabetics\". this medicine is taken by mouth to treat diabetes and each of the active substances works in a different way to treat the condition. this medicine is for a type of diabetes called \"type 2 diabetes\". if you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin or your body is not able to use the insulin it produces properly. this leads to a high level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. the three medicines in qtrilmet lower the amount of sugar in the blood by causing it to be taken up into cells or passed out of the body in the urine. qtrilmet is only given to adults aged 18 years and older. it is used if other oral diabetes medicines, along with diet and exercise, cannot control your diabetes well enough. it is taken on its own, or it can be combined with a different type of diabetes medicine called a sulphonylurea.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "qtrilmet", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

to know before you take qtrilmet", "Section_Content": "do not take qtrilmet: - if you are allergic to metformin, saxagliptin, dapagliflozin, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); - if you have had a serious allergic reaction to some other medicines used to control your blood sugar, namely: o 'gliptins' (or dpp-4 inhibitors) like alogliptin, linagliptin and sitagliptin or, o 'gliflozins' (or sglt2 inhibitors) like canagliflozin and empagliflozin; - if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with: o severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood glucose), o nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, o lactic acidosis (see \"risk of lactic acidosis\" below), 48 o ketoacidosis, where substances called 'ketone bodies' build up in the blood and which can lead to a diabetic pre-coma. symptoms include stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness, or your breath developing an unusual fruity smell; - if you have ever had a diabetic coma; - if you have severely reduced kidney function; - if you have a severe infection; - if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration) due to long-lasting or severe diarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row (see \"warnings and precautions\" below); - if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your blood circulation or difficulties in breathing; - if you have problems with your liver; - if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either every day or only from time to time (please see section \"qtrilmet with alcohol\"). do not take qtrilmet if any of the above apply to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking qtrilmet. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking qtrilmet, and during treatment: - if you experience vomiting, stomach ache (abdominal pain), muscle cramps, a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness, difficulty breathing, reduced body temperature or slow heartbeat. these may be symptoms of a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis which can occur with qtrilmet, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. the risk of lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems, and medical conditions in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). stop taking qtrilmet and contact a doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately if you experience symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition is a medical emergency that may lead to coma; - if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. these may be symptoms of another rare, but very serious, sometimes life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. with this condition, the levels of substances called \"ketone bodies\" increase in your urine or blood and this can be picked up in tests. the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or major surgery or serious illness (which increase the body's needs for insulin). stop taking qtrilmet and contact a doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, as this condition is a medical emergency; - if you lose a lot of body fluids, such as with severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, nausea (feeling sick), increased sweating in heat, or if you are not able to eat or drink. stop taking qtrilmet for a short time if you have a condition that leads to dehydration and talk to your doctor about what to do and when to start taking qtrilmet again; - if you have \"type 1 diabetes\". qtrilmet should not be used to treat this condition; - if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas; - if you have reduced kidney function or liver problems; - if your body's ability to fight infections (immunity) is reduced, such as with a disease like aids or from medicines that you take after an organ transplant; - if you have ever had a serious hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction or your doctors have told you that you may have had one; - if you have or have had serious heart disease; 49 - if you have risk factors for developing heart failure, such as problems with your kidneys. your doctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. symptoms can include shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight, and swelling of the ankles or feet (pedal oedema). watch out for these symptoms and call your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse immediately if you get any of them; - if you have or have had low blood pressure (hypotension); - if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too much body fluid). possible signs of dehydration are listed in section 4. tell your doctor before you start taking qtrilmet if you have any of these signs; - if you often get infections of the urinary tract or have a serious infection of the urinary tract, including urosepsis or pyelonephritis, which can cause fever, chills, burning sensation when passing water (urinating), blood in urine, and pain in your back or side. you should call your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse immediately if you experience any of these symptoms; - if you have severe joint pain; - if you take pioglitazone to lower your blood sugar, qtrilmet may not be recommended to use; - if you take any of the following medicines: glucocorticoids, beta-2 agonists, diuretics, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampicin as they may reduce the effect of qtrilmet (see \"other medicines and qtrilmet\"); - if you are 75 years old or older; - if blood tests show that the amount of red blood cells in your blood is too high. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking qtrilmet. surgery and operations if you need major surgery, you must stop taking qtrilmet during and for some time after the operation. your doctor will decide when to stop and when to restart your treatment with qtrilmet. diabetic skin and foot problems skin damage, such as sores or ulcers is a common complication of diabetes. rash can occur with both saxagliptin and dapagliflozin (see section 4). follow the recommendations for skin care from your doctor or nurse. contact your doctor if you encounter blistering of the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. your doctor may ask you to stop qtrilmet. it is important to check your feet regularly and follow the advice on foot care from your health care professional. talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling generally unwell. these symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or fournier's gangrene which destroys the tissue under the skin. fournier's gangrene has to be treated immediately. kidney function you should have a blood test to check how well your kidneys are working before you start taking and while you are on this medicine. your kidney function will be checked at least once every year or more frequently if you are elderly or if you have worsening kidney function. urine test because of how qtrilmet works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine. children and adolescents qtrilmet is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been studied in these patients. other medicines and qtrilmet tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. in particular, talk to your doctor before taking qtrilmet if you are taking any of the following medicines: - medicines to lower blood pressure including ace inhibitors (such as enalapril or ramipril), angiotensin ii receptor antagonists (such as losartan or candesartan); - insulin, sulphonylureas (such as glimepiride) or pioglitazone to lower your blood sugar; - medicines that increase urine production and lower blood pressure (diuretics). your doctor may ask you to stop taking qtrilmet. possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed in section 4; - medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have reduced kidney function (such as verapamil, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib or olaparib); - if you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances: o beta-2 agonists used to treat asthma, o carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin medicines for preventing fits (seizure) or some types of long-term pain, o cimetidine used to treat stomach problems, o corticosteroids such as dexamethasone used to treat inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis, o diltiazem used to treat angina (chest pain) and lower blood pressure, o ketoconazole tablets used to treat cushing's syndrome (when the body produces an excess of cortisol), o rifampicin an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis, o non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as ibuprofen and celecoxib (a 'cox-2-inhibitor') used to treat pain and inflammation. if any of the above apply to you (or if you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking qtrilmet. if you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for example in the context of an x-ray or scan, you must stop taking qtrilmet before or at the time of the injection. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with qtrilmet. qtrilmet with alcohol avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking qtrilmet since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see \"warnings and precautions\" and \"do not take qtrilmet if you\"). pregnancy and breast-feeding qtrilmet is not recommended during pregnancy and your doctor will ask you to stop taking this medicine if you become pregnant or plan to have a baby. talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. you should not use qtrilmet if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. metformin passes into breast milk in small amounts. it is not known if saxagliptin and dapagliflozin pass into breast milk. talk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you would like to breast-feed or you are breast-feeding your baby. driving and using machines qtrilmet is not expected to affect you being able to drive a car or use any tools or machines. however, if you feel dizzy while taking qtrilmet, do not drive or use tools or machines. also, it may be dangerous to drive or use machines if your blood sugar levels fall too low (hypoglycaemia), which can cause shaking, sweating, fast heartbeat, change in vision, headache and confusion. qtrilmet contains lactose 51 qtrilmet contains lactose (milk sugar). if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. sodium content this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium- free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "qtrilmet", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "allergic", "Type": "PROBLEM", "BeginOffset": 35,
