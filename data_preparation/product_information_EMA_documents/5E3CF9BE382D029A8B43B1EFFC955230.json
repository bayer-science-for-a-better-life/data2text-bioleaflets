This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nWaylivra 285 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml contains 200 mg volanesorsen sodium, equivalent to 190 mg volanesorsen. \n\n \n\nEach single-dose pre-filled syringe contains 285 mg of volanesorsen in 1.5 ml solution. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection (injection). \n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution with a pH of approximately 8 and osmolarity of 363-485 \n\nmOsm/kg. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nWaylivra is indicated as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial \n\nchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and \n\ntriglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nTreatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of patients with FCS.  Prior to initiating Waylivra, secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia \n\n(e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism) should be excluded or appropriately addressed. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 285 mg in 1.5 ml injected subcutaneously once weekly for 3 \n\nmonths. Following 3 months, dose frequency should be reduced to 285 mg every 2 weeks.  \n\n \n\nHowever, treatment should be discontinued in patients with a reduction in serum triglycerides <25% \n\nor who fail to achieve serum triglycerides below 22.6 mmol/L after 3 months on volanesorsen 285 mg \n\nweekly. \n\n \n\nAfter 6 months of treatment with volanesorsen, increase of dose frequency to 285 mg weekly should \n\nbe considered if response has been inadequate in terms of serum triglyceride reduction as evaluated by \n\nthe supervising experienced specialist and in the condition that platelet counts are in the normal range. \n\nPatients should be re-downtitrated to 285 mg every 2 weeks if the higher 285 mg once weekly dose \n\ndoes not provide significant additional triglyceride reduction after 9 months. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to give the injection on the same day of the week, according to medically \n\ndetermined frequency of administration. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIf a dose is missed and noticed within 48 hours, the patient should be directed to give the missed dose \n\nas soon as possible. If not noticed within 48 hours, then the missed dose should be skipped and the \n\nnext planned injection given. \n\n \n\nPlatelet monitoring and dose adjustments \n\n \n\nBefore initiation of treatment, platelet count should be measured. If the platelet count is below 140 x \n\n109/L another measurement should be taken approximately a week later to reassess. If platelet count \n\nremains below 140 x 109/L upon a second measurement, Waylivra should not be initiated (see section \n\n4.3). \n\n \n\nAfter commencing treatment, patients should have platelet levels monitored at least every two weeks, \n\ndepending on the platelet levels. \n\n \n\nTreatment and monitoring should be adjusted according to laboratory values in line with Table 1.  \n\n \n\nFor any patient dose paused or discontinued due to severe thrombocytopenia, the benefits and risks of \n\nreturning to treatment once platelet count â‰¥100 x 109/L should be carefully considered. For \n\ndiscontinued patients, a haematologist should be consulted prior to resuming treatment. \n\n \n\nTable 1. Waylivra monitoring and treatment recommendations \n\nPlatelet Count (x109/L) \nDose \n\n(285 mg prefilled syringe) \nMonitoring Frequency \n\nNormal (â‰¥140) \nStarting dose: Weekly \n\nAfter 3 months: Every 2 weeks \nEvery 2 weeks \n\n100 to 139 Every 2 weeks Weekly \n\n75 to 99 \nPause treatment for â‰¥4 weeks and resume \n\ntreatment after platelet levels â‰¥ 100 x 109/L \nWeekly \n\n50 to 74a \nPause treatment for â‰¥4 weeks and resume \n\ntreatment after platelet levels â‰¥ 100 x 109/L \nEvery 2-3 days \n\nLess than 50a, b \nDiscontinue treatment \n\nGlucocorticoids recommended \nDaily \n\na  See section 4.4 for recommendations regarding use of antiplatelet agents/NSAIDs/anticoagulants \nb Consultation of a haematologist is needed to reconsider the benefit/risk for possible further treatment with \n\nvolanesorsen. \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nNo starting dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. There is limited clinical data for patients \n\naged 65 and over (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nNo starting dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The \n\nsafety and efficacy in patients with severe renal impairment has not been established and these patients \n\nshould be closely observed. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nThis medicinal product has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The medicinal \n\nproduct is not metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, therefore dose \n\nadjustment is unlikely to be required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of this medicinal product in children and adolescents below 18 years of age \n\nhave not yet been established. No data are available. \n\n  \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is intended for subcutaneous use only. Do not administer intramuscularly or \n\nintravenously. \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe is for single use only. \n\n \n\nWaylivra should be inspected visually prior to administration. The solution should be clear and \n\ncolourless to slightly yellow. If the solution is cloudy or contains visible particulate matter, the \n\ncontents must not be injected and the medicinal product should be returned to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\nThe first injection administered by the patient or caregiver should be performed under the guidance of \n\nan appropriately qualified health care professional. Patients and/or caregivers should be trained in the \n\nadministration of this medicinal product in accordance with the patient information leaflet. \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled syringe should be allowed to reach room temperature prior to injection. It should be \n\nremoved from refrigerated storage (2 Â° to 8 Â°C) at least 30 minutes before use. Other warming methods \n\nshould not be used. It is normal to see a large air bubble. Do not attempt to remove the air bubble. \n\n \n\nIt is important to rotate sites for injection. Sites for injection include the abdomen, upper thigh region, \n\nor outer area of the upper arm. If injected in the upper arm, the injection should be administered by \n\nanother person. Injection should be avoided at the waistline and other sites where pressure or rubbing \n\nmay occur from clothing. This medicinal product should not be injected into tattoos, moles, \n\nbirthmarks, bruises, rashes, or areas where the skin is tender, red, hard, bruised, damaged, burned, or \n\ninflamed. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nChronic or unexplained thrombocytopenia. Treatment should not be initiated in patients with \n\nthrombocytopenia (platelet count <140 x 109/L).  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nWaylivra is very commonly associated with reductions in platelet count in patients with FCS, which \n\nmay result in thrombocytopenia (see section 4.8). Patients with lower body weight (less than 70 kg) \n\nmay be more prone to thrombocytopenia during treatment with this medicinal product. Careful \n\nmonitoring for thrombocytopenia is important during treatment with this medicinal product in patients \n\nwith FCS (see section 4.2). Recommendations for adjustments to monitoring frequency and dosing are \n\nspecified in Table 1 (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of antiplatelet medicinal products/NSAIDs/anticoagulants should be considered for \n\nplatelet levels < 75 x 109/L. Treatment with these medicinal products must be discontinued at platelet \n\nlevels < 50 x 109/L (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to report to their physician immediately if they experience any signs of \n\nbleeding, which can include petechiae, spontaneous bruising, subconjunctival bleeding, or other \n\nunusual bleeding (including nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, stools, or unusually heavy menstrual \n\nbleeding), neck stiffness, atypical severe headache, or any prolonged bleeding. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nLDL-C Levels \n\nWith treatment with Waylivra, LDL-C levels may rise but will usually remain within the normal \n\nrange. \n\n \n\nRenal toxicity \n\nRenal toxicity has been observed after administration of volanesorsen and other subcutaneously and \n\nintravenously administered antisense oligonucleotides. Monitoring for evidence of nephrotoxicity by \n\nroutine urine dipstick is recommended on a quarterly basis. In the case of a positive assessment, a \n\nbroader assessment of renal function, including serum creatinine and a 24-hour collection to quantify \n\nthe proteinuria and assess creatinine clearance, should be performed. Treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued if: proteinuria of â‰¥ 500 mg/24 hour is recorded, or an increase in serum creatinine â‰¥ 0.3 \n\nmg/dL (26.5 Î¼mol/L) that is >ULN is recorded, or creatinine clearance estimated by the CKD-EPI \n\nequation is â‰¤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Treatment should also be discontinued for any clinical symptoms or \n\nsigns of renal impairment pending the previous confirmatory assessments. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\nElevations of liver enzymes have been observed after administration of other subcutaneously and \n\nintravenously administered antisense oligonucleotides. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity through serum \n\nliver enzymes and bilirubin should be assessed on a quarterly basis. Treatment should be discontinued \n\nif there is a single increase in ALT or AST > 8 x ULN, or an increase > 5 x ULN, which persists for â‰¥ \n\n2 weeks, or lesser increases in ALT or AST that are associated with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or INR \n\n> 1.5. Treatment should also be discontinued for any clinical symptoms or signs of hepatic impairment \n\nor hepatitis. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity and inflammation \n\nNo evidence of altered safety profile or clinical response was associated with presence of anti-drug \n\nantibodies. If formation of anti-drug antibodies with a clinically significant effect is suspected, contact \n\nthe Marketing Authorisation Holder to discuss antibody testing. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of inflammation should be assessed through quarterly assessment of erythrocyte \n\nsedimentation rate (ESR). \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 285 mg, that is to say it \n\nis essentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted. \n\n \n\nClinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are not expected between volanesorsen and \n\nsubstrates, inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and drug transporters. It is \n\nunknown whether triglyceride lowering by volanesorsen and the potentially ensuing decrease in \n\ninflammation leads to normalisation of CYP enzyme expression. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, this medicinal product has been used in combination with fibrates and fish oils with \n\nno impact on the medicinal product pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics. There were no adverse \n\nevents related to drug-drug interactions reported during the clinical program, however this is based on \n\nlimited data. \n\n \n\nThe effect of concomitant administration of this medicinal product with alcohol or medicinal products \n\nknown to have potential for hepatotoxicity (e.g., paracetamol) is unknown. If signs and symptoms of \n\nhepatotoxicity develop, use of the hepatotoxic medicinal product should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nAntithrombotic agents and medicinal products that may lower platelet count \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIt is not known whether the risk of bleeding is increased by concomitant use of volanesorsen and \n\nantithrombotic agents or medicinal products that may lower platelet count or affect platelet function. \n\nDiscontinuation of antiplatelet medicinal products/NSAIDs/anticoagulants should be considered for \n\nplatelet levels <75 x 109/L and treatment with these medicinal products should be stopped at platelet \n\nlevels < 50 x 109/L (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of volanesorsen in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n\n(see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of this medicinal product during \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIn non-clinical studies, levels of volanesorsen in milk were very low in lactating mice. Available \n\npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of very low amounts of \n\nvolanesorsen in milk (see section 5.3). Due to the poor oral bioavailability of this medicinal product, it \n\nis considered unlikely that these low milk concentrations would result in systemic exposure from \n\nnursing. \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether volanesorsen or metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \n\n \n\nA risk to the newborn infant cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy \n\ntaking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical data on the effect of this medicinal product on human fertility are available. Volanesorsen \n\nhad no effect on fertility in mice.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nVolanesorsen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with FCS, the most commonly reported adverse reactions during \n\ntreatment were platelet count decreased (see section 4.4), occurring in 40% of patients during the \n\npivotal studies, and injection site reactions, occurring in 82% of patients.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 2 presents the adverse reactions from the Phase 3 studies in patients with FCS in receiving \n\nvolanesorsen subcutaneously.  \n\n  \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (â‰¥1/10); \n\ncommon (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (â‰¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

In APPROACH and \n\nits open-label extension (CS7), patients discontinuing therapy due to platelet levels included 3 patients \n\nwith platelet counts <25 x 109/L, 2 with platelet counts between 25 x 109/L and 50 x 109/L, and 5 with \n\nplatelet counts between 50 x 109/L and 75 x 109/L. None of these patients had any major bleeding \n\nevents and all recovered to normal platelet count following drug discontinuation and administration of \n\nglucocorticosteroids where medically indicated. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nIn the Phase 3 clinical studies (CS16 and APPROACH), 16% and 30% of volanesorsen-treated \n\npatients tested positive for anti-drug antibodies during 6-month and 12-month treatment, respectively. \n\nNo evidence of altered safety profile or clinical response was associated with presence of anti-drug \n\nantibodies; however this is based on the limited long-term data (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInjection site reactions \n\nInjection site reactions defined as any local cutaneous reaction at the injection site persisting more \n\nthan 2 days occurred in 82% of volanesorsen-treated patients in the APPROACH study and its open-\n\nlabel extension (CS7). These local reactions were mostly mild and typically consisted of 1 or more of \n\n\n\n10 \n\nthe following: erythema, pain, pruritus, or local swelling. Injection site reactions did not occur with all \n\ninjections and resulted in discontinuation for 1 patient in the APPROACH study. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no clinical experience with overdose of this medicinal product. In the case of overdose, \n\npatients should be carefully observed and supportive care administered, as appropriate. Symptoms of \n\noverdose are expected to be limited to constitutional symptoms and injection site reactions. \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial given that volanesorsen is rapidly distributed into cells. \n\n  \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group:{Not yet assigned}, ATC code: {Not yet assigned} \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nVolanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit the formation of apoC-III, a protein \n\nthat is recognised to regulate both triglyceride metabolism and hepatic clearance of chylomicrons and \n\nother triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The selective binding of volanesorsen to the apoC-III messenger \n\nribonucleic acid (mRNA) within the 3â€² untranslated region at base position 489-508 causes the \n\ndegradation of the mRNA. This binding prevents translation of the protein apoC-III, thus removing an \n\ninhibitor of triglyceride clearance and enabling metabolism through an LPL-independent pathway. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nEffects of Waylivra on lipid parameters \n\nIn APPROACH, the Phase 3 clinical study in patients with FCS, Waylivra reduced fasting \n\ntriglycerides, total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apoC-III, apoB-48, and chylomicron triglyceride \n\nlevels and increased LDL-C, HDL-C, and apoB (see Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 3:  Mean Baseline and Percent Change in Lipid Parameters from Baseline to Month 3 \n\n \n\nLipid Parameter (g/L for \n\napoC-III, apoB, apoB-48; \n\nmmol/L for cholesterol, \n\ntriglycerides) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=33) \n\nVolanesorsen \n\n285 mg \n\n(N=33) \n\nBaseline % Change Baseline % Change \n\nTriglycerides 24.3 +24% 25.6 -72% \n\nTotal Cholesterol 7.3 +13% 7.6 -39% \n\nLDL-C 0.72 +7% 0.73 +139% \n\nHDL-C 0.43 +5% 0.44 +45% \n\nNon-HDL-C 6.9 +14% 7.1 -45% \n\nApoC-III 0.29 +6% 0.31 -84% \n\nApoB 0.69 +2% 0.65 +20% \n\nApoB-48 0.09 +16% 0.11 -75% \n\nChylomicron Triglycerides 20 +38% 22 -77% \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \n\nAt a drug concentration 4.1 times the peak drug plasma concentrations (Cmax) of the maximum \n\nrecommended dose (285 mg subcutaneous injection), volanesorsen did not prolong the heart-rate \n\ncorrected QT (QTc) interval.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n  \n\nAPPROACH study in patients with FCS \n\nThe APPROACH study is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled 52-week multicentre clinical \n\nstudy in 66 patients with FCS, evaluating volanesorsen 285 mg administered as a subcutaneous \n\ninjection (33 treated with volanesorsen, 33 with placebo). Main inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of \n\nFCS (Type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia) in combination with a history of chylomicronemia evidenced by \n\ndocumentation of lactescent serum or documentation of fasting TG measurement â‰¥ 880 mg/dl.  \n\nDiagnosis of FCS required documentation of at least one of the following: \n\na) Confirmed homozygote, compound heterozygote, or double heterozygote for known loss-of-\n\nfunction mutations in Type 1-causing genes (such as LPL, APOC2, GPIHBP1, or LMF1) \n\nb) Post heparin plasma LPL activity of â‰¤ 20% of normal.  \n\nPatients taking Glybera within 2 years prior to screening were excluded from the study. \n\n \n\nNineteen of the 33 patients in the volanesorsen group completed 12 months of study treatment. \n\nThirteen of these patients had dose adjustment/pause on the study. Out of the 13, 5 had a dose pause, 5 \n\nhad a dose adjustment and 3 had both a dose pause and dose adjustment.  \n\n \n\nMean age was 46 years (range 20-75 years; 5 patients â‰¥65 years old); 45% were men; 80% were \n\nWhite, 17% were Asian, and 3% were of other races. Mean body mass index was 25 kg/m2. A history \n\nof documented acute pancreatitis was reported for 76% of patients and a history of diabetes was \n\nreported for 15% of patients; 21% of patients had a recorded history of lipaemia retinalis and 23% of \n\npatients had a recorded history of eruptive xanthomas. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years, with \n\n23% shown to lack a known FCS genetic mutation. \n\n \n\nAt study entry, 55% of patients were on lipid lowering therapies (48% on fibrates, 29% on fish oils, \n\n20% HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), 27% were on pain medications, 20% were on platelet \n\naggregation inhibitors, and 14% were on nutritional supplements. Background lipid-lowering therapies \n\nremained consistent throughout the study. Patients were prohibited from receiving plasma apheresis \n\nwithin 4 weeks prior to screening or during the study; 11% of patients had previously received gene \n\ntherapy for lipoprotein lipase deficiency (i.e., alipogene tiparvovec), on average 8 years prior to \n\nstarting this study. After a 6-week diet run-in period, the mean fasting triglyceride level at baseline \n\nwas 2,209 mg/dL (25.0 mmol/L). Compliance with diet and alcohol restriction was reinforced through \n\nperiodic counselling sessions during the study. \n\n \n\nWaylivra led to a statistically significant reduction in triglyceride levels as compared to placebo at the \n\nprimary efficacy endpoint, defined as percent change from baseline to Month 3 in fasting triglycerides, \n\nin addition to a lower incidence of pancreatitis over the 52-week treatment period in a post-hoc \n\nanalysis (Table 4). \n\n \n\nAt the primary efficacy endpoint, the treatment difference between volanesorsen and placebo in mean \n\nfasting triglyceride percent change was -94% (95% CI: -122% -67%; pË‚0.0001, with a decrease of -\n\n77% from baseline (95% CI: -97, -56) in patients receiving volanesorsen and an increase of 18% from \n\nbaseline (95% CI: -4, 39) in patients receiving placebo (Table 4). \n\n \n\nTable 4:  Mean Change from Baseline in Fasting Triglycerides in the Phase 3 Placebo-\n\nControlled Study in Patients with FCS at Month 3 (APPROACH) \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n Placebo \n\n(N=33) \n\nVolanesorsen 285 mg \n\n(N = 33) \n\nRelative Difference in \n\nChange vs Placebo  \n\nLS Mean Percent \n\nChange (95% CI) \n+18% (-4, 39) -77% (-97, -56) -94%* (-122, -67) \n\nLS Mean Absolute \n\nChange (95% CI) \n\nmg/dL or mmol/L \n\n+92 (-301, +486) mg/dL \n\n+1 (-3, +5) mmol/L \n\n-1,712 (-2,094, -1,330) \n\nmg/dL \n\n-19 (-24, -15) mmol/L \n\n-1,804 (-2,306, -1,302) \n\nmg/dL \n\n-20 (-26, -15) mmol/L \n\n*p-value < 0.0001 (primary efficacy endpoint)  \n\nDifference= LS Mean of [volanesorsen % Change â€“ Placebo % Change] (ANCOVA model) \n\n \n\nOnset of the reduction was rapid with separation from placebo seen as early as 4 weeks and maximum \n\nresponse seen at 12 weeks, with clinically and statistically significant triglyceride reduction \n\nmaintained over 52 weeks (Figure 1). The mean fasting triglyceride percent change was significantly \n\ndifferent between volanesorsen and placebo arms at 3, 6, and 12 months; the volanesorsen arm \n\nincluded patients who did not complete dosing but who returned for assessments over the 52-week \n\nstudy.

A total \n\nof 67 patients have been treated and 50 (74%) patients remain on treatment, made up of 38 (76%) \n\npatients in the treatment-naÃ¯ve group, 9 (18%) in the APPROACH-volanesorsen group and 3 (6%) in \n\nthe CS16-volanesorsen group. Out of the 50 patients still on treatment, 8 have had a dose pause, 8 \n\nhave had a dose adjustment and 29 have had both a dose pause and a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nThe most recent data of the ongoing Study CS7 is provided in Table 6.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed \n\nbetween these patients and younger patients, however data are limited in this subpopulation. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nvolanesorsen in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of familial \n\nchylomicronemia syndrome (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called â€˜conditional approvalâ€™ scheme. This \n\nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \n\nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing subcutaneous injection, peak plasma concentrations of volanesorsen are typically reached in \n\n2 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of volanesorsen following a single subcutaneous \n\nadministration is approximately 80% (most likely higher because an AUC of 0 to 24 hours was used \n\nand volanesorsen has a half-life of >2 weeks). \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nFollowing a dose of 285 mg once weekly in patients with FCS, the estimated geometric mean \n\n(coefficient of variation % of geometric mean) steady-state Cmax is 8.92 Âµg/ml (35%), AUC0-168h is 136 \n\nÂµg*h/ml (38%), and Ctrough is 127 ng/ml (58%) in patients who remain negative for anti-drug antibody. \n\nAn alternative dosing regimen of 285 mg volanesorsen every two weeks results in a Ctrough,ss of \n\napproximately 58.0 ng/ml with Cmax and AUC similar compared to the once weekly dosing regimen. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nVolanesorsen was rapidly and widely distributed to tissues following subcutaneous or intravenous \n\nadministration in all species evaluated. The estimated steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) in \n\npatients with FCS is 330 L. Volanesorsen is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>98%) and the \n\nbinding is concentration independent. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies show that volanesorsen is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast \n\ncancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), \n\nbile salt export pump (BSEP), organic cation transporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion \n\ntransporters (OAT1, OAT3). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nVolanesorsen is not a substrate for CYP metabolism, and is metabolised in tissues by endonucleases to \n\nform shorter oligonucleotides that are then substrates for additional metabolism by exonucleases. \n\nUnchanged volanesorsen is the predominant circulating component. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that volanesorsen is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nElimination involves both metabolism in tissues and excretion in urine. Urinary recovery of the parent \n\ndrug was limited in humans with < 3% of administered subcutaneous dose recovered within 24 hours \n\npost dose. The parent drug and 5- to 7-mer chain-shortened metabolites accounted for approximately \n\n26% and 55% of oligonucleotides recovered in urine, respectively. Following subcutaneous \n\nadministration, terminal elimination half-life is approximately 2 to 5 weeks. \n\n \n\nIn animals, elimination of volanesorsen was slow and occurred mainly via urinary excretion, reflecting \n\nrapid plasma clearance principally to tissues. Both volanesorsen and shorter oligonucleotide \n\nmetabolites (predominantly 7-mer metabolites (generated either from 3â€²-deletions or 5â€²-deletions)) \n\nwere identified in human urine. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nSingle- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen in healthy volunteers and patients with \n\nhypertriglyceridemia have shown that the Cmax of volanesorsen is dose-proportional over a dose range \n\nof 100 to 400 mg and the AUC is slightly more than dose-proportional over the same dose range. \n\nSteady-state was reached approximately 3 months after starting volanesorsen. Accumulation in Ctrough \n\nwas observed (7- to 14-fold) and little or no increase in Cmax or AUC was observed following weekly \n\nSC administration over a dose of 200 to 400 mg. Some accumulation in AUC and Cmax was observed \n\nfor the 50 to 100 mg dose. Since the administered dose will be 285 mg every two weeks, or 142.5 mg \n\nweekly, little increase in Cmax or AUC is expected upon multiple dosing in the clinical setting. \n\n \n\nSpecial Populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that mild and moderate renal impairment has no \n\nclinically relevant effect on the systemic exposure of volanesorsen. No data are available in patients \n\nwith severe renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown. \n\n \n\nAge, sex, weight, and race \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, sex, or race has no clinically \n\nrelevant effect on volanesorsen exposure. There are limited data available in subjects >75 years of age. \n\n \n\nAnti-volanesorsen antibody formation affecting pharmacokinetics \n\nThe formation of binding antibodies to volanesorsen appeared to increase total Ctrough by 2- to 19-fold. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\n \n\nDose and time-dependent reductions in platelet counts were observed in Cynomolgus monkey \n\nrepeated dose studies. The decrease was gradual, self-sustaining and did not decrease to adverse \n\nlevels. In individual monkeys, severe thrombocytopenia was noted in the 9 month study of drug \n\ntreated groups at clinically relevant exposures and has also been observed in clinical studies. The \n\ndecrease in platelet counts was not acute and decreased to below 50,000 cells/Î¼l. Platelet counts \n\nrecovered after cessation of treatment, but decreased again below 50,000 cells/Î¼l after treatment was \n\nresumed in some monkeys. Decreased platelet counts were also observed in rodent repeated dose \n\nstudies. A mode of action for the observed thrombocytopenia is currently not known. \n\n \n\nIn nonclinical studies, levels of volanesorsen in milk were very low in lactating mice. The \n\nconcentrations in breast milk of mice were >800 fold lower than effective tissue concentrations in \n\nmaternal liver. Due to the poor oral bioavailability of volanesorsen, it is considered unlikely that these \n\nlow milk concentrations would result in systemic exposure from nursing (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nWaylivra 285 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \n\nvolanesorsen  \n\n \n\nâ–¼This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n-  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Waylivra is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Waylivra  \n\n3. How to use Waylivra  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Waylivra  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n1. What Waylivra is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWaylivra contains the active substance volanesorsen, which helps to treat a condition called familial \n\nchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS is a genetic disease which gives rise to abnormally high \n\nlevels of fats called triglycerides in the blood. This can lead to inflammation of your pancreas, causing \n\nsevere pain. Together with a controlled low-fat diet, Waylivra helps to lower the levels of triglycerides \n\nin your blood. \n\n \n\nWaylivra may be given after you have already received other medicines used to lower the levels of \n\ntriglycerides in blood without them having much effect. \n\n \n\nYou will only be given Waylivra if genetic testing has confirmed you have FCS and your risk for \n\npancreatitis is considered very high.. \n\n \n\nYou should continue the very low-fat diet that your doctor has prescribed during treatment with \n\nWaylivra.  \n\n \n\nThis medicine is intended for patients aged 18 years and above. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Waylivra  \n\n \n\nDo not use Waylivra if: \n\n- you are allergic to volanesorsen or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- you have a condition called thrombocytopenia, which means that you have a very low number \nof platelets in your blood (less than 140 x 109/L). You may notice this if you have an injury \n\nwhich causes bleeding and it takes a long time to stop (more than 5-6 minutes for a skin \n\nscratch). Your doctor will test for this before treatment with this medicine is started. You may \n\nnot know that you have this condition until this point, or what might have caused it. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before \n\nusing Waylivra. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Waylivra if you have or have had any of the \n\nfollowing medical problems: \n\n- Very high triglyceride levels which are not due to FCS. \n- A low number of platelets, a type of cell in your blood that clump together to help it clot \n\n(thrombocytopenia); your doctor will do a blood test before you start using this medicine to \n\ncheck the number of platelets in your blood.  \n\n- Any liver or kidney problems. \n \n\nBlood tests \n\nYour doctor will do a blood test before you start using this medicine to check the number of platelets, \n\nand then at regular intervals once you have started using Waylivra to check on platelet levels.  \n\nYou should see your doctor immediately if you have any signs of low platelet levels, such as unusual \n\nor prolonged bleeding, patches of red appearing on the skin (called petechiae), unexplained bruising, \n\nbleeding which will not stop, or nosebleeds, or if you get neck stiffness or a severe headache. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may also do a blood test every 3 months to check for signs of damage to your liver. You \n\nshould see your doctor immediately if you have any signs of liver damage, such as yellowing of your \n\nskin and eyeballs, pain or swelling in your abdomen, feeling or being sick, confusion or a general \n\nfeeling of being unwell. \n\n \n\nIf necessary, your doctor may change how often you use this medicine, or may stop it for a period. It \n\nmay be necessary to consult a doctor specialising in blood disorders to determine whether you should \n\ncontinue treatment with Waylivra or not. \n\n \n\nUrine tests \n\nYour doctor may do a urine and/or blood test every 3 months to check for signs of damage to your \n\nkidneys. You should see your doctor immediately if you have any signs of kidney damage, such as \n\nswelling in your \n\nankles, legs and feet, passing smaller amounts of urine than usual, shortness of breath, feeling sick, \n\nconfusion or feeling very tired or drowsy. \n\n \n\nDiet \n\nBefore starting this medicine, you should be on a diet designed to help lower triglyceride levels in \n\nyour blood.  \n\n \n\nIt is important that you maintain this triglyceride-lowering diet whilst using Waylivra. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not use Waylivra if you are under 18 years old. Waylivra has not been studied in patients under 18 \n\nyears old. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Waylivra \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \n\nmedicines. It is important to tell your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the following: \n\n- Medicines to prevent blood clots, e.g., acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamol or warfarin. \n- Other medicines that may change how your blood clots, including non-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory medicines like ibuprofen, medicines used to prevent heart attacks and strokes \n\nsuch as clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel, antibiotics such as penicillin, medicines such as \n\nranitidine (used to reduce stomach acid), and quinine (used to treat malaria). \n\n- Medicines that may cause problems with your liver, such as paracetamol. \n \n\nWaylivra with alcohol \n\n\n\n34 \n\nThe effect of taking Waylivra with alcohol is not known. You should avoid alcohol during treatment \n\nwith this medicine due to risk of liver issues. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  It is preferable to avoid the use of \n\nWaylivra during pregnancy. \n\nIt is not known if Waylivra passes into breast milk. It is recommended that you discuss breast-feeding \n\nwith your doctor to see what is best for you and your child. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nWaylivra is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Waylivra \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nBefore you are given this medicine other causes of high levels of triglycerides, such as diabetes or \n\nproblems with your thyroid, will be ruled out by your doctor. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you how often you should take this medicine. They may change how often you \n\nuse it, or may stop it for a period or permanently, depending on the results of your blood and urine \n\ntests or occurrence of side effects. \n\n \n\nYou or your caregiver will be trained on how to use Waylivra according to the instructions in this \n\nleaflet. Waylivra should be injected under your skin in the way the doctor, nurse or pharmacist has \n\nshown you, and you should make sure you inject all of the liquid in the syringe. Each single-use, pre-\n\nfilled syringe of this medicine gives you a dose of 285 mg in 1.5 ml. \n\n \n\nBefore using this medicine, it is important that you read, understand, and closely follow the \n\ninstructions for use. \n\n \n\nInstructions for use are provided at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Waylivra than you should \n\nIf you inject too much Waylivra, contact your doctor or pharmacist, or attend a hospital emergency \n\ndepartment immediately, even if there are no symptoms. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Waylivra \n\nIf you miss a dose, contact your doctor to ask when to take your next dose. If a dose is missed and \n\nnoticed within 48 hours, you should give the missed dose as soon as possible. If not noticed within 48 \n\nhours, then the missed dose should be skipped and the next planned injection given.  Do not inject \n\nmore than one dose within 2 days. \n\n  \n\nIf you stop using Waylivra  \n\nDo not stop using Waylivra unless you have discussed stopping your medicine with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n4.

This means that there is more evidence to come \n\nabout this medicine. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year and \n\nthis leaflet will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nInstructions for use \n\n \n\nWaylivra is an injection given under the skin with a single-use, disposable, pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\nDo not use Waylivra until you completely understand the procedure described below. If you have any \n\nquestions about how to use Waylivra, please contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nPre-filled syringe components \n\n \n\n \n \n\nGet ready to inject \n\n \n\n1. Wash hands and gather supplies \n \n\nWash your hands thoroughly with soap (for at least 3 minutes) and dry them well. \n\nPlace the following items on a clean, flat surface in a well-lit area (Figure A). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure A \n\n \n2. Allow the injection to reach to room temperature \n \n\nIf the syringe was in the refrigerator, allow the pre-\n\nfilled syringe to reach room temperature by removing \n\nit from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before the \n\n \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\ninjection. \n\n \n\nInjection with cold liquid may cause injection site \n\nreactions such as pain, redness, or swelling. \n\n \n\nDo not warm syringe in any other way, such as by \n\nmicrowave or warm water. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure B \n\n \n \n\n3. Check the expiry date \n \n\nCheck the expiry date on the carton. \n\n \n\nThe expiry date on the package refers to the life of the product when refrigerated.  \n\n \n\nThe date you first remove the pack from the refrigerator should be recorded on the outer carton in the \n\nspace indicated. \n\n \n\nDo not use Waylivra if the expiry date has passed or if it was stored for longer than 6 weeks at room \n\ntemperature. Call your doctor or pharmacist to get a new supply. \n\n \n \n\n4. Remove the syringe and inspect the medicine \n \n\nOpen the carton and remove the syringe by grasping the \n\nsyringe barrel and pulling it straight out (Figure C). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure C \n\n \n\nLook at the liquid in the syringe. The medicine should be \n\nclear to slightly yellow in color. It is normal to see a large \n\nair bubble (Figure D). \n\n \n\nDo not try to remove the air bubble before injecting. \n\nInjecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. \n\n \n\nDo not use the pre-filled syringe if the liquid is cloudy or \n\nhas floating particles. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure D \n\n \n5. Choose an injection site \n \n\nIf self-injecting: \n\n \n\nStomach â€“ Stomach area as shown, except for 2 \n\ninches around the belly button. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nThighs â€“ Front, middle area as shown (Figure E). \n\n \n \n\nFigure E \n\nIf administering an injection to someone else as a \n\ncaregiver, in addition to the above sites: \n\n \n\nArms â€“ Back of upper area as shown (Figure F).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFor all injections: \n\n \n\nAlternate the injection area for each injection.  \n\n \n\nAvoid injecting at the waistline where your clothing may \n\nrub or press the injection area.  \n\n \n\nDo not inject into tattoos, moles, scars, birthmarks, \n\nbruises, rashes, or areas where the skin is tender, red, \n\nhard, damaged, burned, or inflamed. \n\n \n\nTalk to your healthcare provider if you are unsure of \n\nwhere to inject. \n\n \n \n\nFigure F \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nInjecting \n\n \n\n6. Prepare injection site \n \n\nClean your chosen injection site with an alcohol pad  \n\n(Figure G). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure G \n\n \n\n7. Remove needle cap \n\n \n\nRemove the needle cap by holding the barrel of the \n\nsyringe with the needle pointing away from you and \n\npulling the needle cap straight off (Figure H). \n\n \n\nYou may see a drop of liquid at the tip of the needle. This \n\nis normal. \n\n \n\nDo not hold the plunger rod or the plunger head while \n\nremoving the needle cap. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nDo not use the pre-filled syringe if the needle appears \n\ndamaged. \n\n \n\nDo not use the pre-filled syringe if it is dropped with \n\nthe needle cap removed. \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure H \n\n \n\n8. Pinch the skin \n\n \n\nUsing your free hand, pinch the skin around the injection \n\nsite (Figure I). \n\n \n \n\nFigure I \n\n \n9. Insert needle \n \n\nInsert the needle into the injection site with a quick, firm \n\nmotion without touching the plunger head. The needle \n\nshould be inserted at a 45 degree angle to the skin surface \n\n(Figure J).  \n\n \n \n\nFigure J \n\n \n10. Inject Waylivra \n \n\nInject the liquid by holding the syringe with your thumb \n\non the plunger, and slowly push the plunger down as far \n\nas it will go, until the syringe is completely empty (Figure \n\nK and L). \n\n \n \n\nFigure K \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure L \n\n \n11. Remove Needle \n \n\nRemove the needle from the injection site by pulling out \n\nat the same angle it was inserted (Figure M). \n\n \n \n\nFigure M \n\n \n\nAfter the Injection \n\n \n\n12. Dispose of the Used Syringe into a Sharps Container \n\n \n\nImmediately after the injection, dispose of the used \n\nsyringe as instructed by your healthcare professional, \n\nusually into a sharps disposal container (Figure N) by \n\nfollowing these steps.  \n\n \n\nThrow away the needle cap after injecting. \n\n \n\nDo not recap the syringe. \n\n \n\nIf you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may \n\nuse a household container that is: \n\n \n\nâ€¢ Made of heavy-duty plastic,  \nâ€¢ Capable of being closed with a tight-fitting, Puncture-\n\nresistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,  \n\nâ€¢ Upright and stable during use,  \nâ€¢ Leak-resistant,  \nâ€¢ Properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the \n\ncontainer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure N \n\nWhen your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community \n\nguidelines for proper disposal of the sharps container. There may be special local laws regarding how \n\nyou should throw away used needles and syringes. Ask your pharmacist or see your local public health \n\ngovernment website (where available) for more details on how you should dispose of sharps in your \n\nlocation.  \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nDo not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household waste.  \n\n \n\nDo not recycle your used sharps disposal container. \n\n  \n\nAlways keep your sharps container away from children and pets. \n\n \n13.
