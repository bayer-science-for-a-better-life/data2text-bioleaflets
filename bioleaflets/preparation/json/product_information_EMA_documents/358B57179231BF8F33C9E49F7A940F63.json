NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n  \nRivaroxaban Accord 2.5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg rivaroxaban. \n \nExcipient with known effect  \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 27.90 mg lactose (as monohydrate), see section 4.4. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n \nLight yellow coloured, round, biconvex, approximately 6.00 mm in diameter, film coated tablets \ndebossed with “IL4” on one side and plain on other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRivaroxaban Accord, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus \nticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an acute \ncoronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nRivaroxaban Accord, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention \nof atherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic \nperipheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nThe recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily. \n \n• ACS  \n\n \nPatients taking Rivaroxaban Accord 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75-100 mg \nASA or a daily dose of 75-100 mg ASA in addition to standard daily dose of ticlopidine. \n \nTreatment should be regularly evaluated in the individual patient weighing the risk for ischaemic \nevents against the bleeding risks. Extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an \nindividual patient basis as experience up to 24 months is limited (see section 5.1). \n \nTreatment with rivaroxaban should be started as soon as possible after stabilisation of the ACS event \n(including revascularisation procedures); at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at the \ntime when parenteral anticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued. \n \n• CAD/PAD \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients taking Rivaroxaban Accord 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75-100 mg \nASA.  \n \nDuration of treatment should be determined for each individual patient based on regular evaluations \nand should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus the bleeding risks.  \n \nIn patients with an acute thrombotic event or vascular procedure and a need for dual antiplatelet \ntherapy, the continuation of Rivaroxaban Accord 2.5 mg twice daily should be evaluated depending on \nthe type of event or procedure and antiplatelet regimen. Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg \ntwice daily in combination with ASA plus ticlopidine has only been studied in patients with recent \nACS (see section 4.1). Dual antiplatelet therapy has not been studied in combination with Rivaroxaban \nAccord 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with CAD/PAD (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should continue with the regular dose as recommended at the next \nscheduled time. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to rivaroxaban \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, International Normalised Ratio (INR) values \ncould be falsely elevated after the intake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the \nanticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from rivaroxaban to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that rivaroxaban can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from rivaroxaban to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \n≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both rivaroxaban and VKA \nthe INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nrivaroxaban. Once Rivaroxaban Accord is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least \n24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to rivaroxaban \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the \nparenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of \ndiscontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous \nunfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban \nAccord is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine \nclearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50-80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \nRivaroxaban Accord is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy \nand clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nThe risk of bleeding increases with increasing age (see section 4.4). \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for use in children below \n18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is for oral use. \nThe tablets are to be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may be crushed and \nmixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  \nThe crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of \nthe correct gastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount \nof water via a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water (see section 5.2 and 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant treatment of ACS with antiplatelet therapy in patients with a prior stroke or a transient \nischaemic attack (TIA) (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant treatment of CAD/PAD with ASA in patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar \nstroke, or any stroke within a month (see section 4.4).  \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn ACS patients, efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg have been investigated in combination \nwith the antiplatelet agents ASA alone or ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine. Treatment in combination \nwith other antiplatelet agents, e.g. prasugrel or ticagrelor, has not been studied and is not \nrecommended. In patients at high risk of ischaemic events with CAD/PAD, efficacy and safety of \nrivaroxaban 2.5 mg have only been investigated in combination with ASA. \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \n \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Accord are to be carefully observed for \nsigns of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of \nhaemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Accord administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage \noccurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment on top of single or dual anti-platelet therapy. Thus, in addition \nto adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, the use \nof rivaroxaban in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at known increased risk for \nbleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. In \naddition these patients are to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications \nand anaemia after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nRivaroxaban Accord is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min. Use \nis not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations rivaroxaban is \nto be used with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nThe use of Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic \ntreatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors \nof both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a \n\n\n\n6 \n\nclinically relevant degree (2.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \nPatients on treatment with rivaroxaban and ASA or rivaroxaban and ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine \nshould only receive concomitant treatment with NSAIDs if the benefit outweighs the bleeding risk. \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \n \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nIt should be used with caution in ACS and CAD/PAD patients: \n• ≥ 75 years of age if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or \n\nticlopidine. The benefit-risk of the treatment should be individually assessed on a regular basis.  \n• with lower body weight (< 60 kg) if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus \n\nclopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n• CAD patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Study data indicate that such patients may \n\nbenefit less from treatment with rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \n \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been \nstudied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that rivaroxaban \nprovides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Rivaroxaban Accord is \nnot recommended for these patients. \nPatients with prior stroke or TIA \n \nPatients with ACS  \nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg is contraindicated for the treatment of ACS in patients with a prior stroke or TIA \n(see section 4.3). Few ACS patients with a prior stroke or TIA have been studied but the limited \nefficacy data available indicate that these patients do not benefit from treatment. \n \nPatients with CAD/PAD  \nCAD/PAD patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or an ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke \nwith in the previous month were not studied (see section 4.3).  \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \n \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 2.5 mg with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine in \nthese situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). However, the exact \ntiming to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \nPlatelet aggregation inhibitors should be discontinued as suggested by the manufacturer’s prescribing \ninformation. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention \n \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Accord 2.5 mg should be \nstopped at least 12 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and anti-platelet effect is not desired, platelet \naggregation inhibitors should be discontinued as directed by the manufacturer’s prescribing \ninformation. \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nRivaroxaban Accord should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as \ndetermined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \n \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \n \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6-fold / 2.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7-fold / 1.6-fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in \nhigh-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \n \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response. \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \n \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or \nnon-major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \n \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, \nanti-factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On \nthe fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50 % decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4.  \nNo clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the \nintrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, rivaroxaban is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from \nanimals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore, rivaroxaban is contraindicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRivaroxaban has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like \nsyncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \n \nIndication  \n \n \n\nNumber of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose Maximum \ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective \nhip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill patients 3,997 10 mg 39 days \n \n\nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), \npulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of \nrecurrence \n \n\n6,790 Day 1-21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 months: \n10 mg or 20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation  \n\n7,750  \n \n\n20 mg  \n \n\n41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients after an ACS \n \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, \nco-administered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with CAD/PAD  \n\n18,244  \n \n\n5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone  \n\n47 months  \n \n\n*Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

selective approach to adverse event collection was applied. As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study \ndata were not included for frequency calculation in this table.  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of rivaroxaban may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post \nhaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \n“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, \ngastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and \nanaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA \ntreatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of \nhaemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical \nrelevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in \ncertain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on \nconcomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual \nbleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, \npaleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some \ncases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris \nhave been observed. \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for rivaroxaban. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n14 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above. \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa).  \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \n \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor \nXa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered.  However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. \nDepending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert should be considered in case \nof major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-factor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nACS  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in subjects with a recent \nACS (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction \n[NSTEMI] or unstable angina [UA]). In the pivotal double-blind ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study, \n15,526 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment groups: \nrivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily, 5 mg orally twice daily or to placebo twice daily \nco-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine). \nPatients with an ACS under the age of 55 had to have either diabetes mellitus or a previous MI. The \nmedian time on treatment was 13 months and overall treatment duration was up to almost 3 years. \n93.2% of patients received ASA concomitantly plus thienopyridine treatment and 6.8% ASA only. \nAmong patients receiving dual antiplatelets therapy 98.8% received clopidogrel, 0.9% received \nticlopidine and 0.3% received prasugrel. Patients received the first dose of rivaroxaban at a minimum \nof 24 hours and up to 7 days (mean 4.7 days) after admission to the hospital, but as soon as possible \nafter stabilisation of the ACS event, including revascularisation procedures and when parenteral \nanticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued. \nBoth the 2.5 mg twice daily and the 5 mg twice daily regimens of rivaroxaban were effective in further \nreducing the incidence of CV events on a background of standard antiplatelet care. The 2.5 mg twice \ndaily regimen reduced mortality, and there is evidence that the lower dose had lower bleeding risks, \ntherefore rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or \nwith ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine is recommended for the prevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in adult patients after an ACS with elevated cardiac biomarkers. \nRelative to placebo, rivaroxaban significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of CV death, \nMI or stroke. The benefit was driven by a reduction in CV death and MI and appeared early with a \nconstant treatment effect over the entire treatment period (see Table 4 and Figure 1). Also, the first \nsecondary endpoint (all-cause death, MI or stroke) was reduced significantly. An additional \nretrospective analysis showed a nominally significant reduction in the incidence rates of stent \nthrombosis compared with placebo (see Table 4). The incidence rates for the principal safety outcome \n(non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) TIMI major bleeding events) were higher in patients \ntreated with rivaroxaban than in patients who received placebo (see Table 6). However, the incidence \nrates were balanced between rivaroxaban and placebo for the components of fatal bleeding events, \nhypotension requiring treatment with intravenous inotropic agents and surgical intervention for \nongoing bleeding. \nIn Table 5 the efficacy results of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are \npresented. The safety results in this subgroup of patients undergoing PCI were comparable to the \noverall safety results. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPatients with elevated biomarkers (troponin or CK-MB) and without a prior stroke/TIA constituted \n80 % of the study population. The results of this patient population were also consistent with the \noverall efficacy and safety results. \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 \nStudy population Patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome a) \n\nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, twice daily, \nN=5,114 n (%) \nHazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) p-value b) \n\nPlacebo \nN=5,113  \nn (%) \n\nCardiovascular death, MI or stroke 313 (6.1%) \n0.84 (0.72, 0.97) p = 0.020* \n\n376 (7.4%) \n\nAll-cause death, MI or stroke 320 (6.3%) \n0.83 (0.72, 0.97) p = 0.016* \n\n386 (7.5%) \n\nCardiovascular death 94 (1.8%) \n0.66 (0.51, 0.86) p = 0.002** \n\n143 (2.8%) \n\nAll-cause death 103 (2.0%) \n0.68 (0.53, 0.87) p = 0.002** \n\n153 (3.0%) \n\nMI 205 (4.0%) \n0.90 (0.75, 1.09) p = 0.270 \n\n229 (4.5%) \n\nStroke 46 (0.9%) \n1.13 (0.74, 1.73) p = 0.562 \n\n41 (0.8%) \n\nStent thrombosis 61 (1.2%) \n0.70 (0.51, 0.97) p = 0.033** \n\n87 (1.7%) \n\na) modified intent to treat analysis set (intent to treat total analysis set for stent thrombosis) \nb) vs. placebo; Log-Rank p-value \n* statistically superior \n** nominally significant \n \nTable 5: Efficacy results from phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 in patients undergoing PCI \nStudy population Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome undergoing \n\nPCI a) \nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, twice daily, \n\nN=3114 n (%) \nHR (95% CI) p-value b) \n\nPlacebo \nN=3096 \n n (%) \n\nCardiovascular death, MI or stroke 153 (4.9%) \n0.94 (0.75, 1.17) p = 0.572 \n\n165 (5.3%) \n\nCardiovascular death 24 (0.8%) \n0.54 (0.33, 0.89) p = 0.013** \n\n45 (1.5%) \n\nAll-cause death 31 (1.0%) \n0.64 (0.41, 1.01) p = 0.053 \n\n49 (1.6%) \n\nMI 115 (3.7%) \n1.03 (0.79, 1.33) p = 0.829 \n\n113 (3.6%) \n\nStroke 27 (0.9%) \n1.30 (0.74, 2.31) p = 0.360 \n\n21 (0.7%) \n\nStent thrombosis 47 (1.5%) \n0.66 (0.46, 0.95) p = 0.026** \n\n71 (2.3%) \n\na) modified intent to treat analysis set (intent to treat total analysis set for stent thrombosis) \nb) vs. placebo; Log-Rank p-value \n** nominally significant \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 6: Safety results from phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 \n \nStudy population Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome a) \nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, twice \n\ndaily, N=5,115 n (%) \nHR (95% CI) p-value b) \n\nPlacebo \nN=5,125 n (%) \n\nNon-CABG TIMI major \nbleeding event \n\n65 (1.3%) \n3.46 (2.08, 5.77) p = < 0.001* \n\n19 (0.4%) \n\nFatal bleeding event 6 (0.1%) \n0.67 (0.24, 1.89) p = 0.450 \n\n9 (0.2%) \n\nSymptomatic intracranial \nhaemorrhage \n\n14 (0.3%) \n2.83 (1.02, 7.86) p = 0.037 \n\n5 (0.1%) \n\nHypotension requiring treatment \nwith intravenous inotropic agents \n\n3 (0.1%) 3 (0.1%) \n\nSurgical intervention for \nongoing bleeding \n\n7 (0.1%) 9 (0.2%) \n\nTransfusion of 4 or more units \nof blood over a 48 hour period \n\n19 (0.4%) 6 (0.1%) \n\n  \na) safety population, on treatment b) vs. placebo; Log-Rank p-value \n* statistically significant \n \nFigure 1: Time to first occurrence of primary efficacy endpoint (CV death, MI or stroke) \n\n \n \nCAD/PAD  \n \nThe phase III COMPASS study (27,395 patients, 78.0% male, 22.0% female) demonstrated the \nefficacy and safety of Rivaroxaban for the prevention of a composite of CV death, MI, stroke in \npatients with CAD or symptomatic PAD at high risk of ischaemic events.

For patients < 65 years of age atherosclerosis \ninvolving at least two vascular beds or at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were \nrequired.  \n \nPAD patients had previous interventions such as bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal \nangioplasty or limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease or intermittent claudication with \nankle/arm blood pressure ratio < 0.90 and/ or significant peripheral artery stenosis or previous carotid \nrevascularization or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%.  \n \nExclusion criteria included the need for dual antiplatelet or other non-ASA antiplatelet or oral \nanticoagulant therapy and patients with high bleeding risk, or heart failure with ejection fraction \n< 30% or New York Heart Association class III or IV, or any ischaemic, non lacunar stroke within \n1 month or any history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke.  \n \nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily was superior to ASA \n100 mg, in the reduction of the primary composite outcome of CV death, MI, stroke (see Table 7 and \nFigure 2).  \n \nThere was a significant increase of the primary safety outcome (modified ISTH major bleeding events) \nin patients treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily \ncompared to patients who received ASA 100 mg (see Table 8).  \nFor the primary efficacy outcome, the observed benefit of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus ASA \n100 mg once daily compared with ASA 100 mg once daily was HR=0.89 (95% CI 0.7-1.1) in patients \n≥ 75 years (incidence: 6.3% vs 7.0%) and HR=0.70 (95% CI 0.6-0.8) in patients <75 years (3.6% vs \n5.0%). For modified ISTH major bleeding, the observed risk increase was HR=2.12 (95% CI 1.5-3.0) \nin patients ≥75 years (5.2% vs 2.5%) and HR=1.53 (95% CI 1.2--1.9) in patients <75 years (2.6% vs \n1.7%). \n \nThe use of pantoprazole 40 mg once daily in addition to antithrombotic study medication in patients \nwith no clinical need for a proton pump inhibitor showed no benefit in the prevention of upper \ngastrointestinal events (i.e. composite of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, upper gastrointestinal \nulceration, or upper gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation); the incidence rate of upper \ngastrointestinal events was 0.39/100 patient-years in the pantoprazole 40 mg once daily group and \n0.44/100 patient-years in the placebo once daily group. \n \nTable 7: Efficacy results from phase III COMPASS \n \nStudy \npopulation  \n\nPatients with CAD/PAD a)  \n \n\nTreatment dose  \n \n\nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg \nbid in combination \nwith ASA 100 mg od  \nN=9152  \n\nASA 100 mg od  \n \n \nN=9126  \n\n \n\n Patients \nwith \nevents  \n\nKM %  \n \n\nPatients \nwith \nevents  \n\nKM %  \n \n\nHR (95% \nCI)  \n\np-value b)  \n\n \nStroke, MI or CV \ndeath  \n\n379 (4.1%)  \n \n\n5.20%  \n \n\n496 (5.4%)  \n \n\n7.17%  \n \n\n0.76 \n(0.66;0.86)  \n\np = 0.00004*  \n \n\n- Stroke  83 (0.9%)  \n \n\n1.17%  \n \n\n142 (1.6%)  \n \n\n2.23%  \n \n\n0.58 \n(0.44;0.76)  \n\np = 0.00006  \n \n\n- MI  178 (1.9%)  \n \n\n2.46%  \n \n\n205 (2.2%)  \n \n\n2.94%  \n \n\n0.86 \n(0.70;1.05)  \n\np = 0.14458  \n \n\n- CV death  160 (1.7%)  \n \n\n2.19%  \n \n\n203 (2.2%)  \n \n\n2.88%  \n \n\n0.78 \n(0.64;0.96)  \n\np = 0.02053  \n \n\n \nAll-cause 313 (3.4%)  4.50%  378 (4.1%)  5.57%  0.82  \n\n\n\n19 \n\nmortality      (0.71;0.96)  \nAcute limb \nischaemia  \n\n22 (0.2%)  \n \n\n0.27%  \n \n\n40 (0.4%)  \n \n\n0.60%  \n \n\n0.55 \n(0.32;0.92)  \n\n \n\na) intention to treat analysis set, primary analyses  \nb) vs. ASA 100 mg; Log-Rank p-value  \n* The reduction in the primary efficacy outcome was statistically superior.  \nbid: twice daily; CI: confidence interval; KM %: Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence risk \ncalculated at 900 days; CV: cardiovascular; MI: myocardial infarction; od: once daily  \n \nTable 8: Safety results from phase III COMPASS \nStudy population  Patients with CAD/PAD a) \nTreatment dose  Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg \n\nbid in combination \nwith ASA 100 mg od, \n\nN=9152  \nn (Cum. risk %) \n\nASA 100 mg od  \n \n \n\nN=9126  \nn (Cum.risk %)  \n\nHazard Ratio  \n(95 % CI)  \n\n \np-value b)  \n\n \nModified ISTH major bleeding  \n \n\n288 (3.9%)  \n \n\n170 (2.5%)  \n \n\n1.70 (1.40;2.05)  \np < 0.00001  \n\n- Fatal bleeding event  \n \n\n15 (0.2%)  \n \n\n10 (0.2%)  \n \n\n1.49 (0.67;3.33)  \np = 0.32164  \n\n- Symptomatic bleeding in \ncritical organ (non-fatal)  \n\n63 (0.9%)  \n \n\n49 (0.7%)  \n \n\n1.28 (0.88;1.86)  \np = 0.19679  \n\n- Bleeding into the surgical \nsite requiring reoperation \n(non-fatal, not in critical \norgan)  \n\n10 (0.1%)  \n \n\n8 (0.1%)  \n \n\n1.24 (0.49;3.14)  \np = 0.65119  \n \n\n- Bleeding leading to \nhospitalisation (non-fatal, not \nin critical organ, not requiring \nreoperation)  \n\n208 (2.9%)  \n \n\n109 (1.6%)  \n \n\n1.91 (1.51;2.41)  \np < 0.00001  \n \n\n- With overnight stay  172 (2.3%)  \n \n\n90 (1.3%)  \n \n\n1.91 (1.48;2.46)  \np < 0.00001  \n\n- Without overnight stay  36 (0.5%)  \n \n\n21 (0.3%)  \n \n\n1.70 (0.99;2.92)  \np = 0.04983  \n\nMajor gastrointestinal bleeding  \n \n\n140 (2.0%)  \n \n\n65 (1.1%)  \n \n\n2.15 (1.60;2.89)  \np < 0.00001  \n\nMajor intracranial bleeding  \n \n\n28 (0.4%)  \n \n\n24 (0.3%)  \n \n\n1.16 (0.67;2.00)  \np = 0.59858  \n\na) intention-to-treat analysis set, primary analyses  \nb) vs. ASA 100 mg; Log-Rank p-value  \nbid: twice daily; CI: confidence interval; Cum.

The overall median study treatment duration was 504 days. \nPatients must have had symptomatic HF for at least 3 months and left ventricular ejection fraction \n(LVEF) of ≤ 40% within one year of enrollment. At baseline, the median ejection fraction was 34% \n(IQR: 28%-38%) and 53% of subjects were NYHA Class III or IV. \nThe primary efficacy analysis (i.e. composite of all-cause mortality, MI, or stroke) showed no \nstatistically significant difference between the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid group and the placebo group \nwith a HR=0.94 (95% CI 0.84 - 1.05), p=0.270. For all-cause mortality, there was no difference \nbetween rivaroxaban and placebo in the number of events (event rate per 100 patient-years; 11.41 vs. \n11.63, HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.10; p=0.743). The event rates for MI per 100 patient-years \n(rivaroxaban vs placebo) were 2.08 vs 2.52 (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.08; p=0.165) and for stroke \nthe event rates per 100 patient-years were 1.08 vs 1.62 (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95; p=0.023). The \nprincipal safety outcome (i.e. composite of fatal bleeding or bleeding into a critical space with a \npotential for permanent disability), occurred in 18 (0.7%) patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice \ndaily treatment group and in 23 (0.9%) patients in the placebo group, respectively (HR=0.80; 95% CI \n0.43 - 1.49; p=0.484). There was a statistically significant increase in ISTH major bleeding in the \nrivaroxaban group compared with placebo (event rate per 100 patient-years: 2.04 vs 1.21, HR 1.68; \n95% CI: 1.18 to 2.39; p=0.003). \nIn patients with mild and moderate heart failure the treatment effects for the COMPASS study \nsubgroup were similar to those of the entire study population (see section CAD/PAD). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I \nantibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess \nof events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were \nrandomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) \nand 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0- 3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to \nrivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients \nrandomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 \npatients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \nprevention of thromboembolic events (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100 %) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be \ntaken with or without food. \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily. At higher doses \nrivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and decreased \nabsorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state than in fed state. Variability \nin rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) ranging from \n30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5-fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25 %). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2-fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3-fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6-fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT. \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min) renal \n\n\n\n23 \n\nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6-fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 – 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \n \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with ACS the geometric mean concentration (90% prediction interval) 2-4 h and about 12 h \nafter dose (roughly representing maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was \n47 (13-123) and 9.2 (4.4-18) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 – 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcgl). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre-and postnatal \nstudy in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee \nreplacement surgery. \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nPrevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg rivaroxaban taken orally once daily. The initial dose should be taken \n6 to 10 hours after surgery, provided that haemostasis has been established. \n \nThe duration of treatment depends on the individual risk of the patient for venous thromboembolism \nwhich is determined by the type of orthopaedic surgery. \n• For patients undergoing major hip surgery, a treatment duration of 5 weeks is recommended. \n• For patients undergoing major knee surgery, a treatment duration of 2 weeks is recommended. \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord immediately and then continue the \nfollowing day with once daily intake as before. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Accord 10 mg \nonce daily, a dose of rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and prevention \nof recurrent DVT and PE \n\nDay 1-21 15 mg twice daily 30 mg \nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily 20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nFollowing completion of \nat least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily \nor 20 mg once \ndaily \n\n10 mg \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Rivaroxaban Accord for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nRivaroxaban Accord immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg rivaroxaban per day. In this case two \n15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily \nintake as recommended on the following day. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord \nimmediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose \nshould not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to rivaroxaban \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nRivaroxaban Accord therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5.  \n \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, International Normalised Ratio (INR) values \nwill be falsely elevated after the intake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the \nanticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from rivaroxaban to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that rivaroxaban can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from rivaroxaban to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \n≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both rivaroxaban and VKA \nthe INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nrivaroxaban. Once Rivaroxaban Accord is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least \n24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to rivaroxaban \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the \nparenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of \ndiscontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous \nunfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban \nAccord is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine \nclearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n- For the prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement \n\nsurgery, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 50-80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) \n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, no dose \n\nadjustment from the recommended dose is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15-29 ml/min) renal impairment: patients should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first \n3 weeks. Thereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose \nfrom 20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk \nfor bleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of \n15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nRivaroxaban Accord is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy \nand clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for use in children below \n18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is for oral use. \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may be crushed and \nmixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  \n \nThe crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of \nthe correct gastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount \nof water via a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water (see section 5.2 and 6.6). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \n \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Accord are to be carefully observed for \nsigns of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of \nhaemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Accord administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage \noccurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8). In patients receiving rivaroxaban for VTE prevention \nfollowing elective hip or knee replacement surgery, this may be done by regular physical examination \nof the patients, close observation of the surgical wound drainage and periodic measurements of \nhaemoglobin. Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a \nbleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nRivaroxaban Accord is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min. Use \nis not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Rivaroxaban \nAccord is to be used with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nThe use of Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic \ntreatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors \nof both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a \nclinically relevant degree (2.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \n \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \n \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been \nstudied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that rivaroxaban \nprovides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Rivaroxaban Accord is \nnot recommended for these patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta \n2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nHip fracture surgery \n \nRivaroxaban has not been studied in interventional clinical studies in patients undergoing hip fracture \nsurgery to evaluate efficacy and safety. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with \npulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations. \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \n \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.  \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). \nAt least 18 hours should elapse after the last administration of rivaroxaban before removal of an \nepidural catheter. Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours should elapse before the next \nrivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention other than \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery \n \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Accord 10 mg should be \nstopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician. \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nRivaroxaban Accord should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as \ndetermined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \n \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \n \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6-fold / 2.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7-fold / 1.6-fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in \nhigh-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \n \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response. \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n\n\n33 \n\nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \n \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or \nnon-major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \n \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, \nanti-factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On \nthe fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50 % decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \nNo clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the \nintrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, rivaroxaban is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from \nanimals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore, rivaroxaban is contraindicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRivaroxaban has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like \nsyncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in phase \nIII studies \n \nIndication  \n \n \n\nNumber of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose Maximum \ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective \nhip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill patients 3,997 10 mg 39 days \n \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of \nrecurrence \n \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 months: \n10 mg or 20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation  \n\n7,750  \n \n\n20 mg  \n \n\n41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients after an acute coronary syndrome \n(ACS)  \n \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, \nco-administered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\n\n\n35 \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with CAD/PAD  \n\n18,244  \n \n\n5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone  \n\n47 months  \n\n*Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of adverse \nreactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data were not \nincluded for frequency calculation in this table.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of rivaroxaban may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post \nhaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \n“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, \ngastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and \nanaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA \ntreatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of \nhaemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical \nrelevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in \ncertain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on \nconcomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual \nbleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, \npaleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some \ncases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris \nhave been observed. \n\n\n\n38 \n\nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for rivaroxaban. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above. \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). The use of activated \ncharcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \n \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor \nXa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. \nDepending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert should be considered in case \nof major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n39 \n\nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. In patients undergoing major orthopaedic \nsurgery, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 – 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of \nmaximum effect) ranged from 13 to 25 s (baseline values before surgery 12 to 15 s). \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-factor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPrevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of VTE, i.e. proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism \n(PE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs. Over 9,500 patients (7,050 \nin total hip replacement surgery and 2,531 in total knee replacement surgery) were studied in \ncontrolled randomised double-blind phase III clinical studies, the RECORD-programme. \nRivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (od) started no sooner than 6 hours post-operatively was compared \nwith enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours pre-operatively. \nIn all three phase III studies (see table 4), rivaroxaban significantly reduced the rate of total VTE (any \nvenographically detected or symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE and death) and major VTE (proximal \nDVT, non-fatal PE and VTE-related death), the pre-specified primary and major secondary efficacy \nendpoints. Furthermore, in all three studies the rate of symptomatic VTE (symptomatic DVT, nonfatal \nPE, VTE-related death) was lower in rivaroxaban treated patients compared to patients treated with \nenoxaparin. \nThe main safety endpoint, major bleeding, showed comparable rates for patients treated with \nrivaroxaban 10 mg compared to enoxaparin 40 mg. \n \nTable 4: Efficacy and safety results from phase III clinical studies \n \n\n RECORD 1 RECORD 2 RECORD 3 \nStudy \npopulation \n\n4,541 patients undergoing \ntotal hip replacement surgery \n\n2,509 patients undergoing \ntotal hip replacement surgery \n\n2,531 patients undergoing total \nknee replacement surgery \n\nTreatment \ndose and \nduration \nafter \nsurgery \n\nRivaroxaban \n10 mg od \n\n35 ± 4 days \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg od \n\n35 ± 4 days \n\np Rivaroxaban \n10 mg od \n\n35 ± 4 days \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg od \n\n12 ± 2 days \n\np Rivaroxaban \n10 mg od \n\n12 ± 2 days \n\nEnoxaparin        \n40 mg od \n12 ± 2 \ndays \n\np \n\nTotal VTE 18 (1.1 %) 58 (3.7 %) < 0.001 17 (2.0 %) 81 (9.3 %) < 0.001 79 (9.6 %) 166 < 0.001 \n\n\n\n40 \n\n(18.9 %)  \nMajor VTE 4 (0.2 %) 33 (2.0 %) < 0.001 6 (0.6 %) 49 (5.1 %) < 0.001 9 (1.0 %) 24 \n\n(2.6 %)      \n0.01 \n\nSymptomatic \nVTE \n\n6 (0.4 %) 11 (0.7 %) 3 (0.4 %) 15 (1.7 %) 8 (1.0 %) 24 (2.7 %) \n\nMajor \nbleedings \n\n6 (0.3 %) 2 (0.1 %) 1 (0.1 %) 1 (0.1 %) 7 (0.6 %) 6 (0.5 %) \n\n \nThe analysis of the pooled results of the phase III studies corroborated the data obtained in the \nindividual studies regarding reduction of total VTE, major VTE and symptomatic VTE with \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily. \n \nIn addition to the phase III RECORD programme, a post-authorization, non-interventional, open-label \ncohort study (XAMOS) has been conducted in 17,413 patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery \nof the hip or knee, to compare rivaroxaban with other pharmacological thromboprophylaxis \n(standard-of-care) under real-life setting. Symptomatic VTE occurred in 57 (0.6 %) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n=8,778) and 88 (1.0 %) of patients in the standard-of-care group (n=8,635; HR \n0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91); safety population). Major bleeding occurred in 35 (0.4%) and 29 (0.3%) of \npatients in the rivaroxaban and standard-of-care groups (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.67-1.80). Thus, the results \nwere consistent with the results of the pivotal randomised studies. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator.  \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo. \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed \n6-12 months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio \nHR: 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit \n(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95 % CI: \n0.47 - 0.95), nominal p value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the \ntherapeutic range a mean of 60.3 % of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and \n55.4 %, 60.1 %, and 62.8 % of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration \ngroups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of \nmean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the \nincidence of the recurrent VTE (P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to \ncentre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \nTable 5: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population   3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \nTreatment dose and duration Rivaroxabana) \n\n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 \n(2.1 %) \n\n51 \n(3.0 %) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 20 \n(1.2 %) \n\n18 \n(1.0 %) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent DVT 14 \n(0.8 %) \n\n28 \n(1.6 %) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 \n(0.1 %) \n\n0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2 %) \n\n6 \n(0.3 %) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant \nnon-major bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1 %) \n\n138 \n(8.1 %) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 \n(0.8 %) \n\n20 \n(1.2 %) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 – 1.684)).

A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for \nmeasured baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. \nAdjusted HRs comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and \nall-cause mortality were 0.77 (95 % CI 0.40-1.50), 0.91 (95 % CI 0.54-1.54) and 0.51 (95 % CI \n0.24-1.07), respectively. These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety \nprofile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I \nantibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess \nof events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were \nrandomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) \nand 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0- 3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to \nrivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients \nrandomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 \npatients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \nprevention of thromboembolic events (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2-4 hours after tablet \nintake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80-100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can \nbe taken with or without food. Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about \n15 mg once daily. At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability and decreased absorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state \nthan in fed state. Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual \nvariability (CV %) ranging from 30 % to 40 %, apart from on the day of surgery and the following day \nwhen variability in exposure is high (70 %). \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29 % \nand 56 % decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92 % to 95 %, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \n\n\n\n46 \n\nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5-fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25 %). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2-fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3-fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6--fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT. \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6-fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \n \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for prevention of VTE 10 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90 % prediction interval) 2-4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 101 (7-273) and 14 \n(4-51) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5-30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \n\n\n\n47 \n\nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. In patients, baseline factor Xa and PT were \ninfluenced by the surgery resulting in a difference in the concentration-PT slope between the day \npostsurgery and steady state. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre-and postnatal \nstudy in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes \nmellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose. \n \nTherapy with Rivaroxaban Accord should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention \nof stroke and systemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord immediately and continue on the \nfollowing day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the \nsame day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, \na dose of rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1-21 15 mg twice daily 30 mg \nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily 20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nFollowing  \ncompletion of at \nleast 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or \nPE \n\n10 mg once daily \nor 20 mg once \ndaily \n\n10 mg \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Rivaroxaban Accord for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1-21), the patient should take \nRivaroxaban Accord immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg rivaroxaban per day. In this case two \n15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily \nintake as recommended on the following day. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord \nimmediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose \nshould not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to rivaroxaban \nFor patients treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, VKA treatment should be \nstopped and Rivaroxaban Accord therapy should be initiated when the International Normalised Ratio \n(INR) is ≤ 3.0. \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nRivaroxaban Accord therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, INR values will be falsely elevated after the \nintake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and \ntherefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from rivaroxaban to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that rivaroxaban can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from rivaroxaban to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \n≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both rivaroxaban and VKA \nthe INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nrivaroxaban. Once Rivaroxaban Accord is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least \n24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to rivaroxaban \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the \nparenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of \n\n\n\n51 \n\ndiscontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous \nunfractionated heparin). \nConverting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban \nAccord is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine \nclearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15-29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial \n\nfibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, patients \n\nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the \nrecommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to \n15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs \nthe risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK \nmodelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary. \n\n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50-80 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nRivaroxaban Accord is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy \nand clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for use in children below \n18 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nRivaroxaban Accord can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion.  \nFor transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated \nwith anticoagulants, Rivaroxaban Accord treatment should be started at least 4 hours before \ncardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, \nconfirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Rivaroxaban Accord as \nprescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should take established guideline \nrecommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion into account. \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) \nwith stent placement \nThere is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban once daily (or 10 mg rivaroxaban \nonce daily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min]) in \naddition to a P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation who require oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is for oral use. \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may be crushed and \nmixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the \nadministration of crushed Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be \nimmediately followed by food. \nThe crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of \nthe correct gastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount \nof water via a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water. After the administration of \ncrushed Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be immediately \nfollowed by enteral feeding (see section 5.2 and 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \n \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Accord are to be carefully observed for \nsigns of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of \nhaemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Accord administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage \noccurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nRivaroxaban Accord is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min. Use \nis not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nRivaroxaban Accord should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nThe use of Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic \ntreatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors \nof both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a \nclinically relevant degree (2.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \n \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\n\n\n54 \n\n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \n \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been \nstudied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that rivaroxaban \nprovides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Rivaroxaban Accord is \nnot recommended for these patients. \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \n \nClinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy \nin this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a \nhistory of stroke/ transient ischaemic attack (TIA). \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with \npulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta \n2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \n \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 15 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \n\n\n\n55 \n\nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x \nhalf-life, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the \nlast administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention \n \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg should be \nstopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician. \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nRivaroxaban Accord should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as \ndetermined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \n \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \n \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6-fold / 2.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7-fold / 1.6-fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in \nhigh-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \n \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response. \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \n \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or \nnon-major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \n \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, \nanti-factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On \n\n\n\n57 \n\nthe fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50 % decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the \nintrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Rivaroxaban Accord is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from \nanimals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Accord is \ncontraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRivaroxaban has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like \nsyncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in phase \nIII studies \nIndication  \n \n \n\nNumber of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose Maximum \ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective \nhip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism in \nmedically ill patients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of \nrecurrence \n \n\n6,790 Day 1-21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least \n6 months: 10 mg or \n20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation  \n\n7,750  \n \n\n20 mg  \n \n\n41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients after an (ACS)  \n \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, \nco-administered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with CAD/PAD  \n \n\n18,244  \n \n\n5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone  \n\n47 months  \n \n\n \n*Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of adverse \nreactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data were not \nincluded for frequency calculation in this table.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of rivaroxaban may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post \nhaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \n“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, \ngastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and \nanaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA \ntreatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of \nhaemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical \nrelevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in \ncertain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on \nconcomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual \nbleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, \npaleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some \ncases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris \nhave been observed. \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for rivaroxaban. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above. \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). The use of activated \ncharcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n62 \n\nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor \nXa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. \nDepending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert should be considered in case \nof major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2-4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for  \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8-16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from 14 \nto 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18-30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1-4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16-36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from \n\n\n\n63 \n\n12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 to \n26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-factor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. \nIn the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to rivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or to warfarin \ntitrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment was \n19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  \n34.9 % of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4 % were treated with class III \nantiarrhythmic including amiodarone. \n \nRivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred \nin 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71 % per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16 % per year) (HR 0.79; \n95 % CI, 0.66-0.96; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according \nto ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12 % per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42 % \nper year) (HR 0.88; 95 % CI, 0.74-1.03; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.117 for superiority). \nResults for secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in \nTable 4. \nAmong patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a \nmean of 55 % of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did \nnot differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0-3.0) in the equally sized \nquartiles (P=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ration \n(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.49-1.12). \nThe incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding \nevents) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population  ITT analyses of efficacy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 20 mg od \n\n(15 mg od in patients \nwith moderate renal \nimpairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin titrated to a \ntarget INR of 2.5 \n(therapeutic range 2.0 \nto 3.0) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95 % CI) \np-value, test for \nsuperiority \n\nStroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \n\n269 \n(2.12) \n \n\n306 \n(2.42) \n\n0.88 \n(0.74-1.03) \n0.117 \n\nStroke, non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \nand vascular death \n\n572 \n(4.51) \n\n609 \n(4.81) \n\n0.94 \n(0.84-1.05) \n0.265 \n\nStroke, non-CNS 659 709 0.93 \n\n\n\n64 \n\nsystemic embolism, \nvascular death and \nmyocardial infarction \n\n(5.24) (5.65) (0.83-1.03) \n0.158 \n\nStroke 253 \n(1.99) \n\n281 \n(2.22) \n\n0.90 \n(0.76-1.07) \n0.221 \n\nNon-CNS systemic \nembolism \n\n20 \n(0.16) \n\n27 \n(0.21) \n\n0.74 \n(0.42-1.32) \n0.308 \n\nMyocardial infarction 130 \n(1.02) \n\n142 \n(1.11) \n\n0.91 \n(0.72-1.16) \n0.464 \n\n \nTable 5: Safety results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillationa) \nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 20 mg \n\nonce a day (15 mg once \na day in patients with \nmoderate renal \nimpairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin titrated to a \ntarget INR of 2.5 \n(therapeutic  range \n2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\n \n \nHR (95% CI) \np-value \n\nMajor and non-major \nclinically relevant bleeding \nevents \n\n1,475 \n(14.91) \n\n1,449 \n(14.52) \n\n1.03 (0.96-1.11) \n0.442 \n\nMajor bleeding events 395 \n(3.60) \n\n386 \n(3.45) \n\n1.04 (0.90-1.20) \n0.576 \n\nDeath due to bleeding*  \n \n\n27 \n(0.24) \n\n55 \n(0.48) \n\n0.50 (0.31-0.79) \n0.003 \n\nCritical organ bleeding* 91 \n(0.82) \n\n133 \n(1.18) \n\n0.69 (0.53-0.91) \n0.007 \n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage* \n\n55 \n(0.49) \n\n84 \n(0.74) \n\n0.67 (0.47-0.93) \n0.019 \n\nHaemoglobin drop* 305 \n(2.77) \n\n254 \n(2.26) \n\n1.22 (1.03-1.44) \n0.019 \n\nTransfusion of 2 or \nmore units of packed \nred blood cells or whole \nblood* \n\n183 \n(1.65) \n\n149 \n(1.32) \n\n1.25 (1.01-1.55) \n0.044 \n\nNon-major clinically \nrelevant bleeding events \n\n1,185 \n(11.80) \n\n1,151 \n(11.37) \n\n1.04 (0.96-1.13) \n0.345 \n\nAll-cause mortality 208 \n(1.87) \n\n250 \n(2.21) \n\n0.85 (0.70-1.02) \n0.073 \n\na) Safety population, on treatment \n* Nominally significant \n \nIn addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorization, \nnoninterventional, open label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including \nthromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) \nsystemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in \nXANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, \nrespectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in \n0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS \nsystemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years. \nThese observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this \nindication. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \n \nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint \nevaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with  \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted \nVKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1-5 days of \npretreatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were \nemployed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5 %) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0 %) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95 % CI \n0.15-1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 \n(0.6 %) and 4 (0.8 %) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively \n(RR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy \nand safety between rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \n \nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients \nwith non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary \natherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients \nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of \nstroke or TIA were excluded. \nGroup 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine \nclearance 30-49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus \nDAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose \nacetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for \nsubjects with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received \ndose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose adjusted VKA plus low-dose \nASA. \nThe primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7 %), 117 \n(16.6 %), and 167 (24.0 %) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95 % CI \n0.47-0.76; p < 0.001, and HR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.50-0.80; p < 0.001, respectively). The secondary \nendpoint (composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9 %), 36 \n(5.1 %), and 36 (5.2 %) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the \nrivaroxaban regimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events \ncompared to the VKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI \nwith stent placement. \nThe primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including \nthromboembolic events) in this population are limited. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator.  \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo. \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality. \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443-1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95 % CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of \n60.3 % of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4 %, 60.1 %, and 62.8 % of the \ntime in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the \nenoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in \nTarget INR Range of  2.0-3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE \n(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban \nversus warfarin was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.35-1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population   3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \nTreatment dose and duration Rivaroxabana) \n\n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 \n(2.1 %) \n\n51 \n(3.0 %) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 20 \n(1.2 %) \n\n18 \n(1.0 %) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent DVT 14 \n(0.8 %) \n\n28 \n(1.6 %) \n\n\n\n67 \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 \n(0.1 %) \n\n0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE cannot \nbe ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2 %) \n\n6 \n(0.3 %) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant \nnon-major bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1 %) \n\n138 \n(8.1 %) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 \n(0.8 %) \n\n20 \n(1.2 %) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443-1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749-1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding \nevents) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95 % CI: 0.633-1.139), nominal p value p= 0.275). INR \nvalues were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63 % of the time for the mean treatment duration \nof 215 days, and 57 %, 62 %, and 65 % of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment \nduration groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the \nlevel of mean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0-3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the \nincidence of the recurrent VTE (p=0.082 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to \ncentre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: 0.277-1.484). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3 % (249/2412)) than in the \nenoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4 % (274/2405)).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer \nand renal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for \nmeasured baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. \nAdjusted HRs comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and \nall-cause mortality were 0.77 (95 % CI 0.40-1.50), 0.91 (95 % CI 0.54-1.54) and 0.51 (95 % CI \n0.24-1.07), respectively. These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety \nprofile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I \nantibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess \nof events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were \nrandomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) \nand 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0- 3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to \nrivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients \nrandomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 \npatients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \nprevention of thromboembolic events (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2-4 hours after tablet \nintake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80-100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66 % was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39 % were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are \nto be taken with food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose. \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV %) \nranging from 30 % to 40 %. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29 % \nand 56 % decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92 % to 95 %, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5-fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25 %). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2-fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3-fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6-fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT. \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min), \n\n\n\n72 \n\nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6-fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \n \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90 % prediction interval) 2-4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22-535) and 32 \n(6-239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5-30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre-and postnatal \nstudy in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes \nmellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose. \n \nTherapy with Rivaroxaban Accord should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention \nof stroke and systemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord immediately and continue on the \nfollowing day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the \nsame day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \n\n\n\n76 \n\ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE. \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Accord 10 mg \nonce daily, a dose of Rivaroxaban Accord 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1-21 15 mg twice daily 30 mg \nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily 20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nFollowing  \ncompletion of at \nleast 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or \nPE \n\n10 mg once daily \nor 20 mg once \ndaily \n\n10 mg \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Rivaroxaban Accord for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1-21), the patient should take \nRivaroxaban Accord immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg rivaroxaban per day. In this case two \n15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily \nintake as recommended on the following day. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord \nimmediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose \nshould not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to rivaroxaban \nFor patients treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, VKA treatment should be \nstopped and Rivaroxaban Accord therapy should be initiated when the International Normalised Ratio \n(INR) is ≤ 3.0. \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nRivaroxaban Accord therapy should be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, INR values will be falsely elevated after the \nintake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and \ntherefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from rivaroxaban to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that rivaroxaban can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from rivaroxaban to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \n≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both rivaroxaban and VKA \nthe INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nrivaroxaban. Once Rivaroxaban Accord is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least \n24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to rivaroxaban \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the \nparenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of \ndiscontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous \nunfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban \nAccord is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine \nclearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15-29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial \n\nfibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, patients \n\nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the \nrecommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg \nonce daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and \nhas not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). When the \nrecommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended dose is \nnecessary. \n\n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50-80 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nRivaroxaban Accord is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy \nand clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for use in children below \n18 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nRivaroxaban Accord can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion.  \nFor transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated \nwith anticoagulants, Rivaroxaban Accord treatment should be started at least 4 hours before \ncardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, \nconfirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Rivaroxaban Accord as \nprescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should take established guideline \nrecommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) \nwith stent placement \nThere is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban once daily (or 10 mg rivaroxaban \nonce daily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min]) in \naddition to a P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation who require oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is for oral use. \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may be crushed and \nmixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the \nadministration of crushed Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be \nimmediately followed by food. \nThe crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of \nthe correct gastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount \nof water via a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water. After the administration of \ncrushed Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be immediately \nfollowed by enteral feeding (see section 5.2 and 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \n \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Accord are to be carefully observed for \nsigns of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of \nhaemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Accord administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage \noccurs. (see section 4.9) \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nRivaroxaban Accord is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min. Use \nis not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nRivaroxaban Accord should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nThe use of Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic \ntreatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors \nof both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a \nclinically relevant degree (2.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \n \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\n\n\n80 \n\n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \n \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been \nstudied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that rivaroxaban \nprovides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Rivaroxaban Accord is \nnot recommended for these patients. \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \n \nClinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy \nin this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a \nhistory of stroke/ transient ischaemic attack (TIA). \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with \npulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 2-\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \n \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \n\n\n\n81 \n\nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last \nadministration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention \n \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Accord 20 mg should be \nstopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician. \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nRivaroxaban Accord should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as \ndetermined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \n \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \n \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium- free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6-fold / 2.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7-fold / 1.6-fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in \nhigh-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \n \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response. \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \n \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or \nnon-major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \n \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, \nanti-factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On \nthe fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban. \n\n\n\n83 \n\nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50 % decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the \nintrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, rivaroxaban is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from \nanimals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore, rivaroxaban is contraindicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRivaroxaban has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like \nsyncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication  \n \n \n\nNumber of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose Maximum \ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective \nhip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill patients 3,997 10 mg 39 days \n \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of \nrecurrence \n \n\n6,790 Day 1-21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least \n6 months: 10 mg or \n20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation  \n\n7,750  \n \n\n20 mg  \n \n\n41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients after an acute coronary syndrome \n(ACS)  \n \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, \nco-administered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with CAD/PAD  \n \n\n18,244  \n \n\n5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone  \n\n47 months  \n \n\n \n*Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see  \nsection 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of adverse \nreactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data were not \nincluded for frequency calculation in this table.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of rivaroxaban may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post \nhaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \n“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, \ngastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and \nanaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA \ntreatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of \nhaemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical \nrelevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in \ncertain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on \nconcomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual \nbleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, \npaleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some \ncases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris \nhave been observed. \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for rivaroxaban. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above. \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). The use of activated \ncharcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \n \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n88 \n\nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor \nXa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent , such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. \nDepending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert should be considered in case \nof major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2-4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8-16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from 14 \nto 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18-30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1-4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16-36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from \n12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 to \n26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \n\n\n\n89 \n\nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-factor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nThe rivaroxaban clinical program was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. \nIn the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to rivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or to warfarin \ntitrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment was \n19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months. 34.9 % of patients were treated with \nacetylsalicylic acid and 11.4 % were treated with class III antiarrhythmic including amiodarone. \n \nRivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred \nin 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71 % per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16 % per year) (HR 0.79; \n95 % CI, 0.66-0.96; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according \nto ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12 % per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42 % \nper year) (HR 0.88; 95 % CI, 0.74-1.03; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.117 for superiority). \nResults for secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in \nTable 4. \nAmong patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a \nmean of 55 % of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did \nnot differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0-3.0) in the equally sized \nquartiles (P=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ration \n(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.49-1.12). \nThe incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding \nevents) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population  ITT analyses of efficacy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 20 mg od \n\n(15 mg od in patients \nwith moderate renal \nimpairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin titrated to a \ntarget INR of 2.5 \n(therapeutic range 2.0 \nto 3.0) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95 % CI) \np-value, test for \nsuperiority \n\nStroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \n\n269 \n(2.12) \n \n\n306 \n(2.42) \n\n0.88 \n(0.74-1.03) \n0.117 \n\nStroke, non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \nand vascular death \n\n572 \n(4.51) \n\n609 \n(4.81) \n\n0.94 \n(0.84-1.05) \n0.265 \n\nStroke, non-CNS \nsystemic embolism, \nvascular death and \nmyocardial infarction \n\n659 \n(5.24) \n\n709 \n(5.65) \n\n0.93 \n(0.83-1.03) \n0.158 \n\nStroke 253 \n(1.99) \n\n281 \n(2.22) \n\n0.90 \n(0.76-1.07) \n0.221 \n\n\n\n90 \n\nNon-CNS systemic \nembolism \n\n20 \n(0.16) \n\n27 \n(0.21) \n\n0.74 \n(0.42-1.32) \n0.308 \n\nMyocardial infarction 130 \n(1.02) \n\n142 \n(1.11) \n\n0.91 \n(0.72-1.16) \n0.464 \n\n \nTable 5: Safety results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillationa) \nTreatment dose Rivaroxaban 20 mg \n\nonce a day (15 mg once \na day in patients with \nmoderate renal \nimpairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin titrated to a \ntarget INR of 2.5 \n(therapeutic  range \n2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\n \n \nHR (95% CI) \np-value \n\nMajor and non-major \nclinically relevant bleeding \nevents \n\n1,475 \n(14.91) \n\n1,449 \n(14.52) \n\n1.03 (0.96-1.11) \n0.442 \n\nMajor bleeding events 395 \n(3.60) \n\n386 \n(3.45) \n\n1.04 (0.90-1.20) \n0.576 \n\nDeath due to bleeding*  \n \n\n27 \n(0.24) \n\n55 \n(0.48) \n\n0.50 (0.31-0.79) \n0.003 \n\nCritical organ bleeding* 91 \n(0.82) \n\n133 \n(1.18) \n\n0.69 (0.53-0.91) \n0.007 \n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage* \n\n55 \n(0.49) \n\n84 \n(0.74) \n\n0.67 (0.47-0.93) \n0.019 \n\nHaemoglobin drop* 305 \n(2.77) \n\n254 \n(2.26) \n\n1.22 (1.03-1.44) \n0.019 \n\nTransfusion of 2 or \nmore units of packed red \nblood cells or whole \nblood* \n\n183 \n(1.65) \n\n149 \n(1.32) \n\n1.25 (1.01-1.55) \n0.044 \n\nNon-major clinically \nrelevant bleeding events \n\n1,185 \n(11.80) \n\n1,151 \n(11.37) \n\n1.04 (0.96-1.13) \n0.345 \n\nAll-cause mortality 208 \n(1.87) \n\n250 \n(2.21) \n\n0.85 (0.70-1.02) \n0.073 \n\na) Safety population, on treatment \n* Nominally significant \n \nIn addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorization, \nnoninterventional, open label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including \nthromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) \nsystemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in \nXANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, \nrespectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in \n0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS \nsystemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years. \nThese observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this \nindication. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \n \nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint \nevaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted \nVKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1-5 days of \n\n\n\n91 \n\npretreatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were \nemployed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5 %) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0 %) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95 % CI \n0.15-1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 \n(0.6 %) and 4 (0.8 %) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively \n(RR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy \nand safety between rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \n \nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients \nwith non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary \natherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients \nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of \nstroke or TIA were excluded. \nGroup 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine \nclearance 30-49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus \nDAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose \nacetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for \nsubjects with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received \ndose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose adjusted VKA plus low-dose \nASA. \nThe primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7 %), 117 \n(16.6 %), and 167 (24.0 %) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95 % CI \n0.47-0.76; p < 0.001, and HR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.50-0.80; p < 0.001, respectively). The secondary \nendpoint (composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9 %), 36 \n(5.1 %), and 36 (5.2 %) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the \nrivaroxaban regimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events \ncompared to the VKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI \nwith stent placement. \nThe primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including \nthromboembolic events) in this population are limited. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator.  \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \n\n\n\n92 \n\nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo. \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality. \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed \n6-12 months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443-1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95 % CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of \n60.3 % of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4 %, 60.1 %, and 62.8 % of the \ntime in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the \nenoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in \nTarget INR Range of 2.0-3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE \n(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban \nversus warfarin was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.35-1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population   3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nRivaroxabana) 3, 6 or \n12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) 3, 6 or \n12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 (2.1 %) \n51 \n(3.0 %) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 20 (1.2 %) \n18 \n(1.0 %) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent DVT 14 (0.8 %) \n28 \n(1.6 %) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 (0.1 %) \n0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE cannot \nbe ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2 %) \n\n6 \n(0.3 %) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant \nnon-major bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1 %) \n\n138 \n(8.1 %) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 (0.8 %) \n20 \n(1.2 %) \n\n\n\n93 \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443-1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); hazard ratio: \n1.123 (0.749-1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major \nbleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95 % CI: 0.633-1.139), nominal p value p= 0.275). \nINR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63 % of the time for the mean treatment \nduration of 215 days, and 57 %, 62 %, and 65 % of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended \ntreatment duration groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation \nbetween the level of mean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0-3.0) in the equally sized \ntertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE (p=0.082 for interaction). Within the highest tertile \naccording to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: 0.277-1.484). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3 % (249/2412)) than in the \nenoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4 % (274/2405)).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer \nand renal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for \nmeasured baseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. \nAdjusted HRs comparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and \nall-cause mortality were 0.77 (95 % CI 0.40-1.50), 0.91 (95 % CI 0.54-1.54) and 0.51 (95 % CI \n0.24-1.07), respectively. These results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety \nprofile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I \nantibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess \nof events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were \nrandomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) \nand 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0- 3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to \nrivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients \nrandomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 \npatients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \nprevention of thromboembolic events (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2-4 hours after tablet \nintake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80-100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66 % was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39 % were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are \nto be taken with food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose. \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV %) \nranging from 30 % to 40 %. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29 % \nand 56 % decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92 % to 95 %, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \n\n\n\n97 \n\nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5-fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25 %). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2-fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3-fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6-fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT. \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6-fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n98 \n\nPharmacokinetic data in patients \n \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90 % prediction interval) 2-4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22-535) and 32 \n(6-239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5-30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre-and postnatal \nstudy in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE. \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Rivaroxaban Accord 10 mg \nonce daily, a dose of Rivaroxaban Accord 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1-21 15 mg twice daily 30 mg \nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily 20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nFollowing  \ncompletion of at \nleast 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or \nPE \n\n10 mg once daily \nor 20 mg once \ndaily \n\n10 mg \nor 20 mg \n\n \nThe 4-week treatment initiation pack of Rivaroxaban Accord is dedicated to patients who will \ntransition from 15 mg twice daily to 20 mg once daily from Day 22 onwards (see section 6.5). \nFor patients with moderate or severe renal impairment where the decision has been taken for 15 mg \nonce daily from Day 22 onwards, other pack sizes only containing 15 mg film-coated tablets are \navailable (see dosing instructions in section “Special populations” below). \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1-21), the patient should take \nRivaroxaban Accord immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg rivaroxaban per day. In this case two \n15 mg tablets may be taken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily \nintake as recommended on the following day. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Rivaroxaban Accord \nimmediately, and continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose \nshould not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to rivaroxaban \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nRivaroxaban Accord therapy should be initiated once the International Normalised Ration (INR) is \n≤ 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, INR values will be falsely elevated after the \nintake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and \ntherefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from rivaroxaban to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that rivaroxaban can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from rivaroxaban to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \n≥ 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both rivaroxaban and VKA \nthe INR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nrivaroxaban. Once Rivaroxaban Accord is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least \n24 hours after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to rivaroxaban \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the \nparenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of \ndiscontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous \nunfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken. \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Rivaroxaban \nAccord is to be used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine \nclearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15-29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, patients \n\nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks.  \nThereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from \n20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for \nbleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of \n15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). When the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment \nfrom the recommended dose is necessary. \n\n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 \nml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nRivaroxaban Accord is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy \nand clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. Therefore, Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for use in children below \n18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is for oral use. \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may be crushed and \nmixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the \nadministration of crushed Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be \nimmediately followed by food. \nThe crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after confirmation of \nthe correct gastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet should be administered in a small amount \nof water via a gastric tube after which it should be flushed with water. After the administration of \ncrushed Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be immediately \nfollowed by enteral feeding (see section 5.2 and 6.6). \n \n\n\n\n104 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Rivaroxaban Accord are to be carefully observed for \nsigns of bleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of \nhaemorrhage. Rivaroxaban Accord administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage \noccurs. (see section 4.9) \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nRivaroxaban Accord is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/min. Use \nis not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n105 \n\nRivaroxaban Accord should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nThe use of Rivaroxaban Accord is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic \ntreatment with azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and \nposaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors \nof both CYP3A4 and P-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a \nclinically relevant degree (2.6-fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \n \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n• congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n• uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n• other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n• vascular retinopathy \n• bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \n \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been \nstudied in patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that rivaroxaban \nprovides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Rivaroxaban Accord is \nnot recommended for these patients. \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \n \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with \npulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta \n2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \n \n\n\n\n106 \n\nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x \nhalf-life, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the \nlast administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention \n \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Rivaroxaban Accord 15/20 mg should be \nstopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician. \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nRivaroxaban Accord should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as \ndetermined by the treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \n \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \n \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n  \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6-fold / 2.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7-fold / 1.6-fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in \nCmax. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3-fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0-fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6-fold increase in Cmax when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4- fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3- fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in \nhigh-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \n \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response. \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nSSRIs/SNRIs \n \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or \nnon-major clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \n \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, \nanti-factor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On \nthe fourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity and ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban. \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the Ctrough of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \n \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50 % decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the \nintrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, rivaroxaban is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from \nanimals indicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore, rivaroxaban is contraindicated \n\n\n\n109 \n\nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRivaroxaban has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like \nsyncope (frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies including 53,103 patients \nexposed to rivaroxaban (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in \nphase III studies \nIndication  \n \n \n\nNumber of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose Maximum \ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective \nhip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill patients 3,997 10 mg 39 days \n \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of \nrecurrence \n \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or 20 \nmg \n\n21 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation  \n\n7,750  \n \n\n20 mg  \n \n\n41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients after an acute coronary syndrome \n(ACS)  \n \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with CAD/PAD  \n \n\n18,244  \n \n\n5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone  \n\n47 months  \n \n\n*Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nalso section 4.4. and ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below) (Table 2).

As incidence of adverse \nreactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS study data were not \nincluded for frequency calculation in this table.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of rivaroxaban may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post \nhaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary \naccording to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \n“Management of bleeding”). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, \ngastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and \nanaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA \ntreatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of \nhaemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical \nrelevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in \ncertain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on \nconcomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 “Haemorrhagic risk”). Menstrual \nbleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, \npaleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some \ncases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris \nhave been observed. \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for rivaroxaban. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n113 \n\n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above. \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). The use of activated \ncharcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \n \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific factor \nXa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent,  such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa) \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. \nDepending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert should be considered in case \nof major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. \n\n\n\n114 \n\nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the \n5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) \nfor 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from \n15 to 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged \nfrom 14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough (16 \n- 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 12 \nto 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 to 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-factor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator.  \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (≥ 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo. \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality. \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 4) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of \n60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the \ntime in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the \nenoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in \nTarget INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE \n(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban \nversus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \nTable 4: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \nStudy population   3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis \nTreatment dose and duration Rivaroxabana) \n\n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* 36 \n(2.1%) \n\n51 \n(3.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE 20 \n(1.2%) \n\n18 \n(1.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent DVT 14 \n(0.8%) \n\n28 \n(1.6%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT 1 \n(0.1%) \n\n0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events 14 \n(0.8%) \n\n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); hazard ratio: \n1.123 (0.749 - 1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major \n\n\n\n116 \n\nbleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95% CI: 0.633 - 1.139), nominal p value \np= 0.275). INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of 63% of the time for the mean \ntreatment duration of 215 days, and 57%, 62%, and 65% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month \nintended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear \nrelation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally \nsized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE (p=0.082 for interaction). Within the highest \ntertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.642 (95% CI: \n0.277 - 1.484). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) were slightly lower in the rivaroxaban treatment group (10.3% (249/2412)) than in the \nenoxaparin/VKA treatment group (11.4% (274/2405)).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively. \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome  \n \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicenter study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I \nantibodies). The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of 120 patients due to an excess \nof events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. 59 patients were \nrandomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min) \nand 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0- 3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in 12% of patients randomised to \nrivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No events were reported in patients \nrandomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of the rivaroxaban group and 2 \npatients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in the treatment of thromboembolic events. \n\n\n\n119 \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing rivaroxaban in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \nprevention of thromboembolic events (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or Cmax at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are \nto be taken with food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose. \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with Vss being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \n\n\n\n120 \n\nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5-fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25 %). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2-fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3-fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6-fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT. \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6-fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban Accord is to \nbe used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \n \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \n\n\n\n121 \n\nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and 32 \n(6 - 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an Emax model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been established for children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre-and postnatal \nstudy in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

Since rivaroxaban \nabsorption is dependent on the site of drug release, avoid administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach which can result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced drug exposure. After the \nadministration of a crushed rivaroxaban 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should then be immediately \nfollowed by enteral feeding. Enteral feeding is not required following administration of the 2.5 mg or \n10 mg tablets. \n \nCrushed rivaroxaban tablets are stable in water and in apple sauce for up to 4 hours. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n \n \n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nAccord Healthcare S.L.U. \nWorld Trade Center, Moll de Barcelona s/n, Edifici Est, 6a Planta,  \nBarcelona, 08039 \nSpain \n \n \n8 MARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S) \n \nEU/1/20/1488/039 \n \n \n9 DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION \n \nDate of first authorisation: \n \n \n10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \n \n\n\n\n123 \n\nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \n\nA.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rivaroxaban Accord is and what it is used for \n \nYou have been given Rivaroxaban Accord because  \n\n- you have been diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions that \nincludes heart attack and unstable angina, a severe type of chest pain) and have been \nshown to have had an increase in certain cardiac blood tests. \nRivaroxaban Accord reduces the risk in adults of having another heart attack or reduces \nthe risk of dying from a disease related to your heart or your blood vessels. \nRivaroxaban Accord will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to \ntake either:  \n• acetylsalicylic acid or  \n• acetylsalicylic acid plus ticlopidine.  \n\n \nor  \n\n \n- you have been diagnosed with a high risk of getting a blood clot due to a coronary artery \n\ndisease or peripheral artery disease which causes symptoms. Rivaroxaban Accord reduces \nthe risk in adults of getting blot clots (atherothrombotic events). Rivaroxaban Accord will \nnot be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid.  \n\n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains the active substance rivaroxaban and belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus \nreducing the tendency of the blood to form clots. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Rivaroxaban Accord \n \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord \n- if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6) \n- if you are bleeding excessively \n\n\n\n167 \n\n- if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of \nserious bleeding (e.g., stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of \nthe brain or eyes) \n\n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open \n\n- if you have an acute coronary syndrome and previously had a bleeding or a blood clot in \nyour brain (stroke)  \n\n- if you have coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease and previously had a \nbleeding in your brain (stroke) or where there was a blockage of the small arteries providing \nblood to the brain’s deep tissues (lacunar stroke) or if you had a blood clot in your brain \n(ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke) in the previous month \n\n- if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- if you are pregnant or breast feeding \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rivaroxaban Accord. \nRivaroxaban Accord should not be used in combination with certain other medicines which reduce \nblood clotting such as prasugrel or ticagrelor other than acetylsalicylic acid and ticlopidine. \n \nTake special care with Rivaroxaban Accord \n• if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n• severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that \nworks in your body \n\n• if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section ‘Other medicines and \nRivaroxaban Accord’) \n\n• bleeding disorders \n• very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n• diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n• a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n• a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n• you are older than 75 years  \n• you weigh 60 kg or less  \n• you have a coronary artery disease with severe symptomatic heart failure  \n\n• if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n• if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Rivaroxaban Accord. Your doctor \nwill decide, if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer \nobservation. \n \nIf you need to have an operation: \n• it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Accord before and after the operation exactly at the \n\ntimes you have been told by your doctor. \n\n\n\n168 \n\n• If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for \nepidural or spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n• it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Accord before and after the injection or removal \n\nof the catheter exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n• tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough \ninformation on its use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Rivaroxaban Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n- If you are taking: \n\n• some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin  \n\n• ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol)  \n\n• some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin) \n• some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n• other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol prasugrel and ticagrelor (see section \n“Warnings and Precautions”)) \n\n• anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic \nacid) \n\n• dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n• some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)). \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Accord, because the \neffect of Rivaroxaban Accord may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with \nthis medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation. \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he may also \nuse a preventative ulcer treatment. \n \n- If you are taking: \n\n• some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n• St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n• rifampicin, an antibiotic \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Accord, \nbecause the effect of Rivaroxaban Accord may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you \nshould be treated with Rivaroxaban Accord and if you should be kept under closer \nobservation. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord if you are pregnant or breast feeding. If there is a chance that you \ncould become pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Rivaroxaban Accord. If you \nbecome pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide \nhow you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRivaroxaban Accord may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) \n(see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’). You should not drive or use machines if you are affected by \nthese symptoms. \n\n\n\n169 \n\n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to take Rivaroxaban Accord \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one 2.5 mg tablet twice a day. Take Rivaroxaban Accord around the same \ntime every day (for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). This medicine can be \ntaken with or without food. \n\n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nRivaroxaban Accord. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately \nbefore you take it. \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet through a stomach \ntube. \nIn case of enteral feeding, your doctor may crush and suspend rivaroxaban tablets in 50 mL of water \nand administer via a nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rivaroxaban Accord is and what it is used for \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to \n• prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation. Your doctor has \n\nprescribed this medicine for you because after an operation you are at an increased risk of \ngetting blood clots. \n\n• treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nRivaroxaban Accord belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by \nblocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Rivaroxaban Accord \n \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord \n• if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6) \n• if you are bleeding excessively \n• if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of \n\nserious bleeding (e.g., stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of \nthe brain or eyes) \n\n• if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open \n\n• if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n• if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rivaroxaban Accord. \n \n\n\n\n175 \n\nTake special care with Rivaroxaban Accord \n• if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n• moderate or severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the \namount of medicine that works in your body \n\n• if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section ‘Other medicines and \nRivaroxaban Accord’) \n\n• bleeding disorders \n• very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n• diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n• a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n• a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n• if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n• if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or \n\nsurgical procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. \n• if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Rivaroxaban Accord. Your doctor \nwill decide, if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer \nobservation. \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n• it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Accord before and after the operation exactly at the \n\ntimes you have been told by your doctor. \n• If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \no it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Accord exactly at the times you have been \n\ntold by your doctor \no tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or \n\nproblems with your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent \ncare is necessary. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough \ninformation on its use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Rivaroxaban Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIf you are taking \n• some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \n\nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin  \n• ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an excess of \n\ncortisol)  \n• some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin) \n• some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n\n\n\n176 \n\n• other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists \nsuch as warfarin and acenocoumarol) \n\n• anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n• dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n• some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin \n\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)). \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Accord, because the \neffect of Rivaroxaban Accord may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with \nthis medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation. \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he may also \nuse a preventative ulcer treatment. \n \nIf you are taking: \n• some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n• St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n• rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Accord, because the \neffect of Rivaroxaban Accord may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with \nRivaroxaban Accord and if you should be kept under closer observation. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord if you are pregnant or breast feeding. If there is a chance that you \ncould become pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Rivaroxaban Accord. If you \nbecome pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide \nhow you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRivaroxaban Accord may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) \n(see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’).

Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \n• To prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation  \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord 10 mg once a day.  \n \n• To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, \n\nand for preventing blood clots from re-occurring \nAfter at least 6 months blood clot treatment, the recommended dose is either one 10 mg tablet \nonce a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. Your doctor has prescribed you Rivaroxaban Accord \n10 mg once a day. \n\n \nSwallow the tablet preferably with water. \n\n\n\n177 \n\nTake Rivaroxaban Accord can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nRivaroxaban Accord. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately \nbefore you take it.  \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet through a stomach \ntube. \nIn case of enteral feeding, your doctor may crush and suspend rivaroxaban tablets in 50 mL of water \nand administer via a nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube. After the administration of a crushed \nrivaroxaban 15 mg or 20 tablet, enteral feeding is immediately followed.   \n \nCrushed rivaroxaban tablets are stable in water and in apple sauce for up to 4 hours.  \n \nWhen to take Rivaroxaban Accord \nTake the tablet every day until your doctor tells you to stop. \nTry to take the tablet at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment. \n \nTo prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation: \nTake the first tablet 6-10 hours after your operation. \nIf you have had a major hip operation you will usually take the tablets for 5 weeks. \nIf you have had a major knee operation you will usually take the tablets for 2 weeks. \n  \nIf you take more Rivaroxaban Accord than you should \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Accord tablets.

What Rivaroxaban Accord is and what it is used for \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to: \n• prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body if you have a form of \n\nirregular heart rhythm called non-valvular atrial fibrillation. \n• treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \n\nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nRivaroxaban Accord belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by \nblocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Rivaroxaban Accord \n \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord \n• if you are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6) \n• if you are bleeding excessively \n• if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of \n\nserious bleeding (e.g., stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of \nthe brain or eyes) \n\n• if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open \n\n• if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n• if you are pregnant or breast feeding \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rivaroxaban Accord. \n \n\n\n\n182 \n\nTake special care with Rivaroxaban Accord \n• if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: \n\n• severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that \nworks in your body \n\n• if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section ‘Other medicines and \nRivaroxaban Accord’) \n\n• bleeding disorders \n• very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment \n• diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet) e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n• a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy) \n• a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n• if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n• if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \n\nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. \n• if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Rivaroxaban Accord. Your doctor \nwill decide, if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer \nobservation. \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n• it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Accord before and after the operation exactly at the \n\ntimes you have been told by your doctor. \n• If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n• it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Accord before and after the injection or \n\nremoval of the catheter exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n• tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems with \n\nyour bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRivaroxaban Accord is not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough \ninformation on its use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Rivaroxaban Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIf you are taking \n• some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \n\nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n• ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing’s syndrome - when the body produces an excess of \n\ncortisol)  \n• some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin) \n• some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n• other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists \n\nsuch as warfarin and acenocoumarol) \n\n\n\n183 \n\n• anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n• dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n• some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin \n\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)). \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Accord, because the \neffect of Rivaroxaban Accord may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with \nthis medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation. \nIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he may also \nuse a preventative ulcer treatment. \n \nIf you are taking \n• some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n• St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n• rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Rivaroxaban Accord, because the \neffect of Rivaroxaban Accord may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with \nRivaroxaban Accord and if you should be kept under closer observation. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Rivaroxaban Accord if you are pregnant or breast feeding. If there is a chance that you \ncould become pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Rivaroxaban Accord. If you \nbecome pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide \nhow you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRivaroxaban Accord may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) \n(see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’). You should not drive or use machines if you are affected by \nthese symptoms. \n \nRivaroxaban Accord contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to take Rivaroxaban Accord \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYou must take Rivaroxaban Accord together with a meal. \nSwallow the tablet(s) preferably with water. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nRivaroxaban Accord. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately \nbefore you take it. This mixture should be immediately followed by food. \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Rivaroxaban Accord tablet through a stomach \ntube. \nIn case of enteral feeding, your doctor may crush and suspend rivaroxaban tablets in 50 mL of water \nand administer via a nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube. After the administration of a crushed \nrivaroxaban 15 mg or 20 tablet, enteral feeding is immediately followed. \n \nCrushed rivaroxaban tablets are stable in water and in apple sauce for up to 4 hours.  \n \n\n\n\n184 \n\nHow much to take \n• To prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body  \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord 20 mg once a day.  \nIf you have kidney problems, the dose may be reduced to one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg \nonce a day. \n \nIf you need a procedure to treat blocked blood vessels in your heart (called a percutaneous \ncoronary intervention - PCI with an insertion of a stent), there is limited evidence to reduce the \ndose to one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg once a day (or to one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord \n10 mg once a day in case your kidneys are not working properly) in addition to an antiplatelet \nmedicinal product such as clopidogrel. \n\n \n• To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, \n\nand for preventing blood clots from re-occurring.  \nThe recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord 15 mg twice a day for the first \n3 weeks. For treatment after 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord \n20 mg once a day.  \nAfter at least 6 months blood clot treatment your doctor may decide to continue treatment with \neither one 10 mg tablet once a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. \nIf you have kidney problems and take one tablet Rivaroxaban Accord 20 mg once a day, your \ndoctor may decide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 3 weeks to one tablet Rivaroxaban \nAccord 15 mg once a day if the risk for bleeding is greater than the risk for having another \nblood clot. \n\n \nWhen to take Rivaroxaban Accord \nTake the tablet(s) every day until your doctor tells you to stop. \nTry to take the tablet(s) at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment. \n \nTo prevent blood clots in the brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body: \nIf your heart beat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take \nRivaroxaban Accord at the times your doctor tells you. \n  \nIf you take more Rivaroxaban Accord than you should \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Accord tablets. Taking too \nmuch Rivaroxaban Accord increases the risk of bleeding. \n \nIf you forget to take Rivaroxaban Accord \n• If you are taking one 20 mg tablet or one 15 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take \n\nit as soon as you remember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a \nforgotten dose. Take the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet \nonce a day. \n\n• If you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \nremember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose \nyou can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. \n\nOn the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day. \n \nIf you stop taking Rivaroxaban Accord \nDo not stop taking Rivaroxaban Accord without talking to your doctor first, because Rivaroxaban \nAccord treats and prevents serious conditions. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n185 \n\n4.
