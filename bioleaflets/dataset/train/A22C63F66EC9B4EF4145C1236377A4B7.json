This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nANORO ELLIPTA 55 micrograms/22 micrograms inhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single inhalation provides a delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece) of 65 micrograms \numeclidinium bromide equivalent to 55 micrograms of umeclidinium and 22 micrograms of vilanterol (as \ntrifenatate). This corresponds to a pre-dispensed dose of 74.2 micrograms umeclidinium bromide equivalent \nto 62.5 micrograms umeclidinium and 25 micrograms vilanterol (as trifenatate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach delivered dose contains approximately 25 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). \n \nWhite powder in a light grey inhaler (ELLIPTA) with a red mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nANORO ELLIPTA is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult \npatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \n\nThe recommended dose is one inhalation of ANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms once daily.   \n \nANORO ELLIPTA should be administered at the same time of the day each day to maintain bronchodilation. \nThe maximum dose is one inhalation of ANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms once daily. \n \nSpecial populations  \n\nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The use of ANORO \n\n\n\n3 \n\nELLIPTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of ANORO ELLIPTA in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the \nindication of COPD. \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nANORO ELLIPTA is for inhalation use only. \n \nThe following instructions for the 30 dose inhaler (30 day supply) also apply to the 7 dose inhaler (7 day \nsupply). \n \nThe ELLIPTA inhaler contains pre-dispensed doses and is ready to use. \n \nThe inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant sachet \nshould be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. The patient should be advised to not \nopen the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose. \n \nThe inhaler will be in the \u2018closed\u2019 position when it is first taken out of its sealed tray. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date \nshould be written on the inhaler label in the space provided. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date is 6 weeks from the date \nof opening the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first \nopening. \n \nIf the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. The \nlost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled. \n \nIt is not possible to accidentally take extra medicinal product or a double dose in one inhalation. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \na) Prepare a dose \n \nOpen the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. \n \nSlide the cover down until a \u201cclick\u201d is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. \n \nThe dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the \u201cclick\u201d is \nheard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. \n \nb) How to inhale the medicinal product \n \nThe inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable. But not breathing out \ninto the inhaler. \n \nThe mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. The air \nvents should not be blocked with fingers during use. \n \n\n\u2022 Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as possible (at \nleast 3-4 seconds). \n\n\u2022 Remove the inhaler from the mouth. \n\u2022 Breathe out slowly and gently. \n\n \nThe medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThe mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. \n \nc) Close the inhaler \n \nSlide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAsthma \nUmeclidinium/vilanterol should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this \npatient population. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \nAdministration of umeclidinium/vilanterol may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-\nthreatening. Treatment with umeclidinium/vilanterol should be discontinued immediately if paradoxical \nbronchospasm occurs and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. \n \nNot for acute use  \nUmeclidinium/vilanterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.  \n \nDeterioration of disease \nIncreasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control. In the \nevent of deterioration of COPD during treatment with umeclidinium/vilanterol, a re-evaluation of the patient \nand of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken.  \n \nCardiovascular effects \nCardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after \nthe administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including \numeclidinium/vilanterol. Patients with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease were \nexcluded from clinical studies. Therefore, umeclidinium/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients \nwith severe cardiovascular disease. \n \nAntimuscarinic activity  \nConsistent with its antimuscarinic activity, umeclidinium/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients \nwith urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nHypokalaemia  \nBeta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the potential to \nproduce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring \nsupplementation.  \n \nNo clinically relevant effects of hypokalaemia were observed in clinical studies with umeclidinium/vilanterol \nat the recommended therapeutic dose. Caution should be exercised when umeclidinium/vilanterol is used \nwith other medicinal products that also have the potential to cause hypokalaemia (see section 4.5). \n \nHyperglycaemia \nBeta2-adrenergic agonists may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients.  \n \nNo clinically relevant effects on plasma glucose were observed in clinical studies with \numeclidinium/vilanterol at the recommended therapeutic dose. Upon initiation of treatment with \numeclidinium/vilanterol plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCoexisting conditions  \nUmeclidinium/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, \nand in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product. \n  \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBeta-adrenergic blockers \nMedicinal products containing beta-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of \nbeta2-adrenergic agonists, such as vilanterol. Concurrent use of either non-selective or selective \nbeta-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for their use. \n \nMetabolic and transporter based interactions  \nVilanterol is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin) may inhibit the \nmetabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, vilanterol. Co-administration with ketoconazole \n(400 mg) in healthy volunteers increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) and Cmax, 65% and 22% respectively. The \nincrease in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an increase in beta-adrenergic agonist related \nsystemic effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia method). Care \nis advised when co-administering umeclidinium/vilanterol with ketoconazole and other known strong \nCYP3A4 inhibitors as there is potential for an increased systemic exposure to vilanterol, which could lead to \nan increase in the potential for adverse reactions. Verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not \nsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol. \n \nUmeclidinium is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state pharmacokinetics of \numeclidinium was assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers). No effect on \numeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a 8-fold higher dose. An approximately 1.3-fold increase in \numeclidinium AUC was observed at 16-fold higher dose with no effect on umeclidinium Cmax. Based on the \nmagnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when umeclidinium/vilanterol \nis co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when administered to patients genetically deficient in \nCYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers). \n \nBoth umeclidinium and vilanterol are substrates of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp). The effect of the \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of \numeclidinium and vilanterol was assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on \numeclidinium or vilanterol Cmax. An approximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed \nwith no effect on vilanterol AUC. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug \ninteraction is expected when umeclidinium/vilanterol is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors. \n \nOther antimuscarinics and sympathomimetics \nCo-administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists, long-acting \nbeta2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing either of these agents has not been studied and is \nnot recommended as it may potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist or beta2-adrenergic agonist \nadverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.9). \n \nHypokalaemia \nConcomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-sparing \ndiuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, therefore use with \ncaution (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOther medicinal products for COPD \nAlthough no formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol \nhas been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short acting sympathomimetic \nbronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of drug interactions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of umeclidinium/vilanterol in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity at exposures which are not clinically relevant after administration of vilanterol \n(see section 5.3). \n \nUmeclidinium/vilanterol should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies \nthe potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether umeclidinium or vilanterol are excreted in human milk. However, other \nbeta2-adrenergic agonists are detected in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A \ndecision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue umeclidinium/vilanterol \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of umeclidinium/vilanterol on human fertility. Animal studies indicate no \neffects of umeclidinium or vilanterol on fertility.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUmeclidinium/vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction with umeclidinium/vilanterol was nasopharyngitis (9%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe safety profile of ANORO ELLIPTA is based on safety experience with umeclidinium/vilanterol and the \nindividual components from the clinical development program comprising of 6,855 patients with COPD and \nfrom spontaneous reporting. The clinical development programme included 2,354 patients who received \numeclidinium/vilanterol once daily in the Phase III clinical studies of 24 weeks or more, of whom 1,296 \npatients received the recommended dose of 55/22 micrograms in 24-week studies, 832 patients received a \nhigher dose of 113/22 micrograms in 24-week studies and 226 patients received 113/22 micrograms in a \n12-month study. \n \nThe frequencies assigned to the adverse reactions identified in the table below include crude incidence rates \nobserved in the integration of five 24-week studies and in the 12-month safety study.  \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions \n \n\nFrequency \n\nInfections and infestations Urinary tract infection  \nSinusitis \nNasopharyngitis \nPharyngitis \nUpper respiratory tract infection \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions including: \n \nRash  \n \nAnaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria \n\n \n \nUncommon \n \nRare \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \nTremor \nDysgeusia \nDizziness \n\nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nNot known \n\nEye disorders Vision blurred \nGlaucoma \nIntraocular pressure increased \n\nRare \nRare \nRare \n\nCardiac disorders Atrial fibrillation \nSupraventricular tachycardia \nRhythm idioventricular  \nTachycardia \nSupraventricular extrasystoles \nPalpitations \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nCough \nOropharyngeal pain \nDysphonia \nParadoxical bronchospasm \n\nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nRare \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Constipation \nDry mouth \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention \nDysuria \nBladder outlet obstruction \n\nRare \nRare \nRare \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAn overdose of umeclidinium/vilanterol will likely produce signs and symptoms due to the individual \ncomponents\u2019 actions, consistent with the known inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse reactions (e.g. dry \nmouth, visual accommodation disturbances and tachycardia) or those with overdose of other beta2-adrenergic \nagonists (e.g. arrhythmias, tremor, headache, palpitations, nausea, hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia). \n \nIf overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with \nanticholinergics incl. triple combinations with corticosteroids, ATC code: R03AL03 \n \nMechanism of action \nUmeclidinium/vilanterol is a combination inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist/long-acting \nbeta2-adrenergic agonist (LAMA/LABA). Following oral inhalation both compounds act locally on airways \nto produce bronchodilation by separate mechanisms. \n \nUmeclidinium \nUmeclidinium is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic). It is a \nquinuclidine derivative with activity across multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes. Umeclidinium exerts its \nbronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors \non airway smooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in \nvitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the lungs in pre-clinical models. \n \nVilanterol \nVilanterol is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta2-adrenergic agonist).  \nThe pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenergic agonists, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to \nstimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine \ntriphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels \ncause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate \nhypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn Phase III, 6-month studies umeclidinium/vilanterol provided clinically meaningful improvements over \nplacebo in lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) over 24 hours \nfollowing once daily administration, which were evident at 15 minutes following administration of the first \ndose (improvement over placebo by 112 ml (p <0.001*). Mean peak improvements in FEV1 within the first 6 \nhours following dosing relative to placebo was 224 ml (p<0.001\u2217) at Week 24. There was no evidence for \ntachyphylaxis in the effect of ANORO ELLIPTA over time. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology  \nThe effect of umeclidinium/vilanterol on the QT interval was evaluated in a placebo and active \n(moxifloxacin) controlled QT study involving once daily administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol \n113/22 micrograms or 500/100 micrograms (pre-dispensed dose with umeclidinium at eight times the \nrecommended dose and vilanterol at four times the recommended dose) for 10 days in 103 healthy \nvolunteers. The maximum mean difference in prolongations of QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia \nmethod, QTcF) from placebo after baseline-correction was 4.3 (90% CI=2.2 to 6.4) milliseconds seen 10 \nminutes after administration with umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms and 8.2 (90% CI=6.2 to 10.2) \nmilliseconds seen 30 minutes after administration with umeclidinium/vilanterol 500/100 micrograms. \nTherefore, no clinically relevant pro-arrhythmic potential related to QT-interval prolongations was observed \nwith umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms. \n \nA dose-dependent increase in heart rate was also observed. The maximum mean difference in heart rate from \nplacebo after baseline-correction was 8.4 (90% CI=7.0 to 9.8) beats/minute and 20.3 (90% CI=18.9 to 21.7) \nbeats/minute seen 10 minutes after administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms and \n500/100 micrograms respectively.  \n \nIn addition, no clinically significant effects on cardiac rhythm were observed on 24-hour Holter monitoring \nin 53 patients with COPD who were treated with umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 micrograms once daily in \n\n \n\u2217 A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison that did \nnot achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be inferred. \n\n\n\n9 \n\none 6-month study, or in a further 55 patients who received umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms once \ndaily in another 6-month study and 226 patients who received 113/22 micrograms once daily in the 12-month \nstudy. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe clinical efficacy of umeclidinium/vilanterol administered once daily was evaluated in eight Phase III \nclinical studies in 6,835 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD; 5,618 patients from five 6-month \nstudies (two placebo-controlled and three active [tiotropium]-comparator controlled), 655 patients from two \n3-month exercise endurance/lung function studies and 562 patients from a 12-month supportive study.  \n \nEffects on lung function \nANORO ELLIPTA demonstrated improvements in lung function (as defined by change from baseline in \ntrough FEV1) in several studies. In one 6-month Phase III study, ANORO ELLIPTA demonstrated \nstatistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 (primary endpoint) at Week 24 compared with placebo \nand each monotherapy component treatment arm.  In addition, ANORO ELLIPTA demonstrated clinically \nmeaningful and statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 compared with tiotropium in two of the \nthree 6-month active-comparator studies and numerically greater improvements from tiotropium in the third \nactive-comparator study (see Table 1). There was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time. \n \nSymptomatic outcomes \nBreathlessness: \nANORO ELLIPTA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in \nbreathlessness as evaluated by an increase in TDI focal score at Week 24 (key secondary end-point) \ncompared with placebo (see Table 1). Improvements in TDI focal score compared with each monotherapy \ncomponent and tiotropium were not statistically significant (see Table 1). \n \nThe proportion of patients who responded with at least the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) \nof 1 unit TDI focal score at Week 24 was greater for ANORO ELLIPTA (58%) compared with placebo \n(41%) and each monotherapy component (53% for umeclidinium and 51% for vilanterol).  \n \nHealth-related quality of life: \nANORO ELLIPTA has also shown an improvement in health-related quality of life measured using the \nSt. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in SGRQ total score at Week 24 \ncompared with placebo and each monotherapy component (see Table 1). ANORO ELLIPTA showed a \nstatistically significant reduction in SGRQ total score compared with tiotropium in one of the three active-\ncomparator studies (see Table 1). \n \nThe proportion of patients who responded with at least the MCID in SGRQ score (defined as a decrease of \n4 units from baseline) at Week 24 was greater for ANORO ELLIPTA (49%) compared with placebo (34%) \nand each monotherapy component (44% for umeclidinium and 48% for vilanterol). In one active-comparator \nstudy, a higher percentage of patients receiving ANORO ELLIPTA responded with a clinically meaningful \nimprovement in SGRQ score at Week 24 (53%) compared to tiotropium (46%). In the other two \nactive-comparator studies, a similar proportion of patients achieved at least the MCID with ANORO \nELLIPTA and tiotropium; 49% and 54% for ANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms and 52% and 55% for \ntiotropium. \n  \nUse of rescue medication \nANORO ELLIPTA reduced the use of rescue medication with salbutamol over Weeks 1-24 compared with \nplacebo and umeclidinium (see Table 1) and demonstrated an increase from baseline in the proportion of \ndays when no rescue medication was needed (on average 11.1%) compared with a decrease from baseline on \nplacebo (on average 0.9%).  \n \nIn the three 6-month active-comparator-controlled studies, ANORO ELLIPTA reduced the use of rescue \nmedication with salbutamol compared with tiotropium, with statistically significant reductions observed in \ntwo of the studies (see Table 1). ANORO ELLIPTA also demonstrated a greater increase from baseline in the \nproportion of days when no rescue medication was needed in all three studies (average within the range \n17.6% to 21.5%) compared with tiotropium (average within the range 11.7% to 13.4%). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nTable 1.

The results were similar to \nthose for the ANORO ELLIPTA dose and provided additional supportive evidence for the efficacy of \nANORO ELLIPTA.  \n \nCOPD exacerbations \nIn a 24-week placebo-controlled study in patients with symptomatic COPD, ANORO ELLIPTA reduced the \nrisk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation by 50% compared with placebo (based on analysis of time to \nfirst exacerbation: Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8; p=0.004*); by 20% compared with umeclidinium \n(HR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5, 1.3; p=0.391); and by 30% compared with vilanterol (HR 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.1; \np=0.121). From the three active-comparator studies in patients with symptomatic COPD, the risk of a \nmoderate/severe COPD exacerbation compared with tiotropium was reduced by 50% in one study (HR 0.5; \n95% CI: 0.3, 1.0; p=0.044). In the other two studies, the risk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation was \nincreased by 20% and 90% (HR 1.2; 95% CI: 0.5, 2.6; p=0.709 and HR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0, 3.6; p=0.062 \nrespectively). These studies were not specifically designed to evaluate the effect of treatments on COPD \nexacerbations and patients were withdrawn from the study if an exacerbation occurred. \n \nSupporting efficacy studies   \nIn a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study (CTT116855, IMPACT), 10,355 adult patients with \nsymptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more moderate/severe exacerbations in the prior 12 months were \nrandomised (1:2:2) to receive umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI 55/22 micrograms), fluticasone \nfuroate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 92/55/22 micrograms), or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol \n(FF/VI 92/22 micrograms) administered once daily as a single inhaler. The primary endpoint was annual rate \nof on-treatment moderate and severe exacerbations in subjects treated with FF/UMEC/VI compared with \nFF/VI and UMEC/VI. The mean annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91, 1.07 and 1.21 for FF/UMEC/VI, \nFF/VI, and UMEC/VI respectively. \n \nThe comparison of FF/UMEC/VI to FF/VI and UMEC/VI resulted in a statistically significant 14.8% \nreduction in risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation (based on analysis of time to first exacerbation) (Hazard \nRatio 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91; p<0.001) and 16.0% reduction in risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation \nrespectively (based on analysis of time to first exacerbation) (Hazard Ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.91; \np<0.001). \n \nExercise endurance and lung volumes \nANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms improved exercise endurance time compared with placebo, as \nevaluated with the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT), in one study but not the second and improved lung \nvolume measures compared with placebo in both studies in adult COPD patients with hyperinflation \n(functional residual capacity [FRC] >120%). In the first study, ANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms \ndemonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement (based on a minimal clinically \nimportant difference (MCID) between 45 to 85 seconds) over placebo in exercise endurance time (EET) \nobtained 3 hours after dosing at Week 12 (69.4 seconds [p=0.003]). Improvement in EET compared with \nplacebo was seen at Day 2 and was sustained at Week 6 and Week 12. In the second study, the treatment \ndifference in EET between ANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms and placebo was 21.9 seconds (p=0.234) at \nWeek 12. \n \nANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms also showed statistically significant improvements compared with \nplacebo in change from baseline in lung volume measures at trough and at 3 hours post dose at Week 12 in \nthe first study (inspiratory capacity: 237 ml and 316 ml respectively, residual volume: -466 ml and -643 ml \nrespectively and functional residual capacity: -351 ml and -522 ml respectively; all p<0.001). In the second \nstudy, ANORO ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms showed improvements compared with placebo in change from \nbaseline in lung volume measures at trough and at 3 hours post dose at Week 12 (inspiratory capacity: 198 ml \nand 238 ml respectively, residual volume: -295 ml and -351 ml respectively and functional residual \ncapacity: -238 ml and -302 ml respectively); all p<0.001\u2217). \n \n\n \n\u2217 A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison that did \nnot achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be inferred. \n\n\n\n12 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ANORO \nELLIPTA in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nWhen umeclidinium and vilanterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the \npharmacokinetics of each component was similar to those observed when each active substance was \nadministered separately. For pharmacokinetic purposes each component can therefore be considered \nseparately. \n \nAbsorption \n \nUmeclidinium \nFollowing inhaled administration of umeclidinium in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to 15 minutes. \nThe absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium was on average 13% of the dose, with negligible \ncontribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled umeclidinium, steady state was \nachieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 1.8-fold accumulation.  \n \nVilanterol \nFollowing inhaled administration of vilanterol in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to 15 minutes. The \nabsolute bioavailability of inhaled vilanterol was 27%, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. \nFollowing repeat dosing of inhaled vilanterol, steady state was achieved within 6 days with up to 2.4-fold \naccumulation.  \n \nDistribution \n \nUmeclidinium  \nFollowing intravenous administration to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 86 litres. \nIn vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%.   \n \nVilanterol \nFollowing intravenous administration to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution at steady state \nwas 165 litres. In vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 94%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nUmeclidinium \nIn vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and \nis a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium are \noxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range \nof metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not \nbeen established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. \n \nVilanterol \nIn vitro studies showed that vilanterol is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is a \nsubstrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for vilanterol are O-dealkylation to a range \nof metabolites with significantly reduced beta1- and beta2-adrenergic agonist activity. Plasma metabolic \nprofiles following oral administration of vilanterol in a human radiolabel study were consistent with high \nfirst-pass metabolism. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. \n \nElimination \n \nUmeclidinium  \nPlasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous \nadministration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered \n\n\n\n13 \n\nradioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the \nadministered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of the \ndrug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following \noral administration to healthy male volunteers, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of \nthe administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose. Less than \n1% of the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting \nnegligible absorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium plasma elimination half-life following \ninhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours in healthy volunteers, with 3% to 4% excreted unchanged in \nurine at steady-state. \n  \nVilanterol \nPlasma clearance of vilanterol following intravenous administration was 108 litres/hour. Following oral \nadministration of radiolabelled vilanterol, mass balance showed 70% of the radiolabel in urine and 30% in \nfaeces. Primary elimination of vilanterol was by metabolism followed by excretion of metabolites in urine \nand faeces. Vilanterol plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 11 hours. \n \nCharacteristics in specific groups of healthy volunteers or patients \n \nElderly \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium and vilanterol were \nsimilar between COPD patients 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with severe renal impairment showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to either \numeclidinium or vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) following administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol with \numeclidinium at twice the recommended dose and vilanterol at the recommended dose and no evidence of \naltered protein binding between patients with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) showed no evidence of an increase in \nsystemic exposure to either umeclidinium or vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) following administration of \numeclidinium/vilanterol with umeclidinium at twice the recommended dose and vilanterol at the \nrecommended dose and no evidence of altered protein binding between patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment and healthy volunteers. Umeclidinium/vilanterol has not been evaluated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \nOther special populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that no dose adjustment is required for umeclidinium or \nvilanterol based on the effect of age, race, gender, inhaled corticosteroid use, or weight. A study in CYP2D6 \npoor metabolisers showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism on \nsystemic exposure to umeclidinium.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nIn nonclinical studies with umeclidinium and vilanterol, alone and in combination, findings were those \ntypically associated with the primary pharmacology of either muscarinic receptor antagonists or \nbeta2-adrenergic agonists respectively and/or local irritancy. The following statements reflect studies \nconducted on the individual components. \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \nUmeclidinium was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime \ninhalation studies in mice or rats at exposures \u2265 26 or \u2265 22-fold, times the human clinical exposure of \numeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC, respectively. \n \nIn genetic toxicity studies, vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic \nindicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans. Consistent with \nfindings for other beta2-adrenergic agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies, vilanterol trifenatate caused \n\n\n\n14 \n\nproliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and in the rat pituitary gland. There was \nno increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 0.5- or 13-fold, times the human clinical \nexposure of vilanterol 22 micrograms based on AUC, respectively. \n \nToxicity to reproduction \nUmeclidinium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous \nadministration of umeclidinium to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption \nand slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 180 micrograms/kg/day dose \n(approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC). \n \nVilanterol was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol caused effects similar to \nthose seen with other beta2-adrenergic agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb \nflexure/malrotation) at 6-times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. When given subcutaneously \nthere were no effects at 36-times the human clinical exposure of vilanterol 22 micrograms, based on AUC. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n Step-by-step instructions  \n \n \n1. What ANORO ELLIPTA is and what it is used for \n \nWhat ANORO ELLIPTA is  \n \nANORO ELLIPTA contains two active substances umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol. These belong to a \ngroup of medicines called bronchodilators. \n \nWhat ANORO ELLIPTA is used for  \n \nANORO ELLIPTA is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a \nlong-term condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.  \n \nIn COPD the muscles around the airways tighten. This medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles in the \nlungs, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. When used regularly, it can help to control your \nbreathing difficulties and reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.  \n \n\nANORO ELLIPTA should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing.  \nIf you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). If you \ndo not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. \n\n \n \n2.

If \nyou are not sure what your medicine contains talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSome medicines may affect how this medicine works, or make it more likely that you\u2019ll have side effects. \nThese include: \n- medicines called beta blockers (such as propranolol), to treat high blood pressure or other heart \n\nproblems \n- ketoconazole or itraconazole, to treat fungal infections \n- clarithromycin or telithromycin, to treat bacterial infections  \n- ritonavir, to treat HIV infection \n- medicines that lower the amount of potassium in your blood, such as some diuretics (water tablets) or \n\nsome medicines used to treat asthma (such as methylxanthine or steroids)   \n- other long-acting medicines similar to this medicine that are used to treat breathing problems, e.g. \n\ntiotropium, indacaterol.
