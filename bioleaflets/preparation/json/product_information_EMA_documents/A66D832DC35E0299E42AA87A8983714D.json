NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (corresponding to \n\n300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil maleate). \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\nEach tablet contains 155 mg lactose monohydrate.  \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nLight blue, round, biconvex, film-coated tablets, 12.20 ± 0.20 mm in diameter, debossed with \n\n‘TN245’ on one side and ‘M’ on other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nHIV-1 infection \n\nTenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other \n\nantiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. \n\n \nIn adults, the demonstration of the benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infection is based on \n\nresults of one study in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load \n\n(> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies in which tenofovir disoproxil was added to stable background \n\ntherapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral pre-treated patients experiencing early virological \n\nfailure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of patients having < 5,000 copies/ml). \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 \n\ninfected adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, aged \n\n12 to < 18 years. \n\n \nThe choice of tenofovir disoproxil to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection \n\nshould be based on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. \n\n \nHepatitis B infection \n\nTenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B \n\nin adults with: \n\n \n• compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or \n\nfibrosis (see section 5.1). \n\n \n• evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n• decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B \n\nin adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age with: \n\n \n• compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication, \n\npersistently elevated serum ALT levels and histological evidence of active inflammation \n\nand/or fibrosis (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or \n\ntreatment of chronic hepatitis B. \n\n \nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose of tenofovir disoproxil for the treatment of HIV or for the treatment of \n\nchronic hepatitis B is 245 mg (one tablet) once daily taken orally with food. \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B \n\nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown. Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n- In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least 6-\n\n12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe \n\ndetection) is confirmed or until HBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section \n\n4.4). Serum ALT and HBV DNA levels should be followed regularly after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation to detect any late virological relapse. \n\n \n- In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With prolonged treatment for \n\nmore than 2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the \n\nselected therapy remains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nFor treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in adults for whom a solid dosage form is not \n\nappropriate, other suitable formulations may be checked for their availability. \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan is available only as 245 mg film-coated tablets. Other suitable \n\nformulations may be checked for their availability. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nHIV-1: In adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg, the recommended dose of \n\ntenofovir disoproxil is 245 mg (one tablet) once daily taken orally with food (see sections 4.8 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\nReduced doses of tenofovir disoproxil are used for treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients \n\naged 2 to < 12 years. As Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is available only as 245 mg film-coated tablets, it \n\nis not suitable for the use in paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years. Other suitable formulations may \n\nbe checked for their availability. \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children under 2 years of age have \n\nnot been established. No data are available. \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B: In adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg, the recommended \n\ndose of tenofovir disoproxil is 245 mg (one tablet) once daily, taken orally with food (see sections \n\n4.8 and 5.1). The optimal duration of treatment is currently unknown. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in children with chronic hepatitis B aged 2 to < \n\n12 years or weighing < 35 kg have not been established. No data are available. \n\n \nFor treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years for \n\nwhom a solid dosage form is not appropriate, other suitable formulations may be checked for their \n\navailability. \n\n \nMissed dose \n\nIf a patient misses a dose of tenofovir disoproxil within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the \n\npatient should take tenofovir disoproxil with food as soon as possible and resume their normal \n\ndosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose of tenofovir disoproxil by more than 12 hours and it is \n\nalmost time for their next dose, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the \n\nusual dosing schedule. \n\n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking tenofovir disoproxil, another tablet should be taken. \n\nIf the patient vomits more than 1 hour after taking tenofovir disoproxil they do not need to take \n\nanother dose. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nTenofovir is eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to tenofovir increases in patients with \n\nrenal dysfunction. \n \n\nAdults \n\nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with \n\nmoderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and long-term safety data \n\nhas not been evaluated for mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min). Therefore, in \n\nadult patients with renal impairment tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential \n\nbenefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Administration of tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 33 mg/g granules to provide a reduced daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil is recommended \n\nfor adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients.  \n\n \nMild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) \n\nLimited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil in \n\npatients with mild renal impairment. \n\n \nModerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) \n\nSince administration of a lower dose with the 245 mg tablet is not possible, prolonged dose intervals \n\nusing the 245 mg film-coated tablets may be used. Administration of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil \n\nevery 48 hours can be used based on modelling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in HIV negative \n\nand non-HBV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal \n\ndisease requiring haemodialysis, but has not been confirmed in clinical studies. Therefore, clinical \n\nresponse to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients (see sections \n\n4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and haemodialysis patients \n\nAdequate dose adjustments cannot be applied due to lack of alternative tablet strengths, therefore use \n\nin this group of patients is not recommended. If no alternative treatment is available, prolonged dose \n\nintervals may be used as follows: \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nSevere renal impairment: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil may be administered every 72-96 hours (dosing \n\ntwice a week). \n\n \nHaemodialysis patients: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil may be administered every 7 days following \n\ncompletion of a haemodialysis session.* \n\n \n\nThese dose interval adjustments have not been confirmed in clinical studies. Simulations suggest that \n\nthe prolonged dose interval using tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets is not optimal and \n\ncould result in increased toxicity and possibly inadequate response. Therefore, clinical response to \n\ntreatment and renal function should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n*Generally, once weekly dosing assuming three haemodialysis sessions per week, each of \n\napproximately 4 hours duration or after 12 hours cumulative haemodialysis. \n\n \nNo dosing recommendations can be given for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance \n\n< 10 ml/min. \n\n \nPaediatrics \n\nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \nIf tenofovir disoproxil is discontinued in patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without HIV co-\n\ninfection, these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets should be taken once daily, orally with food. \n\n \n\nHowever, in exceptional circumstances Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg film-coated tablets can \n\nbe administered following disintegration of the tablet in at least 100 ml of water, orange juice or grape \n\njuice. \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). \n\n \nHIV-1 \n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \n\nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent \n\ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B \n\nPatients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of \n\ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood. Appropriate \n\nprecautions must continue to be used. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n\n- Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be administered concomitantly with other \n\nmedicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n\n- Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n\n- Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \nTriple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \n\nstage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as \n\nwith lamivudine and didanosine as a once-daily regimen. \n \n\nRenal and bone effects in adult population \n\n \n\nRenal effects \n\nTenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney. Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated \n\ncreatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been \n\nreported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n\n \nRenal monitoring \n\nIt is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with \n\ntenofovir disoproxil and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored \n\nafter two to four weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months \n\nthereafter in patients without renal risk factors. In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more \n\nfrequent monitoring of renal function is required. \n\n \nRenal management \n\nIf serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in \n\nany adult patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, \n\nincluding measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see \n\nsection 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration should also be given to interrupting treatment with \n\ntenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with creatinine clearance decreased to < 50 ml/min or decreases in \n\nserum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl (0.32 mmol/l). Interrupting treatment with tenofovir disoproxil should \n\nalso be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been \n\nidentified. \n\n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \n\nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \n\nmedicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, \n\nvancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2). If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic \n\nagents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. \n\n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \n\ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \n\nfor renal dysfunction. If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should \n\nbe monitored adequately. \n\n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in \n\ncombination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of renal \n\nfunction is required in these patients (see section 4.5). In patients with renal risk factors, the co-\n\nadministration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully \n\nevaluated. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products \n\nwhich are secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nanion transporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal \n\nproduct). These renal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal \n\nelimination of tenofovir and cidofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal \n\nproducts, which are secreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 \n\nor MRP 4, might be modified if they are co-administered. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant \n\nuse of these medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, \n\nbut if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nRenal safety with tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients \n\nwith impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). \n\n \nAdult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients: \n\nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with impaired \n\nrenal function. Therefore, tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits of \n\ntreatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks. In patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and in patients who require haemodialysis use of tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil is not recommended. If no alternative treatment is available, the dosing interval must be \n\nadjusted and renal function should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \nBone effects \n\nIn HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil \n\nwith stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, \n\nsmall decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment \n\ngroups. Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly \n\ngreater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in BMD of hip were \n\nsignificantly greater in this group until 96 weeks. However, there was no increased risk of fractures \n\nor evidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n\n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were \n\nseen in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \n\ninhibitor. Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that \n\nare at a high risk for fractures. \n\n \n\nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \n\ntubulopathy (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIf bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained.  \n\n \n\nRenal and bone effects in paediatric population \n\n \n\nThere are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. Moreover, the \n\nreversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is \n\nrecommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide \n\nthe appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and \n\nconsider the need for supplementation. \n\n \nRenal effects \n\nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV-1 \n\ninfected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see sections 4.8 \n\nand 5.1). \n\n \nRenal monitoring \n\nRenal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to treatment, and \n\nmonitored during treatment as in adults (see above). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nRenal management \n\nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving \n\ntenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including \n\nmeasurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, \n\nproximal tubulopathy). If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a \n\nnephrologist should be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment. \n\nInterrupting treatment with tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive \n\ndecline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. \n\n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \n\nThe same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment \n\n(see section 4.2). Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal \n\nimpairment and should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment \n\nduring tenofovir disoproxil therapy. \n\n \nBone effects \n\nTenofovir disoproxil may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil -\n\nassociated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently \n\nunknown (see section 5.1). \n\n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \n\nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n\n \nLiver disease \n\n \n\nSafety and efficacy data are very limited in liver transplant patients. \n\n \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HBV infected patients \n\nwith decompensated liver disease and who have a Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score > 9. These \n\npatients may be at higher risk of experiencing serious hepatic or renal adverse reactions. Therefore, \n\nhepatobiliary and renal parameters should be closely monitored in this patient population. \n\n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \n\nFlares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are \n\ncharacterised by transient increases in serum ALT. After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may \n\nincrease in some patients (see section 4.8). In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \n\nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \n\nhepatic decompensation. Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \n\nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n\n \nFlares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in \n\npatients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy. Post-treatment exacerbations are usually \n\nassociated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited. However, severe \n\nexacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at \n\nrepeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after \n\ndiscontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be \n\nwarranted. In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not \n\nrecommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n\n \nLiver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients co-\n\ninfected with hepatitis C or D virus. \n\n \nCo-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in \n\nHIV/HBV co-infected patients. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \n\nhepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is \n\nevidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must \n\nbe considered. However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance \n\nduring therapy with tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. \n\n \n\nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \n\n \n\nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \n\nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \n\nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \n\nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with \n\nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \n\nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV \n\nprotease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at \n\nincreased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \n\nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV \n\nprotease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n\n \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \n\n \n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \n\ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \n\nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \n\nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \n\nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n\n \n\nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \n\npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial \n\ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; \n\nthese have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main \n\nadverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic \n\ndisorders (hyperlactataemia, hyperlipasaemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset \n\nneurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). \n\nWhether such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These \n\nfindings should be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present \n\nwith severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings \n\ndo not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to \n\nprevent vertical transmission of HIV. \n\n \n\nImmune reactivation syndrome \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \n\ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \n\nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed \n\nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. \n\nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n\n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported \n\nto occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable \n\nand these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\n \n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \n\nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \n\nreported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \n\nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n\n \nElderly \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. Elderly patients are more \n\nlikely to have decreased renal function; therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \n\npatients with tenofovir disoproxil. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate. Consequently, \n\npatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-\n\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the \n\npotential for CYP450-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is \n\nlow. \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products \n\ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n\n \nDidanosine \n\nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \n\nTable 1). \n\n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \n\nSince tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with \n\nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport \n\nproteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir \n\nand/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n\n \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \n\nmedicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, \n\nfoscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGiven that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is co-\n\nadministered with tenofovir disoproxil. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \nOther interactions \n\n \n\nInteractions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below \n\n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once \n\ndaily as “q.d.”). \n\n \nTable 1: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products \n\nMedicinal product by \n\ntherapeutic areas (dose in \n\nmg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \n\nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, \n\nCmin \n\nRecommendation \n\nconcerning \n\nco-administration with \n\n245 mg tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil  \nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nProtease inhibitors \n\nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n\n(300 q.d./100 q.d.) \n\nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↓ 25%  \nCmax: ↓ 28%  \nCmin: ↓ 26%  \nTenofovir:  \nAUC: ↑ 37%  \nCmax: ↑ 34%  \nCmin: ↑ 29% \n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrecommended.

Animal studies do \n\nnot indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be \n\nconsidered during pregnancy, if necessary. \n\n \n\nIn the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been \n\nshown to reduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given \n\nto mothers, in addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were \n\nadministered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 \n\nmonths postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery. No \n\nsafety signal has emerged from these data. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nTenofovir has been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the \n\neffects of tenofovir in newborns/infants. Therefore Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be used \n\nduring breast-feeding. \n\n \nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV and HBV infected women do not breast-feed \n\ntheir infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV and HBV to the infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. Animal \n\nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\npatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, \n\nrenal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nsometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported. \n\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \nHIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \n\nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents. These \n\nreactions are usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events. Approximately 1% of tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil -treated adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. \n\n \nHepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \n\nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild. In clinical trials of HBV \n\ninfected patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was nausea \n\n(5.4%). \n\n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who \n\nhave discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety data from clinical \n\nstudies and post-marketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. \n\n \nHIV-1 clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on \n\nexperience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced patients receiving treatment with tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nfor 24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 treatment-naïve \n\npatients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or stavudine (n = 301) in \n\ncombination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. \n\n \nHepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is \n\nprimarily based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult \n\npatients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks. The \n\nadverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety \n\nprofile of tenofovir disoproxil. After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using \n\nCockcroft-Gault equation) or -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease \n\n[MDRD] equation) after the first 4 weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of \n\nrenal function reported in tenofovir disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using \n\nCockcroft-Gault equation) and -0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation).  \n\n \n\nPatients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients \n\nwith decompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study (GS-\n\nUS-174-0108) in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or \n\nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. \n\n \nIn the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \n\nevent; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \n\nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant \n\ndifferences between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm. After \n\n168 weeks, 16% (7/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus \n\ntenofovir disoproxil group, and 14% (3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure. \n\nThirteen percent (6/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus \n\ntenofovir disoproxil group, and 9% (2/22) of the entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum \n\ncreatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n\n \nAt week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of \n\n13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \n\ngroup and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in \n\nthe tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% \n\n(2/22) in the entecavir group. \n\n \nSubjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \nPatients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which \n\n280 lamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or \n\nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. \n\n \nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below \n\nby body system organ class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \n\nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common \n\n(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000). \n\n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil based \n\non clinical study and post-marketing experience \n\nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \n\nVery common: hypophosphataemia\n1\n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nUncommon: hypokalaemia\n1\n \n\nRare: lactic acidosis \n\nNervous system disorders: \n\nVery common: dizziness \n\nCommon: headache \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n\nCommon: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence \n\nUncommon: pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: \n\nCommon: increased transaminases \n\nRare: hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \n\nVery common: rash \n\nRare: angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \n\nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis\n1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n1, \n\n2, myopathy1 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: \n\nUncommon: increased creatinine, proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nRare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, nephritis (including acute \n\ninterstitial nephritis)2, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \n\nVery common: asthenia \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\n \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is not considered to be \n\ncausally associated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled \n\nclinical trials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program. The frequency category was estimated from a \n\nstatistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled \n\nclinical trials and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: \n\nRenal impairment \n\nAs tenofovir disoproxil may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety profile). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved \n\nor improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. However, in some patients, declines in \n\ncreatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. \n\nPatients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV \n\ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of \n\nexperiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nLactic acidosis \n\nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with other \n\nantiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver disease, or \n\npatients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased risk of \n\nexperiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal outcomes. \n\n \n\nHIV-1: \n\nMetabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune reactivation syndrome \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \n\ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune \n\ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \n\nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \n\ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \nOsteonecrosis \n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged \n\nrisk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is \n\nunknown (see section 4.4). \n\n \nHepatitis B: \n\nExacerbations of hepatitis during treatment \n\nIn studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit \n\nof normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients. ALT \n\nelevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a \n\nmajority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or \n\ncoincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during \n\ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \n\nIn HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have \n\noccurred after discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nHIV-1 \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and \n\nGS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received \n\ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination \n\nwith other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1). The adverse reactions observed in \n\npaediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those \n\nobserved in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary \n\nof adverse reactions and 5.1). \n\n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the \n\nBMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \n\nobserved in subjects who received placebo. In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed \n\nin subjects who switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who \n\nremained on their stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n\n(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse \n\nevents.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\ntubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy. Seven patients had estimated \n\nglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Among them, 3 patients \n\nexperienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation \n\nof tenofovir disoproxil. \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomised study (study GS-US-174-0115) in \n\n106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with \n\ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks. The adverse reactions \n\nobserved in adolescent patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent \n\nwith those observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated \n\nsummary of adverse reactions and 5.1). \n\n \nReductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected adolescents. The BMD Z-scores observed \n\nin subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who \n\nreceived placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nOther special population(s) \n\nElderly \n\nTenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. Elderly patients are more \n\nlikely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \n\npatients with tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). \n\n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\nSince tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is \n\nrecommended in adult patients with renal impairment treated with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan \n\n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). The use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric \n\npatients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and \n\n5.3), and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nTenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is \n\n134 ml/min. It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide \n\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07. \n\n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil maleate is the maleate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside \n\nmonophosphate (nucleotide) analogue. Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir \n\ndiphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes. Tenofovir \n\ndiphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral \n\nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and \n\nthe HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate \n\nand, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak \n\ninhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ. At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also \n\nshown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro \n\nassays. \n\n \n\nData pertaining to HIV \n\nHIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of \n\nthe wild-type laboratory strain HIV-1\nIIIB \n\nis 1-6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against \n\nprimary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs. Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, \n\nD, E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells. Tenofovir shows \n\nactivity in vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. \n\n \nResistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in \n\nreverse transcriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and \n\nsafety). Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with strains \n\nharbouring the K65R mutation (see section 4.4). In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse \n\ntranscriptase has been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to \n\ntenofovir. \n\n \nClinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors. The results \n\nindicate that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations \n\n(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced \n\nresponse to tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 \n\ninfected adults have been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \nIn study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean \n\nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of < 5,000 \n\ncopies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years. Baseline genotypic analysis \n\nof HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance mutations \n\nassociated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated with \n\nprotease inhibitors and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors. \n\n \nAt week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \n\n(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001). A statistically significant difference in favour of \n\ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week \n\n24 (DAVG24) for CD4 count (+13 cells/mm\n3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 \n\nfor placebo, p-value = 0.0008). The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through \n\n48 weeks (DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 \n\nor 50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively). Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated \n\npatients developed the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \nThe 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and \n\nsafety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine \n\nand efavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy. The mean baseline CD4 \n\ncell count was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% \n\nof patients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS. Patients were stratified by baseline \n\nHIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads > \n\n100,000 copies/ml and 39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. \n\n \nBy intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as \n\nfailure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at \n\n48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, \n\ncompared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm. At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with \n\nHIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the \n\ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. \n\n \nThe average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was \n\nsimilar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm\n3 in the \n\ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively). At 144 weeks of treatment, the \n\naverage change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and -3.03 log10 \ncopies/ml; +263 and +283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, \n\nrespectively). A consistent response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen \n\nregardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. \n\n \nThe K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \n\ngroup than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%). Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either \n\npreceded or was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases. Eight patients had HIV that \n\nexpressed K65R in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks \n\nof treatment and the last one at week 96. No further K65R development was observed up to week \n\n144. One patient in the tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus. From \n\nboth the genotypic and phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of resistance to \n\ntenofovir. \n\n \nData pertaining to HBV \n\nHBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed \n\nin the HepG2 2.2.15 cell line. The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, \n\nwith CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. \n\n \nResistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified \n\n(see Clinical efficacy and safety). In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, \n\nrtL180M, and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine \n\nshowed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus. HBV \n\nstrains expressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated \n\nwith resistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of \n\nwild-type virus. HBV strains expressing the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and \n\nrtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus. \n\nViruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-\n\nfold that of wild-type virus. \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is \n\nbased on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and \n\nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B. Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, \n\nlamivudine-experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline. Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological \n\nresponses in compensated patients. \n\n \nExperience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-\n\nUS-174-0103) \n\nResults through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in \n\nTable 3 below. Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) HBeAg \n\npositive patients while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) \n\npatients negative for HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. \n\n \nIn both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the \n\nprimary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and \n\nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \n\nfibrosis). Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater \n\nproportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg \n\ntreatment. Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as \n\nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \n\nfibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 3 below). \n\n \nIn study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \n\ngroup than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week \n\n48 (see Table 3 below). \n\n \nTable 3: Efficacy parameters in compensated HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \n\nat week 48 \n\n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \n\nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\n \n\nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n\n10 mg n = 125 \n\nTenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\n \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n\n10 mg  \n\n \n\nn = 90 \n\nComplete response \n\n(%)a \n\n71* 49 67* 12 \n\nHistology \n\n \n\nHistological response \n\n(%)b \n\n \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\nMedian HBV DNA \n\nreduction from \n\nbaselinec \n\n \n\n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n-4.7* -4.0 -6.4* -3.7 \n\nHBV DNA (%) \n\n \n\n< 400 copies/ml \n\n(< 69 IU/ml) \n\n \n\n \n\n93* \n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n76* \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\nALT (%) \n\n \n\nNormalised ALTd \n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\n68* \n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\nSerology (%) \n\n \n\nHBeAg \n\nloss/seroconversio\n\nn \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nn/a \n\n \n\n \n\n0/0 \n\n \n\n \n\nn/a \n\n \n\n \n\n0/0 \n\n \n\n \n\n22/21 \n\n \n\n \n\n3*/1 \n\n \n\n \n\n18/18 \n\n \n\n \n\n0/0 \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nHBsAg \n\nloss/seroconversio\n\nn \n* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05. \na Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement \n\nof at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nb Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nc Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the \n\nlimit of detection (LOD) of the assay. \nd The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at \n\nbaseline. \n\nn/a = not applicable. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with \n\nundetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche \n\nCobas Taqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, \n\n56% and study GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. \n\n \n\nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) \n\nand nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT \n\n(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was associated \n\nwith a mean change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week \n\ndata, of -5.74 log10 copies/ml (n = 18). In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. \n\n \nExperience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg plus 200 mg \n\nemtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in \n\nHBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ \n\n1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks. At baseline, \n\n57% of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to \n\nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with \n\nlamivudine. Overall at week 24, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of \n\npatients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with \n\nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.672). In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated \n\nwith tenofovir disoproxil had undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of \n\nquantification of the Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated \n\nwith emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504). Comparisons between treatment groups \n\nbeyond week 24 are difficult to interpret since investigators had the option to intensify treatment to \n\nopen-label emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil. Long-term studies to evaluate the benefit/risk of \n\nbitherapy with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV monoinfected patients are ongoing. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) \n\nStudy GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety \n\nand efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and \n\nentecavir (n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease. In the tenofovir disoproxil \n\ntreatment arm, patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and \n\nmean serum ALT of 61 U/l at baseline. Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months \n\nof prior lamivudine experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and \n\n9 of 45 patients (20%) had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline. \n\nThe co-primary safety endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed \n\nincrease in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n\n \n\nIn patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of \n\nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after \n\n48 weeks of treatment. \n\n \nOverall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the \n\ncomparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 7 \n\nbelow). \n\n \nTable 7: Safety and efficacy parameters in decompensated patients at week 48 \n \n\n Study 174-0108 \nParameter Tenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n\n(n = 45) \n\nEmtricitabine 200 mg/ \n\ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg (n = 45) \n\nEntecavir \n\n(0.5 mg or 1 mg) \n\nn = 22 \n\nTolerability failure \n\n(permanent \n\ndiscontinuation of study \n\ndrug due to a treatment \n\nemergent AE) \n\nn (%)a \n\n3 (7%) 2 (4%) 2 (9%) \n\nConfirmed increase in \n\nserum creatinine ≥ \n\n0.5 mg/dl from baseline \n\nor confirmed serum \n\nphosphate of < 2 mg/dl \n\nn (%)b \n\n4 (9%) 3 (7%) 1 (5%) \n\nHBV DNA n (%) \n\n< 400 copies/ml \n \n\nn (%) \n\n31/44 (70%) 36/41 (88%) 16/22 (73%) \n\nALT n (%) \n \n\nNormal ALT \n\n25/44 (57%) 31/41 (76%) 12/22 (55%) \n\n≥ 2 point decrease in \n\nCPT from baseline \n \n\nn (%) \n\n7/27 (26%) 12/25 (48%) 5/12 (42%) \n\nMean change from \n\nbaseline in CPT score \n\n-0.8 -0.9 -1.3 \n\nMean change from \n\nbaseline in MELD score \n\n-1.8 -2.3 -2.6 \n\na p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 0.622, \nb p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 1.000. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nExperience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 \n\nUsing a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil, 76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% \n\n(11/21) of subjects receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. \n\n \n\nExperience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind \n\nstudy (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with \n\ncompensated liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of \n\nlamivudine resistance (rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M). Only five had adefovir-associated resistance \n\nmutations at baseline. One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively. Baseline \n\ndemographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were \n\nHBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and \n\nmean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. \n\n \nAfter 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had \n\nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation. After 240 weeks \n\nof treatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had HBV DNA \n\n< 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation. Among the HBeAg positive \n\nsubjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced HBeAg loss, and \n\n8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240. In the HBeAg \n\npositive subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 13 of 68 subjects (19%) \n\nexperienced HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through \n\nweek 240. Two subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss by Week 240, \n\nbut not seroconversion to anti-HBs. Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil experienced HBsAg loss with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion to anti-\n\nHBs. \n\n \nClinical resistance \n\nFour hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 250) and HBeAg positive \n\n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients initially randomised to double-blind tenofovir disoproxil \n\ntreatment and then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for \n\ngenotypic changes in HBV polymerase from baseline. Genotypic evaluations performed on all \n\npatients with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 39), 96 (n = 24), 144 (n = 6), 192 (n = \n\n5), 240 (n = 4), 288 (n = 6) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no \n\nmutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n\n \nTwo hundred and fifteen HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 125) and HBeAg positive (GS-US-\n\n174-0103, n = 90) patients initially randomised to double-blind adefovir dipivoxil treatment and then \n\nswitched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic changes in HBV \n\npolymerase from baseline. Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with HBV DNA > \n\n400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 16), 96 (n = 5), 144 (n = 1), 192 (n = 2), 240 (n = 1), 288 (n = 1) and \n\n384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil resistance have developed. \n\n \nIn study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \n\ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil for up to 168 weeks. \n\nGenotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients \n\nwith HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance \n\nto tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 \n\nsubjects in the tenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48. No amino acid substitutions associated with \n\ntenofovir disoproxil resistance were detected in any subject. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nIn study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline \n\nreceived tenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks. Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who \n\nexperienced a viremic episode (HBV DNA>400 copies/ml) at their last timepoint on tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil. Among them, sequence data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were \n\navailable for 2 of 4 patients. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n\n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine \n\nresistance mutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks \n\nand then 51/52 patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil group). Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with \n\nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6) week 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), \n\nand week 192 (n = 3). Fifty-four patients (including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance \n\nmutations at baseline) initially received blinded placebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients \n\nfollowed with tenofovir disoproxil (PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group). Genotypic evaluations were \n\nperformed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), \n\nweek 144 (n = 7), and week 192(n = 8). No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \n\ntenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nHIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years \n\nof age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an \n\noptimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of \n\ntenofovir disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week \n\n24. However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult data \n\nand comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n\n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-\n\nscore was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, \n\nat baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar \n\nspine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil \n\nand placebo groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil \n\ngroup compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir disoproxil group \n\nand one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% \n\nloss). Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, BMD Z-scores \n\ndeclined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n\n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \n\nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to \n\neither replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their \n\noriginal regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks. At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \n\ntreatment group and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 \n\nRNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml. The difference in the proportion of patients who \n\nmaintained < 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of \n\ndiscontinuations in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group. When missing data were excluded, \n\n91% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine \n\nor zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. \n\n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received treatment \n\nwith tenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 \n\nand -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline. Mean \n\nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \n\nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \n\nzidovudine groups, respectively. The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \n\nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \n\nor zidovudine treatment group. One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \n\nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48. BMD \n\nZ-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \n\nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \n\nweight. \n\n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n\ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \n\nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \n\ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \n\naged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT \n(≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks. Subjects must have been \nnaïve to tenofovir disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior \nto screening) or any other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide \ntherapy (> 16 weeks prior to screening). At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < \n400 copies/ml. Seventy-four percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had \nnormalised ALT at week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group. Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine- resistant patients (n = 6). Ninety-five percent \nof nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide- experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-\nresistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 72. Thirty-one of the 32 \nnucleos(t)ide-experienced patients had prior lamivudine experience. At week 72, 96% (27/28) of \n\nimmune-active patients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x ULN) in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < \n400 copies/ml. Seventy-five percent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup had normal ALT at week 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. \n \nAfter 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment up to week 192. After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those \nreceiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir \ndisoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-\ntenofovir disoproxil group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 192. Among the subjects who \nreceived placebo during the double-blind period, the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/mL rose sharply after they began treatment with open-label tenofovir disoproxil \n(PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group \nhad HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 192. The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at \nweek 192 in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who \nwere HBeAg positive at baseline and 100.0% (2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg \nnegative at baseline. Similar percentages of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil \nand PLB-tenofovir disoproxil groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion to \nanti-HBe through week 192. \n \n\nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0115 are summarized in Table 8: \n\n \nTable 8: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline, Week 72 and 192 \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nBaseline Week 72 Week 192 \n\nTenofovir \n\ndisoproxil-\n\ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\n\ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \n\ndisoproxil-\n\ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\n\ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \n\ndisoproxil-\n\ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\n\ntenofovir \n\ndisoproxil \n\nLumbar spine mean \n\n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.42  \n\n(0.762) \n\n-0.26  \n\n(0.806) \n\n-0.49  \n\n(0.852)  \n\n-0.23 \n\n(0.893)  \n\n-0.37 \n\n(0.946)  \n\n-0.44 \n\n(0.920)  \n\nLumbar spine mean \n\n(SD) change from \n\nbaseline \n\nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA \n-0.06  \n\n(0.320) \n\n0.10  \n\n(0.378) \n\n0.02  \n\n(0.548) \n\n-0.10 \n\n(0.543) \n\nWhole body mean \n\n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.19  \n\n(1.110) \n\n−0.23 \n\n(0.859) \n\n−0.36 \n\n (1.077) \n\n−0.12 \n\n(0.916) \n\n−0.38 \n\n(0.934) \n\n−0.42 \n\n (0.942) \n\nWhole body mean \n\n(SD) change from \n\nbaseline \n\nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA \n−0.16 \n\n(0.355) \n\n0.09 \n\n(0.349) \n\n-0.16 \n\n(0.521) \n\n-0.19  \n\n(0.504) \n\nLumbar spine BMD \n\nat least 6% decreaseb \nNA NA \n\n1.9% \n\n(1 subject) \n0% \n\n3.8% \n\n(2 subjects) \n\n3.7% \n\n(2 subjects) \n\nWhole body BMD at \n\nleast 6% decreaseb \nNA NA 0% 0% 0% \n\n1.9% \n\n(1 subject) \n\nLumbar spine BMD \n\nmean % increase \nNA NA 5.14% 8.08% 10.05% 11.21% \n\nWhole body BMD \n\nmean % increase \nNA NA 3.07% 5.39% 6.09% 7.22% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores not adjusted for height and weight \nb Primary safety endpoint through week 72 \n\n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ntenofovir disoproxil in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HIV and chronic \n\nhepatitis B (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil is a water soluble ester prodrug which is rapidly converted in vivo to tenofovir \n\nand formaldehyde. \n\n \nTenofovir is converted intracellularly to tenofovir monophosphate and to the active component, \n\ntenofovir diphosphate. \n\n \nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV infected patients, tenofovir disoproxil is \n\nrapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir. Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil \n\nwith a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values \n\nof 326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively. Maximum \n\ntenofovir concentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and \n\nwithin two hours when taken with food. The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil in fasted patients was approximately 25%. Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a \n\nhigh fat meal enhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately \n\n40% and Cmax by approximately 14%. Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, \n\nthe median Cmax in serum ranged from 213 to 375 ng/ml. However, administration of tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil with a light meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was \n\nestimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg. After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir \n\nis distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the \n\nintestinal contents (preclinical studies). In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum \n\nprotein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to \n\n25 µg/ml. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \n\nCYP450 enzymes. Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \n\nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the \n\nmajor human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2). Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any \n\nof the CYP450 isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction \n\nin metabolism of CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed. Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically \n\nsignificant interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by \n\nCYP450 would occur. \n\n \nElimination \n\nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport \n\nsystem with approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \n\nadministration. Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately \n\n300 ml/min). Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately \n\n210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular \n\nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir. Following oral administration the \n\nterminal half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n\n \nStudies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into \n\nproximal tubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into \n\nthe urine by the multidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). \n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose \n\nrange 75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. \n\n \nAge \n\nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in the elderly (over 65 years of age). \n \n\nGender \n\nLimited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. \n\n \nEthnicity \n\nPharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nHIV-1: Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent \n\npatients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg. Mean (± SD) Cmax and AUCtau are \n\n0.38 ± 0.13 μg/ml and 3.39 ± 1.22 μg·h/ml, respectively. Tenofovir exposure achieved in \n\nadolescent patients receiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to \n\nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n\n \n\nChronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients (12 to \n\n< 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to \n\nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg tablets in \n\nchildren under 12 years or with renal impairment. \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose \n\nof tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees \n\nof renal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function \n\nwhen CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 ml/min and \n\nsevere with CrCl = 10-29 ml/min). Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean \n\n(%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/min to \n\nrespectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ml in patients with \n\nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment. The dosing recommendations in patients with renal \n\nimpairment, with increased dosing interval, are expected to result in higher peak plasma \n\nconcentrations and lower Cmin levels in patients with renal impairment compared with patients with \n\nnormal renal function. The clinical implications of this are unknown. \n\n \nIn patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 10 ml/min) requiring haemodialysis, between \n\ndialysis tenofovir concentrations substantially increased over 48 hours achieving a mean Cmax of \n\n1,032 ng/ml and a mean AUC0-48h of 42,857 ng·h/ml. \n\n \nIt is recommended that the dosing interval for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg is modified in adult \n\npatients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or in patients who already have ESRD and require \n\ndialysis (see section 4.2). \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance \n\n< 10 ml/min and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not \n\nbeen studied. \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied. \n\nNo data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult \n\npatients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) \n\nclassification. Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic \n\nimpairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects. The mean (%CV) \n\ntenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, \n\nin normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \n\nsevere hepatic impairment. \n\n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \n\nIn non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir \n\ndiphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin- \n\nstimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans. Findings in repeated \n\ndose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical \n\nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a \n\ndecrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) \n\nand reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats and \n\ndogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\noccurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-\n\nfold the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a \n\nsubstance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction \n\nin BMD. \n\n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \n\nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \n\nhepatocytes. However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n\n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \n\nextremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n\n \nReproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \n\nparameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-\n\npostnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n\n \nThe active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\nIf this medicine has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this \n\nleaflet is addressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil. This active substance \n\nis an antiretroviral or antiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both. \n\nTenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by \n\ninterfering with the normal working of enzymes (in HIV reverse transcriptase; in hepatitis B DNA \n\npolymerase) that are essential for the viruses to reproduce themselves. In HIV Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nMylan should always be used combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency \n\nVirus) infection. The tablets are suitable for: \n\n• adults \n\n• adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who have already been treated with other HIV \n\nmedicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, or have \n\ncaused side effects. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an \n\ninfection with HBV (hepatitis B virus). The tablets are suitable for: \n\n• adults \n\n• adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years. \n\n \nYou do not have to have HIV to be treated with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan for HBV. \n\n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan you may \n\nstill develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You can also pass on HIV or \n\nHBV to others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan  \n\n \n\nDo not take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan: \n\n- If you are allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n\n \n\nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately and do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan \n\n \n\n• Take care not to infect other people. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \n\nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people. Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan does not \n\nreduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. \n\nYou must continue to take precautions to avoid this. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown \n\nproblems with your kidneys. Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be given to adolescents \n\nwith existing kidney problems. Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to \n\nassess your kidney function. Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may affect your kidneys during \n\ntreatment. Your doctor may order blood tests during treatment to monitor how your kidneys \n\nwork. If you are an adult, your doctor may advise you to take the tablets less often. Do not \n\nreduce the prescribed dose, unless your doctor has told you to do so. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your \n\nkidneys (see Other medicines and Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan). If this is unavoidable, your \n\ndoctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. \n\n \n• Bone problems. Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may \n\ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \n\nsupply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, \n\nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may \n\nbe some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint \n\nstiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \n\nmovement. If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \n\ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \n\nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have hepatitis B infection, \n\nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you. If you have a history of liver \n\ndisease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests to monitor your \n\nliver function. \n\n \n• Look out for infections. If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and have an infection, \n\nyou may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of an \n\nexisting infection once treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is started. These symptoms \n\nmay indicate that your body’s improved immune system is fighting infection. Look out for \n\nsigns of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. If \n\nyou notice signs of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor at once. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \n\nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \n\nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \n\nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk \n\nof the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to \n\nseek necessary treatment. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are over 65. Tenofovir disoproxil has not been \n\nstudied in patients over 65 years of age. If you are older than this and are prescribed \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan, your doctor will monitor you carefully. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are suitable for: \n\n• HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg and who \n\nhave already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due \n\nto development of resistance, or have caused side effects \n\n• HBV infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg. \n\n \nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: \n\n• Not for HIV-1 infected children under 12 years of age \n\n• Not for HBV infected children under 12 years of age.  \n\nFor dosage see section 3, How to take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. \n\nOther medicines and Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nDon’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your doctor when you start Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nMylan if you have both HBV and HIV. \n\n• Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan if you are already taking other medicines \n\ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nMylan together with medicines containing adefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat \n\nchronic hepatitis B). \n\n \n\n• It is very important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may damage \n\nyour kidneys. \n\n \n\nThese include: \n\n \n\n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), \n\n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection), \n\n• foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), \n\n• interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), \n\n• adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), \n\n• tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), \n\n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). \n\n \n\n• Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nMylan with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine \n\nin your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic \n\nacidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported \n\nwhen medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\ndoctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and \n\ndidanosine. \n\n \n\n• It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \n\nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil Mylan with food and drink \n\nTake Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n• You must not take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan during pregnancy unless specifically discussed \n\nwith your doctor. Although there are limited clinical data on the use of tenofovir disoproxil in \n\npregnant women, it is not usually used unless absolutely necessary. \n\n \n• Try to avoid getting pregnant during treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. You must \n\nuse an effective method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant. \n\n \n• If you become pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, ask your doctor about the potential \n\nbenefits and risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child. \n\n \n• If you have taken Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan during your pregnancy, your doctor may \n\nrequest regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. \n\nIn children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection \n\nagainst HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. \n\n \n• Do not breast-feed during treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. This is because the \n\nactive substance in this medicine passes into human breast milk. \n\n \n• If you are a woman with HIV or HBV do not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby \n\nin breast milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nTenofovir disoproxil can cause dizziness.

How to take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.

Then \nmix the powder with about 100 ml (half a glass) of water, orange juice or grape juice and drink \nimmediately \n\n \n• Always take the dose recommended by your doctor. This is to make sure that your medicine \n\nis fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. Do not change \n\nthe dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\n• If you are an adult and have problems with your kidneys, your doctor may advise you to \n\ntake Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan less frequently. \n\n \n\n• If you have HBV your doctor may offer you an HIV test to see if you have both HBV and \n\nHIV. Refer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how \n\nto take those medicines. \n\n \n\n• Other forms of this medicine may be more suitable for patients who have difficulty \n\nswallowing; ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take too many Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets, you may be at increased risk \n\nof experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with you so \n\nthat you can easily describe what you have taken. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan \n\nIt is important not to miss a dose of Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. If you miss a dose, work out how \n\nlong since you should have taken it. \n\n• If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take \n\nyour next dose at its regular time. \n\n \n• If it is more than 12 hours since you should have taken it, forget about the missed dose. Wait \n\nand take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \n\ntablet. \n\n \n\nIf you throw up less than 1 hour after taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, take another tablet. You \n\ndo not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nMylan \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan \n\nDon’t stop taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan without your doctor’s advice.

Some patients \n\nhave had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil. You may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. In some patients \n\nwith advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to \n\nworsening of your hepatitis. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor before you stop taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan for any reason, \n\nparticularly if you are experiencing any side effects or you have another illness. \n\n \n• Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n• Contact your doctor before you restart taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.
