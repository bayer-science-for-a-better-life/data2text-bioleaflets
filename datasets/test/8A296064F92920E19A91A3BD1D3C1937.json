CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nIntuniv is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children \n\nand adolescents 6-17 years old for whom stimulants are not suitable, not tolerated or have been shown \n\nto be ineffective. \n\n \n\nIntuniv must be used as a part of a comprehensive ADHD treatment programme, typically including \n\npsychological, educational and social measures. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment must be initiated under the supervision of an appropriate specialist in childhood and/or \n\nadolescent behavioural disorders. \n\n \n\nPre-treatment screening \n\n \n\nPrior to prescribing, it is necessary to conduct a baseline evaluation to identify patients at increased \n\nrisk of somnolence and sedation, hypotension and bradycardia, QT-prolongation arrhythmia and \n\nweight increase/risk of obesity. This evaluation should address a patient\u2019s cardiovascular status \n\nincluding blood pressure and heart rate, documenting comprehensive history of concomitant \n\nmedications, past and present co-morbid medical and psychiatric disorders or symptoms, family \n\nhistory of sudden cardiac/unexplained death and accurate recording of pre-treatment height and weight \n\non a growth chart (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nCareful dose titration and monitoring is necessary at the start of treatment since clinical improvement \n\nand risks for several clinically significant adverse reactions (syncope, hypotension, bradycardia, \n\nsomnolence and sedation) are dose- and exposure-related. Patients should be advised that somnolence \n\nand sedation can occur, particularly early in treatment or with dose increases. If somnolence and \n\nsedation are judged to be clinically concerning or persistent, a dose decrease or discontinuation should \n\nbe considered. \n\n \n\nFor all patients, the recommended starting dose is 1 mg of guanfacine, taken orally once a day. \n\n \n\nThe dose may be adjusted in increments of not more than 1 mg per week. Dose should be \n\nindividualised according to the patient\u2019s response and tolerability. \n\n \n\nDepending on the patient\u2019s response and tolerability for Intuniv the recommended maintenance dose \n\nrange is 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day. The recommended dose titration for children and adolescents is \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nprovided below (see tables 1 and 2). Dose adjustments (increase or decrease) to a maximum tolerated \n\ndose within the recommended optimal weight-adjusted dose range based upon clinical judgement of \n\nresponse and tolerability may occur at any weekly interval after the initial dose. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during titration \n\nDuring dose titration, weekly monitoring for signs and symptoms of somnolence and sedation, \n\nhypotension and bradycardia should be performed. \n\n \n\nOngoing monitoring \n\nDuring the first year of treatment, the patient should be assessed at least every 3 months for: \n\n\u2022 Signs and symptoms of: \no somnolence and sedation \no hypotension \no bradycardia \n\n\u2022 weight increase/risk of obesity \nIt is recommended clinical judgement be exercised during this period. 6 monthly monitoring should \n\nfollow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring following any dose adjustments (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\n \n\nDose titration schedule for children aged 6-12 years \n\nWeight Group  Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 \n\n25 kg and up  \n\nMax \n\nDose= 4 mg \n\n1 mg 2 mg 3 mg 4 mg \n\n \n\nTable 2 \n\n \n\nDose titration schedule for adolescents (aged 13-17 Years) \n\nWeight Groupa \nWeek \n\n1 \n\nWeek \n\n2 \n\nWeek \n\n3 \n\nWeek \n\n4 \nWeek 5 Week 6 Week 7 \n\n34-41.4 kg \n\nMax \n\nDose= 4 mg \n\n1 mg 2 mg 3 mg 4 mg    \n\n41.5-49.4 kg \n\nMax \n\nDose= 5 mg \n\n1 mg 2 mg 3 mg 4 mg 5 mg   \n\n49.5-58.4 kg \n\nMax \n\nDose= 6 mg \n\n1 mg 2 mg 3 mg 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg  \n\n58.5 kg and \n\nabove \n\nMax \n\nDose= 7 mg \n\n1 mg 2 mg 3 mg 4 mg 5 mg 6 mg 7 mgb \n\na Adolescent subjects must weigh at least 34 kg. \nb Adolescents weighing 58.5 kg and above may be titrated to a 7 mg/day dose after the \n\nsubject has completed a minimum of 1 week of therapy on a 6 mg/day dose and the \n\nphysician has performed a thorough review of the subject\u2019s tolerability and efficacy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nThe physician who elects to use guanfacine for extended periods (over 12 months) should re-evaluate \n\nthe usefulness of guanfacine every 3 months for the first year and then at least yearly based on clinical \n\njudgement (see section 4.4), and consider trial periods off medication to assess the patient\u2019s \n\nfunctioning without pharmacotherapy, preferably during times of school holidays. \n\n \n\nDownward titration and discontinuation \n\nPatients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue guanfacine without consulting their \n\nphysician. \n\n \n\nWhen stopping treatment, the dose must be tapered with decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to \n\n7 days, and blood pressure and pulse should be monitored in order to minimise potential withdrawal \n\neffects, in particular increases in blood pressure and heart rate (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn a maintenance of efficacy study, upon switching from guanfacine to placebo, 7/158 (4.4%) subjects \n\nexperienced increases in blood pressure to values above 5 mmHg and also above the 95th percentile for \n\nage, sex and stature (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMissed dose \n\nIf a dose is missed, the prescribed dose can resume the next day. If two or more consecutive doses are \n\nmissed, re-titration is recommended based on the patient\u2019s tolerability to guanfacine. \n\n \n\nSwitching from other formulations of guanfacine \n\nImmediate-release guanfacine tablets should not be substituted on a mg/mg basis, because of differing \n\npharmacokinetic profiles. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nAdults and elderly \n\nThe safety and efficacy of guanfacine in adult and the elderly with ADHD has not been established. \n\nTherefore, guanfacine should not be used in this group. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDose reduction may be required in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\nThe impact of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in paediatric patients \n\n(children and adolescents 6-17 years old) was not assessed. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDose reduction may be required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 29-15 ml/min) and an \n\nend stage renal disease (GFR<15 ml/min) or requiring dialysis. The impact of renal impairment on the \n\npharmacokinetics of guanfacine in paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old) was \n\nnot assessed (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nChildren under 6 years \n\nThe safety and efficacy of guanfacine in children aged less than 6 years have not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nPatients treated with CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitors/inducers \n\n \n\nCYP3A4/5 inhibitors have been shown to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nguanfacine when co-administered. Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of \n\nmoderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, grapefruit juice), or strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g., carbamazepine) (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\nIn case of concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors, a 50% reduction of the \n\nguanfacine dose is recommended. Due to variability in interaction effect, further dose titration may be \n\nneeded (see above).  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nIf guanfacine is combined with strong enzyme inducers, a retitration to increase the dose up to a \n\nmaximum daily dose of 7 mg may be considered if needed. If the inducing treatment is ended, \n\nretitration to reduce the guanfacine dose is recommended during the following weeks (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is taken once daily either morning or evening. Tablets should not be crushed, chewed or \n\nbroken before swallowing because this increases the rate of guanfacine release. \n\n \n\nTreatment is recommended only for children who are able to swallow the tablet whole without \n\nproblems. \n\n \n\nGuanfacine can be administered with or without food but should not be administered with high fat \n\nmeals, due to increased exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGuanfacine should not be administered together with grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHypotension, bradycardia and syncope \n\n \n\nGuanfacine can cause syncope, hypotension and bradycardia. Syncope may involve risks of falls or \n\naccidents, which could result in serious harm (see sections 4.8 and 4.7). \n\n \n\nPrior to initiation of treatment, patient\u2019s cardiovascular status including heart rate and blood pressure \n\nparameters, family history of sudden cardiac death/unexplained death, should be assessed to identify \n\npatients at increased risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and QT-prolongation/risk of arrhythmia. \n\nMonitoring of heart rate and blood pressure parameters should continue on a weekly basis during dose \n\ntitration and stabilisation and at least every 3 months for the first year, taking into consideration \n\nclinical judgement. 6 monthly monitoring should follow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring \n\nfollowing any dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised when treating patients with guanfacine who have a history of hypotension, heart \n\nblock, bradycardia, or cardiovascular disease, or who have a history of syncope or a condition that \n\nmay predispose them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or \n\ndehydration. Caution is also advised when treating patients who are being treated concomitantly with \n\nantihypertensives or other medicinal products that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase \n\nthe risk of syncope (see section 4.5). Patients should be advised to drink plenty of fluid. \n\n \n\nBlood pressure and heart rate increase upon discontinuation \n\n \n\nBlood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of guanfacine. In post-marketing \n\nexperience, hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation of \n\ntreatment (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure upon discontinuation, \n\nthe total daily dose should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days (see \n\nsection 4.2). Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nQTc interval \n\n \n\nIn phase II-III randomised double-blind monotherapy studies respective increases in QTc interval \n\nprolongation that exceeded change from baseline greater than >60 ms Fridericia-correction and \n\nBazett-correction were 0 (0.0%) and 2 (0.3%) among placebo and 1 (0.1%) and 1 (0.1%) among \n\nguanfacine patients. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. \n\n \n\nGuanfacine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a known history of QT prolongation, \n\nrisk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart block, bradycardia, hypokalaemia) or patients who are \n\ntaking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5). These patients should \n\nreceive further cardiac evaluation based on clinical judgement (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSedation and somnolence \n\n \n\nGuanfacine may cause somnolence and sedation predominantly at the start of treatment and could \n\ntypically last for 2-3 weeks and longer in some cases. It is therefore recommended that patients will be \n\nclosely monitored weekly during dose titration and stabilisation (see section 4.2), and every 3 months \n\nduring the first year, taking into consideration clinical judgement. Before guanfacine is used with any \n\nother centrally active depressants (such as alcohol, sedatives, phenothiazines, barbiturates, or \n\nbenzodiazepines) the potential for additive sedative effects should be considered (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients should not drink alcohol whilst taking guanfacine.  \n\n \n\nPatients are advised against operating heavy equipment, driving or cycling until they know how they \n\nrespond to treatment with guanfacine (see section 4.7). \n\n \n\nSuicidal ideation \n\n \n\nPatients with emergent suicidal ideation or behaviour during treatment for ADHD should be evaluated \n\nimmediately by their physician. Treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition may be necessary \n\nand consideration should be given to a possible change in the ADHD treatment programme. \n\n \n\nEffects on height, weight and Body Mass index (BMI) \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents treated with guanfacine may show an increase in their BMI. Therefore, \n\nmonitoring of height, weight and BMI should be done prior to initiation of therapy and then every \n\n3 months for the first year, taking into consideration clinical judgement. 6 monthly monitoring should \n\nfollow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring following any dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nIntuniv contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \n\ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\n\nfree\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nWhen guanfacine is used concomitantly with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers, plasma concentrations \n\nof guanfacine may be elevated or lowered, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of guanfacine. \n\nGuanfacine can increase plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered medicinal products that \n\nare metabolised via CYP3A4/5 (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is an in vitro inhibitor of MATE1 and the clinical relevance of MATE1 inhibition cannot \n\nbe excluded. Concomitant administration of guanfacine with MATE1 substrates may result in \n\nincreases in the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Furthermore, based on in vitro \n\nstudies, guanfacine may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. Concomitant \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nadministration of guanfacine with OCT1 substrates with a similar Tmax (e.g., metformin) may result in \n\nincreases in Cmax of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacodynamic effect of guanfacine can have an additive effect when taken with other \n\nproducts known to cause sedation, hypotension or QT prolongation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. However, the outcome is expected to be \n\nsimilar in the indicated paediatric age range. \n\n \n\nQT prolonging medicinal products \n\n \n\nGuanfacine causes a decrease in heart rate. Given the effect of guanfacine on heart rate, the \n\nconcomitant use of guanfacine with QT prolonging medicinal products is generally not recommended \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitors \n\n \n\nCaution should be used when guanfacine is administered to patients taking ketoconazole and other \n\nmoderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a decrease in the dose of guanfacine within the \n\nrecommended dose range is proposed (see section 4.2). Co-administration of guanfacine with \n\nmoderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors elevates plasma guanfacine concentrations and increases \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. There was a substantial \n\nincrease in the rate and extent of guanfacine exposure when administered with ketoconazole; the \n\nguanfacine peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and exposure (AUC) increased 2- and 3-fold, \n\nrespectively. Other CYP3A4/5 inhibitors may have a comparable effect, see table 3 for a list of \n\nexamples of moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, this list is not definitive. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n \n\nWhen patients are taking guanfacine concomitantly with a CYP3A4 inducer, an increase in the dose of \n\nguanfacine within the recommended dose range is proposed (see section 4.2). There was a significant \n\ndecrease in the rate and extent of guanfacine exposure when co-administered with rifampicin, a \n\nCYP3A4 inducer. The peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and exposure (AUC) of guanfacine \n\ndecreased by 54% and 70% respectively. Other CYP3A4 inducers may have a comparable effect, see \n\ntable 3 for a list of examples of CYP3A4/5 inducers, this list is not definitive. \n\n \n\nTable 3 \n\n \n\nModerate CYP3A4/5 \n\ninhibitors \n\nStrong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors CYP3A4 inducers \n\nAprepitant Boceprevir Bosentan \n\nAtazanavir Chloramphenicol Carbamazepine \n\nCiprofloxacin Clarithromycin Efavirenz \n\nCrizotinib Indinavir Etravirine \n\nDiltiazem Itraconazole Modafinil \n\nErythromycin Ketoconazole Nevirapine \n\nFluconazole Posaconazole Oxcarbazepine \n\nFosamprenavir Ritonavir Phenobarbital \n\nImatinib Saquinavir Phenytoin \n\nVerapamil Suboxone Primidone \n\nGrapefruit juice Telaprevir Rifabutin \n\n Telithromycin Rifampicin \n\n  St. John\u2019s wort \n\nSee section 4.2 for further dosing recommendations \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nValproic acid \n\n \n\nCo-administration of guanfacine and valproic acid can result in increased concentrations of valproic \n\nacid. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown, although both guanfacine and valproic acid are \n\nmetabolised by glucuronidation, possibly resulting in competitive inhibition. When guanfacine is \n\nco-administered with valproic acid, patients should be monitored for potential additive central nervous \n\nsystem (CNS) effects and consideration should be given to the monitoring of serum valproic acid \n\nconcentrations. Adjustments in the dose of valproic acid and guanfacine may be indicated when co-\n\nadministered. \n\n \n\nAntihypertensive medicinal products \n\n \n\nCaution should be used when guanfacine is administered concomitantly with antihypertensive \n\nmedicinal products, due to the potential for additive pharmacodynamic effects such as hypotension \n\nand syncope (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCNS depressant medicinal products \n\n \n\nCaution should be used when guanfacine is administered concomitantly with CNS depressant \n\nmedicinal products (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and \n\nantipsychotics) due to the potential for additive pharmacodynamic effects such as sedation and \n\nsomnolence (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nOral methylphenidate \n\n \n\nIn an interaction study, neither guanfacine nor Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS)-\n\nmethylphenidate HCl extended-release were found to affect the pharmacokinetics of the other \n\nmedicinal products when taken in combination. \n\n \n\nLisdexamfetamine dimesylate \n\n \n\nIn a drug interaction study, administration of guanfacine in combination with lisdexamfetamine \n\ndimesylate induced a 19% increase in guanfacine maximum plasma concentrations, whereas exposure \n\n(AUC) was increased by 7%. These small changes are not expected to be clinically meaningful. In this \n\nstudy, no effect on d-amphetamine exposure was observed following combination of guanfacine and \n\nlisdexamfetamine dimesylate. \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\n \n\nGuanfacine should not be administered with high fat meals due to increased exposure, as it has been \n\nshown that high fat meals have a significant effect on the absorption of guanfacine (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of guanfacine in pregnant women. \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nGuanfacine is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether guanfacine and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic and toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of guanfacine \n\nand its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, a risk on the breast-fed infant cannot be \n\nexcluded. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue and/or abstain from \n\nguanfacine therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data regarding effect on fertility from the use of guanfacine in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies indicate an effect on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nGuanfacine may have a moderate to severe influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\nGuanfacine can cause dizziness and somnolence. These effects occur predominantly at the start of \n\ntreatment and may occur less frequently as treatment continues. Syncope has also been observed.  \n\nPatients should be warned of these possible effects and be advised that if affected, they should avoid \n\nthese activities (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions include somnolence (40.6%), headache (27.4%), \n\nfatigue (18.1%), abdominal pain upper (12.0%), and sedation (10.2%). The most serious adverse \n\nreactions commonly reported include hypotension (3.2%), weight increase (2.9%), bradycardia (1.5%) \n\nand syncope (0.7%). The adverse reactions somnolence and sedation occurred predominantly at the \n\nstart of treatment and may typically last for 2-3 weeks and longer in some cases. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following table presents all adverse reactions based on clinical trials and spontaneous reporting. \n\nAll adverse reactions from post-marketing experience are italicised. \n\n \n\nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: \n\nvery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 \n\nto <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 4.

Bradycardia occurred in 1.5%, hypotension in 3.2% and syncope \n\noccurred in 0.7% of all guanfacine-treated patients. The occurrence of somnolence/sedation and \n\nhypotension was most prominent in the first few weeks of treatment and diminished gradually \n\nthereafter. \n\n \n\nEffects on height, weight and body Mass index (BMI) \n\nCareful follow-up for weight suggests that children and adolescents who took guanfacine in the study \n\n(i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have demonstrated by an age- and \n\nsex-normalised mean change from baseline in BMI percentile, 4.3 over 1 year (average percentiles at \n\nbaseline and 12 months were 68.3 and 73.1, respectively). Consequently, as part of routine monitoring \n\nheight, weight and BMI should be monitored at the start of treatment and every 3 months during the \n\nfirst year, then 6 monthly taking into consideration clinical judgement with maintenance of a growth \n\nchart. \n\n \n\nThorough QT /QTc study \n\nThe effect of 2 dose levels of immediate-release guanfacine (4 mg and 8 mg) on QT interval was \n\nevaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, cross-over study in healthy \n\nadults. An apparent increase in mean QTc was observed for both doses. This finding has no known \n\nclinical relevance. \n\n \n\nIn phase II-III randomised double-blind monotherapy studies respective increases in QTc interval \n\nprolongation that exceeded change from baseline greater than 60 ms Fridericia-correction and \n\nBazett-correction were 0 (0.0%) and 2 (0.3%) among placebo and 1 (0.1%) and 1 (0.1%) among \n\nguanfacine patients. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. \n\n \n\nBlood pressure and heart rate increase upon discontinuation of guanfacine \n\nBlood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of guanfacine. In post-marketing \n\nexperience, hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation of \n\nguanfacine (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents, increases in mean systolic and diastolic \n\nblood pressure of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, above original baseline were \n\nobserved upon discontinuation of guanfacine. However, individuals may have larger increases than \n\nreflected by the mean changes. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nthe end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 5.1). \n\n \n\nAdult patients \n\n \n\nGuanfacine has not been studied in adults with ADHD. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms of overdose may include hypotension, initial hypertension, bradycardia, lethargy, \n\nand respiratory depression. Haemodynamic instability has also been associated with a guanfacine \n\noverdose 3 times the recommended daily dose. Management of guanfacine overdose should include \n\nmonitoring for and treatment of these signs and symptoms. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old inclusive) who develop lethargy should be \n\nobserved for the development of more serious toxicity including coma, bradycardia, and hypotension \n\nfor up to 24 hours, due to the possibility of delayed onset of these symptoms. \n\n \n\nTreatment of overdose may include gastric lavage if it is performed soon after ingestion. Activated \n\ncharcoal may be useful in limiting the absorption. Guanfacine is not dialysable in clinically significant \n\namounts (2.4%). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihypertensives, antiadrenergic agents, centrally acting ATC code: \n\nC02AC02. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is a selective alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has 15-20 times higher affinity \n\nfor this receptor subtype than for the alpha2B or alpha2C subtypes. Guanfacine is a non-stimulant. The \n\nmode of action of guanfacine in ADHD is not fully established. Preclinical research suggests \n\nguanfacine modulates signalling in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia through direct modification \n\nof synaptic noradrenalin transmission at the alpha2A-adrenergic receptors. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is a known antihypertensive agent. By stimulating alpha2A-adrenergic receptors, \n\nguanfacine reduces sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor centre to the heart and blood \n\nvessels. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure, and a reduction \n\nin heart rate. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe effects of guanfacine in the treatment of ADHD has been examined in 5 controlled studies in \n\nchildren and adolescents (6 to 17 years), 3 short-term controlled trials in children and adolescents aged \n\n6 to 17 years, 1 short-term controlled study in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years, and 1 randomised \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nwithdrawal trial in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years, all of whom met the DSM-IV-TR criteria \nfor ADHD. The majority of patients achieved an optimised dose between 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day. \n \n\nThree hundred and thirty-seven patients aged 6-17 years were evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 Study \n\nSPD503-316, to assess safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing (children:1-4 mg/day, adolescents: \n1-7 mg/day). In this 12-week (6-12 years) or 15-week (13-17 years), randomised, double-blind, \n\nparallel-group, placebo- and active-reference (atomoxetine), dose-titration study, guanfacine showed \n\nsignificantly greater efficacy than placebo on symptoms of ADHD based upon investigator ratings on \n\nthe ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). The ADHD Rating Scale is a measure of the core symptoms of \n\nADHD. The results with respect to the primary endpoint study are presented in Table 5. \n\n \n\nTable 5.

The percentages \n\nof subjects who met response criteria (\u226530% reduction from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV Total Score \n\nand a CGI-I value of 1 or 2) was 64.3% for guanfacine, 55.4% for atomoxetine and 42.3% for placebo. \n\nGuanfacine also showed significant improvement in learning, school and family functioning as \n\nmeasured with the (WFIRS-P score). \n \n\nIn addition a 15-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation study \n\n(SPD503-312) conducted in adolescents aged 13-17 years (n=314) to confirm the efficacy, safety, and \n\ntolerability of guanfacine (1-7 mg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine showed a significantly \n\ngreater improvement in the ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with subjects receiving placebo. \n\nGuanfacine-treated patients were in statistically significantly better conditions on the functional \n\noutcome as measured by the clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) at endpoint compared to \n\nplacebo-treated patients. Superiority (statistical significance) over placebo on the family and school, \n\nand learning domains of the WFIRS-P score was not established in this study. \n\n \n\nStudy (SPD503-315) was a 41 week long term maintenance of efficacy study which included an \n\nopen-label phase (up to 13 weeks) followed by double-blind, placebo-controlled, \n\nrandomised-withdrawal phase (up to 26 weeks), conducted in paediatric patients (children and \n\nadolescents aged 6-17 years old inclusive) (n=526 in the open-label phase and n=315 in the \n\ndouble-blind randomised-withdrawal phase) to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of \n\nonce-daily dosing with guanfacine (children: 1-4 mg/day, adolescents:1-7 mg/day) in the treatment of \n\nADHD. Guanfacine was superior to placebo in the long-term maintenance of treatment in children and \n\nadolescents with ADHD as measured by cumulative treatment failures (49.3% for guanfacine, and \n\n64.9% for placebo, p=0.006). Treatment failure was defined as a \u226550% increase in ADHD-RS-IV total \n\nscore and a \u22652 point increase in CGI-S score compared to the respective scores at the double-blind \n\nbaseline visit. At the end of their double-blind treatment, a significantly larger proportion of subjects \n\nin the guanfacine compared with placebo group were normal or borderline mentally ill as measured by \n\nthe clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) that includes assessment of functioning. Superiority \n\n(statistical significance) over placebo on the family and school, and learning domains of the WFIRS-P \n\nscore was not consistently established in this study. \n\n \n\nSimilar results for the efficacy of guanfacine in the treatment of ADHD were established in \n\n2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose (range of 1-4 mg/day) monotherapy trials \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nin paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old inclusive). Studies SPD503-301 and \n\nSPD503-304 were 8 and 9 weeks in duration, respectively, both conducted in the United States. \n\nGuanfacine showed significantly greater improvement compared to placebo on the change from \n\nbaseline to final on treatment assessment in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) score in both \n\nstudies (placebo-adjusted reduction in LS mean range from 5.4 to 10.0, p<0.02). \n\n \n\nStudy SPD503-314 was conducted in children aged 6-12 years to assess the efficacy of once daily \n\ndosing with guanfacine (1-4 mg) administered either in the morning or the evening. This was a \n\ndouble-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation study, 9-weeks in duration conducted \n\nin the United States and Canada. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated as the change from baseline to \n\nweek 8 (final on treatment assessment) in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) total scores. \n\nGuanfacine showed significantly greater improvement compared to placebo regardless of time (AM or \n\nPM) of administration (placebo-adjusted LS mean difference of -9.4 and -9.8 for AM and PM dosing, \n\nrespectively, p<0.001). \n\n \n\nCo-administration with psychostimulants \n\nThe effect of co-administration with psychostimulants was examined in an add-on study in partial \n\nresponders to psychostimulants. The study was double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, \n\nmulti-centre, dose-optimisation 9-weeks study. It was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \n\nguanfacine (1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/day) when co-administered with long-acting psychostimulants \n\n(amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate) in children and adolescents \n\naged 6-17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD and a suboptimal, partial response to psychostimulants. \n\nSuboptimal response was defined as an ADHD-RS-IV total score of \u226524 and a CGI-S score \u22653 at \n\nscreening and baseline. The primary efficacy assessment was the ADHD-RS-IV total score. \n\nThe results showed that patients treated with add-on guanfacine improved more on the ADHD-RS-IV \n\ncompared to those treated with add-on placebo (20.7 (12.6) points vs. 15.9 (11.8); difference: 4.9 \n\n(95% CI 2.6, 7.2). No age differences were observed with respect to response to the ADHD-RS-IV. \n\n \n\nADHD with oppositional symptoms study \n\nStudy SPD503-307 was a 9-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation \n\nstudy with guanfacine (1-4 mg/day) conducted in children aged 6-12 years with ADHD and \n\noppositional symptoms (n=217). Oppositional symptoms were evaluated as the change from baseline \n\nto endpoint in the Oppositional Subscale of the Conners\u2019 Parent Rating Scale \u2013 revised Long Form \n\n(CPRS-R:L) score. Results show statistically significantly (p\u22640.05) greater mean reductions at \n\nendpoint from Baseline (indicating improvement) in oppositional subscale of CPRS-R:L scores in the \n\nguanfacine group compared to placebo (10.9 points vs. 6.8 for guanfacine vs. placebo, respectively) \n\nand the effect size was 0.6 (p<0.001). These reductions represent a percentage reduction of 56% vs. \n\n33% for guanfacine vs. placebo, respectively. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is readily absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations reached approximately 5 hours after \n\noral administration in paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old inclusive). In adults, \n\nthe mean exposure of guanfacine increased (Cmax ~75% and AUC ~40%) when guanfacine was taken \n\ntogether with a high fat meal, compared to intake in the fasted state (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is moderately bound to plasma proteins (approximately 70%), independent of active \n\nsubstance concentration. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is metabolised via CYP3A4/5-mediated oxidation, with subsequent phase II reactions of \n\nsulfation and glucuronidation. The major circulating metabolite is 3-OH-guanfacine sulfate which \n\nlacks pharmacological activity. \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and exposure is affected by CYP3A4 and \n\nCYP3A5 inducers and inhibitors. In human hepatic microsomes, guanfacine did not inhibit the \n\nactivities of the other major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 or CYP3A5); guanfacine is also not expected to be an inducer of \n\nCYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies, guanfacine is a substrate of OCT1 and OCT2, but not BCRP, OATP1B1, \n\nOATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2. Guanfacine is not an inhibitor of BSEP, MRP2, \n\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or MATE2K, but it is an inhibitor of MATE1 and may \n\nbe an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nGuanfacine is cleared by the kidneys via filtration and active secretion and the liver. Active renal \n\nsecretion is mediated via OCT2 transporter. At least 50% of the clearance of guanfacine is hepatic. \n\nRenal excretion is the major elimination pathway (80%) with parent active substance accounting for \n\n30% of the urinary radioactivity. The major urinary metabolites were 3-hydroxy guanfacine \n\nglucuronide, guanfacine dihydrodiol, 3-hydroxy guanfacine sulfate. The elimination half-life of \n\nguanfacine is approximately 18 hours. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of guanfacine is similar in children (aged 6 to 12) and adolescents (aged \n\n13 to 17) ADHD patients, and healthy adult volunteers. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nThere have been no studies performed in children with ADHD under the age of 6 years with \n\nguanfacine. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to guanfacine is similar for men and women given the same mg/kg dose. \n\n \n\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies for race have not been conducted. There is no evidence of any impact \n\nof ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenic effect of guanfacine was observed in studies of 78 weeks in mice at doses up to \n\n10 mg/kg/day. A significant increase in incidence of adenomas of the pancreatic islet was observed in \n\nmale rats treated with 5 mg/kg/day guanfacine for 102 weeks but not in female rats. The clinical \n\nrelevance is unknown. \n\n \n\nGuanfacine was not genotoxic in a variety of test models, including the Ames test and an in vitro \n\nchromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nGeneral toxicity observed in animals (rat, dog) upon treatment with guanfacine included prolongation \n\nof uncorrected QT interval (heart), atrophic spleen and decreased white blood cells, affected liver \u2013 \n\nincreased bilirubin and ALT levels included, irritated and inflamed intestines, increased creatinine and \n\nblood urea nitrogen levels (kidney), corneal clouding (eye) in rat and mouse only, alveolar \n\nmacrophage infiltration & pneumonitis and reduced spermatogenesis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nNo adverse effects were observed in a fertility study in female rats at doses up to 22 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. \n\n \n\nMale fertility was affected at 8 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose tested, equivalent of 10.8 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose of 0.12 mg/kg on a mg/m2 basis. Due to lack of proper \n\ntoxicokinetic data, comparison to human clinical exposure was not possible. \n\n \n\nGuanfacine showed embryo foetal developmental toxicity in mice and rats (NOAEL 0.5 mg/kg/day) \n\nand in rabbits (NOAEL 3.0 mg/kg/day) in the presence of maternal toxicity. Due to a lack of proper \n\ntoxicokinetic data, comparison to human clinical exposure was not possible. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Your doctor may increase your dose based on your \nbody weight and how Intuniv is working for you but not by more than 1 mg per week. \n\nDepending on how you respond to treatment your doctor may increase your dose more slowly. \n\nThe recommended maintenance dose is between 0.05 up to 0.12 mg per kg of bodyweight per \n\nday. \n\n\u2022 You may not notice an immediate effect upon starting treatment, some patients may notice an \nimprovement after the first week but it could take longer. \n\n\u2022 Your daily dose will be between 1 and 7 mg depending on your age and how you respond to \nIntuniv, but not more that 7 mg. \n\n \n\nHow to take Intuniv \n\n \n\n\u2022 This medicine should be taken once a day either in the morning or evening. \n\n\u2022 It can be taken with or without food, but do not take it with fatty foods (e.g., high fat breakfast). \n\n\u2022 Swallow the tablet whole with a drink of water or other liquid (but not grapefruit juice). \n\n\u2022 Do not break, crush or chew the tablet; this will affect how the tablet works. Tell your doctor if \nyou cannot swallow the tablet whole. \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\n \n\nIf you need to take Intuniv for more than a year your doctor will monitor your response to treatment \n\nand your doctor may stop the medicine for a short time; this may happen during a school holiday. This \n\nwill show if you still need to take the medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nIf you take more Intuniv than you should \n\n \n\nIf you take more Intuniv than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the \n\nmedicine pack with you and tell them how much you have taken. \n\n \n\nThe following effects may happen: low or high blood pressure, slow heart rate, slow breathing rate, \n\nfeeling tired or exhausted. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Intuniv \n\n \n\nIf you forget a dose, wait until the next day and take your usual dose. \n\n\u2022 If you have missed two or more doses talk to your doctor as you may need to restart Intuniv \nwith a lower dose. \n\n\u2022 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop taking Intuniv \n\n \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor. \n\n\u2022 If you stop taking this medicine your blood pressure and heart rate may increase (see section 4 \nbelow). \n\n\u2022 To stop the medicine, your doctor will slowly reduce your Intuniv dose to minimise any side \neffects. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

the supervision of an appropriate specialist in childhood and/or adolescent behavioural disorders. always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. as part of your treatment your doctor will closely monitor how intuniv is affecting you during initial dosing and/or dose adjustments. how much to take your doctor will start you on 1 mg per day. your doctor may increase your dose based on your body weight and how intuniv is working for you but not by more than 1 mg per week. depending on how you respond to treatment your doctor may increase your dose more slowly. the recommended maintenance dose is between 0.05 up to 0.12 mg per kg of bodyweight per day. you may not notice an immediate effect upon starting treatment, some patients may notice an improvement after the first week but it could take longer. your daily dose will be between 1 and 7 mg depending on your age and how you respond to intuniv, but not more that 7 mg. how to take intuniv this medicine should be taken once a day either in the morning or evening. it can be taken with or without food, but do not take it with fatty foods (e.g., high fat breakfast). swallow the tablet whole with a drink of water or other liquid (but not grapefruit juice). do not break, crush or chew the tablet; this will affect how the tablet works. tell your doctor if you cannot swallow the tablet whole. duration of treatment if you need to take intuniv for more than a year your doctor will monitor your response to treatment and your doctor may stop the medicine for a short time; this may happen during a school holiday. this will show if you still need to take the medicine. if you take more intuniv than you should if you take more intuniv than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. take the medicine pack with you and tell them how much you have taken. the following effects may happen: low or high blood pressure, slow heart rate, slow breathing rate, feeling tired or exhausted. if you forget to take intuniv if you forget a dose, wait until the next day and take your usual dose. if you have missed two or more doses talk to your doctor as you may need to restart intuniv with a lower dose. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop taking intuniv do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor. if you stop taking this medicine your blood pressure and heart rate may increase (see section 4 below). to stop the medicine, your doctor will slowly reduce your intuniv dose to minimise any side effects. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "intuniv",
