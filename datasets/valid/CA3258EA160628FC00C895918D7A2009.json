This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nEvoltra 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of clofarabine. \n\nEach 20 ml vial contains 20 mg of clofarabine. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect  \n\nEach 20 ml vial contains 180 mg of sodium chloride. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n\n \n\nClear, practically colourless solution with a pH of 4.5 to 7.5 and an osmolarity of 270 to 310 mOsm/l. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients who have relapsed or are \n\nrefractory after receiving at least two prior regimens and where there is no other treatment option \n\nanticipated to result in a durable response. Safety and efficacy have been assessed in studies of \n\npatients \u2264 21 years old at initial diagnosis (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients \n\nwith acute leukaemias. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdult population (including elderly) \n\nThere are currently insufficient data to establish the safety and efficacy of clofarabine in adult patients \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (\u2265 1 year old)  \n\nThe recommended dose in monotherapy is 52 mg/m2 of body surface area administered by \n\nintravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days. Body surface area must be calculated \n\nusing the actual height and weight of the patient before the start of each cycle.  Treatment cycles \n\nshould be repeated every 2 to 6 weeks (from the starting day of the previous cycle) following recovery \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nof normal haematopoiesis (i.e. ANC \u2265 0.75 \u00d7 109/l) and return to baseline organ function. A 25% dose \n\nreduction may be warranted in patients experiencing significant toxicities (see below). There is \n\ncurrently limited experience of patients receiving more than 3 treatment cycles (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe majority of patients who respond to clofarabine achieve a response after 1 or 2 treatment cycles \n\n(see section 5.1). Therefore, the potential benefit and risks associated with continued therapy in \n\npatients who do not show haematological and/or clinical improvement after 2 treatment cycles should \n\nbe assessed by the treating physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nChildren weighing < 20 kg \n\nAn infusion time of > 2 hours should be considered to help reduce symptoms of anxiety and \n\nirritability, and to avoid unduly high maximum concentrations of clofarabine (see section 5.2). \n\n \nChildren < 1 year old \n\n There are no data on the pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy of clofarabine in infants. Therefore, a \n\nsafe and effective dosage recommendation for patients < 1 year old has yet to be established. \n\n \n\nDose reduction for patients experiencing haematological toxicities  \n\n \n\nIf the ANC does not recover by 6 weeks from the start of a treatment cycle, a bone marrow aspirate / \n\nbiopsy should be performed to determine possible refractory disease.  If persistent leukaemia is not \n\nevident, it is recommended that the dose for the next cycle be reduced by 25% of the previous dose \n\nfollowing recovery of ANC to \u2265 0.75 \u00d7 109/l. Should patients experience an ANC < 0.5 \u00d7 109/l for \n\nmore than 4 weeks from the start of the last cycle, it is recommended that the dose for the next cycle \n\nbe reduced by 25%.  \n\n \n\nDose reduction for patients experiencing non-haematological toxicities \n\nInfectious events  \n\nIf a patient develops a clinically significant infection, clofarabine treatment may be withheld until the \n\ninfection is clinically controlled. At this time, treatment may be reinitiated at the full dose. In the \n\nevent of a second clinically significant infection, clofarabine treatment should be withheld until the \n\ninfection is clinically controlled and may be reinitiated at a 25% dose reduction. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious events  \n\nIf a patient experiences one or more severe toxicities (US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common \n\nToxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 toxicities excluding nausea and vomiting), treatment should be \n\ndelayed until the toxicities resolve to baseline parameters or to the point where they are no longer \n\nsevere and the potential benefit of continued treatment with clofarabine outweighs the risk of such \n\ncontinuation. It is then recommended that clofarabine be administered at a 25% dose reduction. \n\n \n\nShould a patient experience the same severe toxicity on a second occasion, treatment should be \n\ndelayed until the toxicity resolves to baseline parameters or to the point where it is no longer severe \n\nand the potential benefit of continued treatment with clofarabine outweighs the risk of such \n\ncontinuation. It is then recommended that clofarabine be administered at a further 25% dose \n\nreduction.  \n\n \n\nAny patient who experiences a severe toxicity on a third occasion, a severe toxicity that does not \n\nrecover within 14 days (see above for exclusions), or a life-threatening or disabling toxicity (US NCI \n\nCTC Grade 4 toxicity) should be withdrawn from treatment with clofarabine (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe limited data available indicate that clofarabine may accumulate in patients with decreased \n\ncreatinine clearance (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Clofarabine is contraindicated in patients with severe \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nrenal insufficiency (see section 4.3) and should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal insufficiency (see section 4.4).   \n\n \n\nPatients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 < 60 ml/min) require a 50% dose \n\nreduction (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN plus AST \n\nand ALT > 5 x ULN) and the liver is a potential target organ for toxicity. Therefore, clofarabine is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) and should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage should be administered by intravenous infusion although it has been \n\nadministered via a central venous catheter in ongoing clinical trials. Evoltra must not be mixed with or \n\nconcomitantly administered using the same intravenous line as other medicinal products (see \n\nsection 6.2). For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration (see \n\nsection 6.6). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with severe renal insufficiency or severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nEvoltra is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant haematological and \n\nnon-haematological adverse reactions (see section 4.8).   \n\n \n\nThe following parameters should be closely monitored in patients undergoing treatment with \n\nclofarabine: \n\n\u2022 Complete blood and platelet counts should be obtained at regular intervals, more frequently in \n\npatients who develop cytopaenias. \n\n\u2022 Renal and hepatic function prior to, during active treatment and following therapy. Clofarabine \n\nshould be discontinued immediately if substantial increases in creatinine, liver enzymes and/or \n\nbilirubin are observed. \n\n\u2022 Respiratory status, blood pressure, fluid balance and weight throughout and immediately after the \n\n5 day clofarabine administration period. \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic disorders \n\nSuppression of bone marrow should be anticipated. This is usually reversible and appears to be dose-\n\ndependent. Severe bone marrow suppression, including neutropaenia, anaemia and thrombocytopaenia \n\nhave been observed in patients treated with clofarabine. Haemorrhage, including cerebral, \n\ngastrointestinal and pulmonary haemorrhage, has been reported and may be fatal. The majority of the \n\ncases were associated with thrombocytopaenia (see section 4.8). \n\nIn addition, at initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had haematological \n\nimpairment as a manifestation of leukaemia. Because of the pre-existing immuno-compromised \n\ncondition of these patients and prolonged neutropaenia that can result from treatment with \n\nclofarabine, patients are at increased risk for severe opportunistic infections, including severe sepsis, \n\nwith potentially fatal outcomes. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and \n\ntreated promptly.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nOccurrences of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis, caecitis, and C. difficile colitis, have been \n\nreported during treatment with clofarabine. This has occurred more frequently within 30 days of \n\ntreatment, and in the setting of combination chemotherapy. Enterocolitis may lead to necrosis, \n\nperforation or sepsis complications and may be associated with fatal outcome (see section 4.8). \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis.  \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), including fatal cases, have \n\nbeen reported (see section 4.8). Clofarabine must be discontinued for exfoliative or bullous rash, or if \n\nSJS or TEN is suspected. \n\n \n\nNeoplasms benign and malignant (including cysts and polyps) and Immune systems disorders \n\nAdministration of clofarabine results in a rapid reduction in peripheral leukaemia cells. Patients \n\nundergoing treatment with clofarabine should be evaluated and monitored for signs and symptoms of \n\ntumour lysis syndrome and cytokine release (e.g. tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, pulmonary \n\noedema) that could develop into Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), capillary leak \n\nsyndrome and/or organ dysfunction (see section 4.8).  \n\n\u2022 Prophylactic administration of allopurinol should be considered if hyperuricemia (tumour lysis) is \n\nexpected. \n\n\u2022 Patients should receive intravenous fluids throughout the 5 day clofarabine administration period \n\nto reduce the effects of tumour lysis and other events. \n\n\u2022 The use of prophylactic steroids (e.g., 100 mg/m2 hydrocortisone on Days 1 through 3) may be of \n\nbenefit in preventing signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak.  \n\n \n\nClofarabine should be discontinued immediately if patients show early signs or symptoms of SIRS, \n\ncapillary leak syndrome or substantial organ dysfunction and appropriate supportive measures \n\ninstituted. In addition, clofarabine treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops \n\nhypotension for any reason during the 5 days of administration. Further treatment with clofarabine, \n\ngenerally at a lower dose, can be considered when patients are stabilised and organ function has \n\nreturned to baseline.  \n\n \n\nThe majority of patients who respond to clofarabine achieve a response after 1 or 2 treatment cycles \n\n(see section 5.1). Therefore, the potential benefit and risks associated with continued therapy in \n\npatients who do not show haematological and/or clinical improvement after 2 treatment cycles should \n\nbe assessed by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nPatients with cardiac disease and those taking medicinal products known to affect blood pressure or \n\ncardiac function should be closely monitored during treatment with clofarabine (see sections 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nThere is no clinical study experience in paediatric patients with renal insufficiency (defined in clinical \n\nstudies as serum creatinine \u2265 2 x ULN for age) and clofarabine is predominately excreted via the \n\nkidneys. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that clofarabine may accumulate in patients with decreased \n\ncreatinine clearance (see section 5.2). Therefore, clofarabine should be used with caution in patients \n\nwith mild to moderate renal insufficiency (see section 4.2 for dose adjustments). The safety profile of \n\nclofarabine has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment or patients receiving \n\nrenal replacement therapy (see section 4.3). The concomitant use of medicinal products that have been \n\nassociated with renal toxicity and those eliminated by tubular secretion such as NSAIDs, \n\namphotericin B, methotrexate, aminosides, organoplatines, foscarnet, pentamidine, cyclosporin, \n\ntacrolimus, acyclovir and valganciclovir, should be avoided particularly during the 5 day clofarabine \n\nadministration period; preference should be given to those medicinal products that are not known to \n\nbe nephrotoxic (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Renal failure or acute renal failure have been observed as a \n\nconsequence of infections, sepsis and tumour lysis syndrome (see section 4.8). Patients should be \n\nmonitored for renal toxicity and clofarabine should be discontinued as necessary. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nIt was observed that the frequency and severity of adverse reactions, in particular infection, \n\nmyelosuppression (neutropenia) and hepatotoxicity, are increased when clofarabine is used in \n\ncombination. In this regard, patients should be closely monitored when clofarabine is used in \n\ncombined regimens. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving clofarabine may experience vomiting and diarrhoea; they should, therefore, be \n\nadvised regarding appropriate measures to avoid dehydration. Patients should be instructed to seek \n\nmedical advice if they experience symptoms of dizziness, fainting spells, or decreased urine output. \n\nProphylactic anti-emetic medicinal products should be considered. \n\n \n\nHepato biliary disorders \n\nThere is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN plus AST \n\nand ALT > 5 x ULN) and the liver is a potential target organ for toxicity. Therefore, clofarabine \n\nshould be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.3). The concomitant use of medicinal products that have been associated with \n\nhepatic toxicity should be avoided wherever possible (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\nIf a patient experiences a hematologic toxicity of Grade 4 neutropaenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l) lasting \n\n\u2265 4 weeks, then the dose should be reduced by 25% for the next cycle. \n\n \n\nAny patient who experiences a severe non-hematologic toxicity (US NCI CTC Grade 3 toxicity) on a \n\nthird occasion, a severe toxicity that does not recover within 14 days (excluding nausea/vomiting) or a \n\nlife-threatening or disabling non-infectious non-hematologic toxicity (US NCI CTC Grade 4 toxicity) \n\nshould be withdrawn from treatment with clofarabine (see section 4.2). \n\n  \n\nPatients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be at higher \n\nrisk for hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) following treatment with \n\nclofarabine (40 mg/m2) when used in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide \n\n(440 mg/m2). In the post-marketing period, following treatment with clofarabine, serious hepatotoxic \n\nadverse reactions of VOD in paediatric and adult patients have been associated with a fatal outcome. \n\nCases of hepatitis and hepatic failure, including fatal outcomes, have been reported with clofarabine \n\ntreatment (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMost patients received conditioning regimens that included busulfan, melphalan, and/or the \n\ncombination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Severe hepatotoxic events have been \n\nreported in a Phase 1/2 combination study of clofarabine in paediatric patients with relapsed or \n\nrefractory acute leukaemia.  \n\n \n\nThere are currently limited data on the safety and efficacy of clofarabine when administered for more \n\nthan 3 treatment cycles. \n\n \n\nEach vial of Evoltra contains 180 mg of sodium chloride. This is equivalent to 3.08 mmol (or \n\n70.77 mg) of sodium and should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. However, there are no known clinically significant \n\ninteractions with other medicinal products or laboratory tests. \n\n \n\nClofarabine is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system.  Therefore, \n\nit is unlikely to interact with active substances which inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In \n\naddition, clofarabine is unlikely to inhibit any of the major 5 human CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, \n\n2D6 and 3A4) or to induce 2 of these isoforms (1A2 and 3A4) at the plasma concentrations achieved \n\nfollowing intravenous infusion of 52 mg/m2/day.  As a result, it is not expected to affect the \n\nmetabolism of active substances which are known substrates for these enzymes. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nClofarabine is predominately excreted via the kidneys. Thus, the concomitant use of medicinal \n\nproducts that have been associated with renal toxicity and those eliminated by tubular secretion such \n\nas NSAIDs, amphotericin B, methotrexate, aminosides, organoplatines, foscarnet, pentamidine, \n\ncyclosporin, tacrolimus, acyclovir and valganciclovir, should be avoided particularly during the 5 day \n\nclofarabine administration period (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).   \n\n \n\nThe liver is a potential target organ for toxicity. Thus, the concomitant use of medicinal products that \n\nhave been associated with hepatic toxicity should be avoided wherever possible (see sections 4.4 and \n\n4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients taking medicinal products known to affect blood pressure or cardiac function should be \n\nclosely monitored during treatment with clofarabine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\n \n\nFemales of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use effective methods of \n\ncontraception during treatment.   \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the use of clofarabine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity including teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Clofarabine may cause serious birth \n\ndefects when administered during pregnancy. Therefore, Evoltra should not be used during \n\npregnancy, especially not during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary (i.e. only if the potential \n\nbenefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the foetus). If a patient becomes pregnant during treatment \n\nwith clofarabine, they should be informed of the possible hazard to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether clofarabine or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. The excretion \n\nof clofarabine in milk has not been studied in animals. However, because of the potential for serious \n\nadverse reactions in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to, during and \n\nfollowing treatment with Evoltra (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nDose related toxicities on male reproductive organs have been observed in mice, rats and dogs, and \n\ntoxicities on female reproductive organs have been observed in mice (see section 5.3). As the effect of \n\nclofarabine treatment on human fertility is unknown, reproductive planning should be discussed with \n\npatients as appropriate. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects of clofarabine on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \n\nHowever, patients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as dizziness, \n\nlight-headedness or fainting spells during treatment and told not to drive or operate machines in such \n\ncircumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nNearly all patients (98%) experienced at least one adverse event considered by the study investigator \n\nto be related to clofarabine.  Those most frequently reported were nausea (61% of patients), vomiting \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n(59%), febrile neutropaenia (35%), headache (24%), rash (21%), diarrhoea (20%), pruritus (20%), \n\npyrexia (19%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (15%), fatigue (14%), anxiety (12%), \n\nmucosal inflammation (11%), and flushing (11%).  Sixty-eight patients (59%) experienced at least \n\none serious clofarabine-related adverse event. One patient discontinued treatment due to grade 4 \n\nhyperbilirubinaemia considered as related to clofarabine after receiving 52 mg/m2/day clofarabine. \n\nThree patients died of adverse events considered by the study investigator to be related to treatment \n\nwith clofarabine: one patient died from respiratory distress, hepatocellular damage, and capillary leak \n\nsyndrome; one patient from VRE sepsis and multi-organ failure; and one patient from septic shock \n\nand multi-organ failure. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe information provided is based on data generated from clinical trials in which 115 patients (> 1 \n\nand \u2264  21 years old) with either ALL or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) received at least one dose of \n\nclofarabine at the recommended dose of 52 mg/m2 daily x 5.  \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency (very common (\uf0b3 1/10); common \n\n(\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare \n\n(< 1/10,000)) in the table below. Adverse reactions reported during the post-marketing period are also \n\nincluded in the table under the frequency category \u201cnot known\u201d (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nPatients with advanced stages of ALL or AML may have confounding medical conditions that make \n\ncausality of adverse events difficult to assess due to the variety of symptoms related to the underlying \n\ndisease, its progression and the co-administration of numerous medicinal products. \n\n \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions considered to be related to clofarabine  \n\nreported at frequencies \u2265 1/1,000 (i.e. in > 1/115 patients) in clinical trials \n\nand post-marketing  \n\nInfections and infestations Common: Septic shock*, sepsis, bacteraemia, \n\npneumonia, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, oral \n\ncandidiasis \n\nFrequency not known: C. difficile colitis \n\nNeoplasms benign and malignant \n\n(including cysts and polyps) \n\nCommon: Tumour lysis syndrome* \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Very common: Febrile neutropaenia  \n\nCommon: Neutropaenia \n\nImmune system disorders Common: Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common: Anorexia, decreased appetite, dehydration \n\nFrequency not known: hyponatremia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very common: Anxiety \n\nCommon: Agitation, restlessness, mental status change \n\nNervous system disorders Very common: Headache \n\nCommon: Somnolence, peripheral neuropathy, \n\nparaesthesia, dizziness, tremor  \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Common: Hypoacusis \n\nCardiac disorders Common: Pericardial effusion*, tachycardia*  \n\nVascular disorders Very common: Flushing* \n\nCommon: Hypotension*, capillary leak syndrome, \n\nhaematoma \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon: Respiratory distress, epistaxis, dyspnoea, \n\ntachypnoea, cough  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea \n\nCommon: Mouth haemorrhage, gingival bleeding, \n\nhaematemesis, abdominal pain, stomatitis, upper \n\nabdominal pain, proctalgia, mouth ulceration  \n\nFrequency not known: Pancreatitis elevations in serum \n\namylase and lipase, enterocolitis, neutropaenic colitis, \n\ncaecitis \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n \n\nCommon: Hyperbilirubinaemia, jaundice, veno-\n\nocclusive disease,  increases in alanine (ALT)* and \n\naspartate (AST)* aminotransferases, hepatic failure \n\nUncommon: Hepatitis  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions  \n\nVery common: Fatigue, pyrexia, mucosal inflammation  \n\nCommon: Multi-organ failure, systemic inflammatory \n\nresponse syndrome*, pain, chills, irritability, oedema, \n\nperipheral oedema, feeling hot, feeling abnormal  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very common: Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia \n\nsyndrome, pruritus \n\nCommon: Maculo-papular rash, petechiae, erythema, \n\npruritic rash, skin exfoliation, generalised rash, alopecia, \n\nskin hyperpigmentation, generalised erythema,  \n\nerythematous rash, dry skin, hyperhidrosis  \n\nFrequency not known: Stevens Johnson Syndrome \n\n(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and \n\nbone disorders \n\nCommon: Pain in extremity, myalgia, bone pain, chest \n\nwall pain, arthralgia, neck and back pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common: Haematuria* \n\nCommon: Renal failure, acute renal failure \n\nInvestigations Common: Weight decreased  \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \n\ncomplications \n\nCommon: Contusion \n\n* = see below \n\n**All adverse reactions occurring at least twice (i.e., 2 or more reactions (1.7%)) are included in this \n\ntable \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nThe most frequent haematological laboratory abnormalities observed in patients treated with \n\nclofarabine were anaemia (83.3%; 95/114); leucopaenia (87.7%; 100/114); lymphopaenia (82.3%; \n\n93/113), neutropaenia (63.7%; 72/113), and thrombocytopaenia (80.7%; 92/114).The majority of \n\nthese events were of grade \uf0b3 3. \n\n \n\nDuring the post-marketing period prolonged cytopaenias (thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, neutropaenia \n\nand leukopaenia) and bone marrow failure have been reported. Bleeding events have been observed in \n\nthe setting of thrombocytopaenia. Haemorrhage, including cerebral, gastrointestinal and pulmonary \n\nhaemorrhage, has been reported and may be associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  \n\nSixty-four patients of 115 (55.7%) experienced at least one vascular disorders adverse event.  Twenty-\n\nthree patients out of 115 experienced a vascular disorder  considered to be related to clofarabine, the \n\nmost frequently reported being flushing (13 events; not serious) and hypotension (5 events; all of \n\nwhich were considered to be serious; see section 4.4).  However, the majority of these hypotensive \n\nevents were reported in patients who had confounding severe infections. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nFifty percent of patients experienced at least one cardiac disorders adverse event. Eleven events in \n\n115 patients were considered to be related to clofarabine, none of which were serious and the most \n\nfrequently reported cardiac disorder was tachycardia (35%) (see section 4.4); 6.1% (7/115) patient's \n\ntachycardia were considered to be related to clofarabine. Most of the cardiac adverse events were \n\nreported in the first 2 cycles. \n\n \n\nPericardial effusion and pericarditis were reported as an adverse event in 9% (10/115) of patients. \n\nThree of these events were subsequently assessed as being related to clofarabine: pericardial effusion \n\n(2 events; 1 of which was serious) and pericarditis (1 event; not serious). In the majority of patients \n\n(8/10), the pericardial effusion and pericarditis were deemed to be asymptomatic and of little or no \n\nclinical significance on echocardiographic assessment. However, the pericardial effusion was \n\nclinically significant in 2 patients with some associated haemodynamic compromise. \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations  \n\nForty-eight percent of patients had one or more ongoing infections prior to receiving treatment with \n\nclofarabine. A total of 83% of patients experienced at least 1 infection after clofarabine treatment, \n\nincluding fungal, viral and bacterial infections (see section 4.4). Twenty-one (18.3%) events were \n\nconsidered to be related to clofarabine of which catheter related infection (1 event), sepsis (2 events) \n\nand septic shock (2 events; 1 patient died (see above)) were considered to be serious. \n\n \n\nDuring the post-marketing period, bacterial, fungal and viral infections have been reported and may \n\nbe fatal. These infections may lead to septic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, and/or multi-\n\norgan failure. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  \n\nForty-one patients of 115 (35.7%) experienced at least one renal and urinary disorders adverse event.  \n\nThe most prevalent renal toxicity in paediatric patients was elevated creatinine. Grade 3 or 4 elevated \n\ncreatinine occurred in 8% of patients. Nephrotoxic medicinal products, tumour lysis, and tumour lysis \n\nwith hyperuricemia may contribute to renal toxicity (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Haematuria was \n\nobserved in 13% of patients overall. Four renal adverse events in 115 patients were considered to be \n\nrelated to clofarabine, none of which were serious; haematuria (3 events) and acute renal failure \n\n(1 event) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).   \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders  \n\nThe liver is a potential target organ for clofarabine toxicity and 25.2% of patients experienced at least \n\none hepato-biliary disorders adverse event (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Six events were considered to be \n\nrelated to clofarabine of which acute cholecystitis (1 event), cholelithiasis (1 event), hepatocellular \n\ndamage (1 event; patient died (see above)) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 event; the patient discontinued \n\ntherapy (see above)) were considered to be serious. Two paediatric reports (1.7%) of veno-occlusive \n\ndisease (VOD) were considered related to study drug.  \n\n \n\nVOD cases reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric and adult patients have been \n\nassociated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIn addition, 50/113 patients receiving clofarabine had at least severely (at least US NCI CTC Grade 3) \n\nelevated ALT, 36/100 elevated AST and 15/114 elevated bilirubin levels.  The majority of elevations \n\nin ALT and AST occurred within 10 days of clofarabine administration and returned to \uf0a3 grade 2 \n\nwithin 15 days. Where follow-up data are available, the majority of bilirubin elevations returned \n\nto \uf0a3 grade 2 within 10 days. \n\n \n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or capillary leak syndrome  \n\nSIRS, capillary leak syndrome (signs and symptoms of cytokine release, e.g., tachypnea, tachycardia, \n\nhypotension, pulmonary oedema) were reported as an adverse event in 5% (6/115) of paediatric \n\npatients (5 ALL, 1 AML) (see section 4.4). Thirteen events of tumour lysis syndrome, capillary leak \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nsyndrome or SIRS have been reported; SIRS (2 events; both were considered to be serious), capillary \n\nleak syndrome (4 events; 3 of which were considered serious and related) and tumour lysis syndrome \n\n(7 events; 6 of which were considered related and 3 of which were serious). \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome cases reported during the post-marketing period have been associated with a \n\nfatal outcome (See section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nOccurrences of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis, caecitis, and C. difficile colitis have been \n\nreported during treatment with clofarabine. Enterocolitis may lead to necrosis, perforation or sepsis \n\ncomplications and may be associated with fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders  \n\nStevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), including fatal cases, have \n\nbeen reported in patients who were receiving or had recently been treated with clofarabine. Other \n\nexfoliative conditions have also been reported. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. However, possible symptoms of overdose are expected to \n\ninclude nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and severe bone marrow suppression.  To date, the highest daily \n\ndose administered to human beings is 70 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days (2 paediatric ALL patients). \n\nThe toxicities observed in these patients included vomiting, hyperbilirubinaemia, elevated \n\ntransaminase levels and maculo-papular rash. \n\n \n\nManagement  \n\n \n\nNo specific antidotal therapy exists. Immediate discontinuation of therapy, careful observation and \n\ninitiation of appropriate supportive measures are recommended. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, ATC code: L01BB06.  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action  \n\n \n\nClofarabine is a purine nucleoside anti-metabolite. Its antitumour activity is believed to be due to \n\n3 mechanisms:  \n\n \n\n\u2022 DNA polymerase \uf061 inhibition resulting in termination of DNA chain elongation and/or DNA \n\nsynthesis / repair. \n\n\u2022 Ribonucleotide reductase inhibition with reduction of cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate \n\n(dNTP) pools. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n\u2022 Disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity with the release of cytochrome C and other \n\nproapoptotic factors leading to programmed cell death even in non-dividing lymphocytes. \n\n \n\nClofarabine must first diffuse or be transported into target cells where it is sequentially \n\nphosphorylated to the mono- and bi-phosphate by intracellular kinases, and then finally to the active \n\nconjugate, clofarabine 5\u2019-triphosphate. Clofarabine has high affinity for one of the activating \n\nphosphorylating enzymes, deoxycytidine kinase, which exceeds that of the natural substrate, \n\ndeoxycytidine. \n\n \n\nIn addition, clofarabine possesses greater resistance to cellular degradation by adenosine deaminase \n\nand decreased susceptibility to phosphorolytic cleavage than other active substances in its class whilst \n\nthe affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for DNA polymerase \uf061 and ribonucleotide reductase is similar \n\nto or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that clofarabine inhibits cell growth in and is cytotoxic to a variety \n\nof rapidly proliferating haematological and solid tumour cell lines.  It was also active against \n\nquiescent lymphocytes and macrophages.  In addition, clofarabine delayed tumour growth and, in \n\nsome cases, caused tumour regression in an assortment of human and murine tumour xenografts \n\nimplanted in mice. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy: To enable systematic evaluation of the responses seen in patients, an unblinded \n\nIndependent Response Review Panel (IRRP) determined the following response rates based on \n\ndefinitions produced by the Children\u2019s Oncology Group: \n\n \n\nCR = Complete Remission Patients who met each of the following criteria: \n\n\u2022 No evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary \n\ndisease \n\n\u2022 An M1 bone marrow (\u2264 5% blasts) \n\n\u2022 Recovery of peripheral counts (platelets \uf0b3 100 x 109/l \n\nand ANC \uf0b3 1.0 x 109/l) \n\nCRp = Complete Remission in the \n\nAbsence of Total Platelet Recovery \n\n\u2022 Patients who met all of the criteria for a CR except \n\nfor recovery of platelet counts to > 100 x 109/l \n\nPR = Partial Remission Patients who met each of the following criteria: \n\n\u2022 Complete disappearance of circulating blasts \n\n\u2022 An M2 bone marrow (\uf0b3 5% and \u2264 25% blasts) and \n\nappearance of normal progenitor cells \n\n\u2022 An M1 marrow that did not qualify for CR or CRp \n\nOverall Remission (OR) Rate - (Number of patients with a CR + Number of patients \n\nwith a CRp) \u00f7 Number of eligible patients who \n\nreceived clofarabine \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of clofarabine were evaluated in a phase I, open-label, non-comparative, \n\ndose-escalation study in 25 paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukaemia (17 ALL; \n\n8 AML) who had failed standard therapy or for whom no other therapy existed.  Dosing commenced \n\nat 11.25 with escalation to 15, 30, 40, 52 and 70 mg/m2/day by intravenous infusion for 5 days every \n\n2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response. Nine of 17 ALL patients were treated with \n\nclofarabine 52 mg/m2/day.  Of the 17 ALL patients, 2 achieved a complete remission (12%; CR) and 2 \n\na partial remission (12%; PR) at varying doses. Dose-limiting toxicities in this study were \n\nhyperbilirubinaemia, elevated transaminase levels and maculo-papular rash experienced at \n\n70 mg/m2/day (2 ALL patients; see section 4.9). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nA multi-centre, phase II, open-label, non-comparative study of clofarabine was conducted to \n\ndetermine the overall remission (OR) rate in heavily pretreated patients (\u2264 21 years old at initial \n\ndiagnosis) with relapsed or refractory ALL defined using the French-American-British classification. \n\nThe maximum tolerated dose identified in the phase I study described above of 52 mg/m2/day \n\nclofarabine was administered by intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 2 to 6 weeks. The \n\ntable below summarises the key efficacy results for this study. \n\n \n\nPatients with ALL must not have been eligible for therapy of higher curative potential and must have \n\nbeen in second or subsequent relapse and/or refractory i.e. failed to achieve remission after at least \n\ntwo prior regimens. Before enrolling in the trial, 58 of the 61 patients (95%) had received \n\n2 to 4 different induction regimens and 18/61 (30%) of these patients had undergone at least 1 prior \n\nhaematological stem cell transplant (HSCT). The median age of treated patients (37 males, \n\n24 females) was 12 years old. \n\n \n\nAdministration of clofarabine resulted in a dramatic and rapid reduction in peripheral leukaemia cells \n\nin 31 of the 33 patients (94%) who had a measurable absolute blast count at baseline. The 12 patients \n\nwho achieved an overall remission (CR + CRp) had a median survival time of 66.6 weeks as of the \n\ndata collection cut-off date. Responses were seen in different immunophenotypes of ALL, including \n\npre-B cell and T-cell. Although transplantation rate was not a study endpoint, 10/61 patients (16%) \n\nwent on to receive a HSCT after treatment with clofarabine (3 after achieving a CR, 2 after a CRp, \n\n3 after a PR, 1 patient that was considered a treatment failure by the IRRP and 1 that was considered \n\nnot evaluable by the IRRP). Response durations are confounded in patients who received a HSCT. \n\n \n\nEfficacy results from the pivotal study in patients (\u2264 21 years old at initial diagnosis) with \n\nrelapsed or refractory ALL after at least two prior regimens \n\nResponse \n\ncategory \n\nITT* \n\npatients \n\n(n = 61) \n\nMedian duration \n\nof remission \n\n(weeks) \n\n(95% CI) \n\nMedian time to \n\nprogression \n\n(weeks)** \n\n(95% CI) \n\nMedian overall \n\nsurvival (weeks) \n\n(95% CI) \n\nOverall \n\nremission \n\n(CR + CRp) \n\n12 \n\n(20%) \n\n32.0 \n\n(9.7 to 47.9) \n\n38.2 \n\n(15.4 to 56.1) \n\n69.5 \n\n(58.6 to -) \n\nCR 7 \n\n(12%) \n\n47.9 \n\n(6.1 to -) \n\n56.1 \n\n(13.7 to -) \n\n72.4 \n\n(66.6 to -) \n\nCRp 5 \n\n(8%) \n\n28.6 \n\n(4.6 to 38.3) \n\n37.0 \n\n(9.1 to 42) \n\n53.7 \n\n(9.1 to -) \n\nPR 6 \n\n(10%) \n\n11.0 \n\n(5.0 to -) \n\n14.4 \n\n(7.0 to -) \n\n33.0 \n\n(18.1 to -) \n\nCR + CRp + PR 18 \n\n(30%) \n\n21.5 \n\n(7.6 to 47.9) \n\n28.7 \n\n(13.7 to 56.1) \n\n66.6 \n\n(42.0 to -) \n\nTreatment \n\nfailure \n\n33 \n\n(54%) \n\nN/A  \n\n4.0 \n\n(3.4 to 5.1) \n\n \n\n7.6 \n\n(6.7 to 12.6) Not evaluable 10 \n\n(16%) \n\nN/A \n\nAll patients 61 \n\n(100%) \n\nN/A 5.4 \n\n(4.0 to 6.1) \n\n12.9 \n\n(7.9 to 18.1) \n\n*ITT = intention to treat. \n\n**Patients alive and in remission at the time of last follow up were censored at that time point for \n\nthe analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nIndividual duration remission and survival data for patients who achieved CR or CRp  \n\nBest Response \n\nTime to OR \n\n(weeks) \n\nDuration of \n\nRemission \n\n(weeks) \n\nOverall \n\nSurvival \n\n(weeks) \n\nPatients who did not undergo transplant \n\nCR 5.7 4.3 66.6 \n\nCR 14.3 6.1 58.6 \n\nCR 8.3 47.9 66.6 \n\nCRp 4.6 4.6 9.1 \n\nCR 3.3 58.6 72.4 \n\nCRp 3.7 11.7 53.7 \n\nPatients who underwent transplant while in continued \n\nremission* \n\nCRp 8.4 11.6+ 145.1+ \n\nCR 4.1 9.0+ 111.9+  \n\nCRp 3.7 5.6+ 42.0 \n\nCR 7.6 3.7+ 96.3+  \n\nPatients who underwent transplant after alternative therapy or \n\nrelapse* \n\nCRp 4.0 35.4 113.3+** \n\nCR 4.0 9.7 89.4*** \n\n* Duration of remission censored at the time of transplant \n\n** Patient received a transplant following alternate therapy \n\n*** Patient received a transplant following relapse \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019.

The patients were enrolled into a single phase I (n = 12) or two \n\nphase II (n = 14 / n = 14) safety and efficacy studies, and received multiple doses of clofarabine by \n\nintravenous infusion (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nPharmacokinetics in patients aged between 2 to 19 years old with relapsed or refractory \n\nALL or AML following administration of multiple doses of clofarabine by intravenous \n\ninfusion \n\nParameter Estimates based on \n\nnon-compartmental \n\nanalysis \n\n(n = 14 / n = 14) \n\nEstimates based on other \n\nanalysis \n\nDistribution: \n\nVolume of distribution (steady \n\nstate) \n\n172 l/m2  \n\nPlasma protein binding  47.1% \n\nSerum albumin  27.0% \n\nElimination: \n\n\uf062 half-life of clofarabine 5.2 hours  \n\nHalf-life of clofarabine \n\ntriphosphate \n\n > 24 hours \n\nSystemic clearance 28.8 l/h/m2  \n\nRenal clearance 10.8 l/h/m2  \n\nDose excreted in urine 57%  \n\n \n\nMultivariate analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine are weight dependent and \n\nalthough white blood cell (WBC) count was identified as having an impact on clofarabine \n\npharmacokinetics, this did not appear sufficient to individualise a patient\u2019s dosage regimen based on \n\ntheir WBC count.  Intravenous infusion of 52 mg/m2 clofarabine produced equivalent exposure across \n\na wide range of weights.  However, Cmax is inversely proportional to patient weight and, therefore, \n\nsmall children may have a higher Cmax at the end of infusion than a typical 40 kg child given the same \n\ndose of clofarabine per m2.  Accordingly, longer infusion times should be considered in children \n\nweighing \uf03c 20 kg (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\n \n\nClofarabine is eliminated by a combination of renal and non-renal excretion.  After 24 hours, about \n\n60% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Clofarabine clearance rates appear to be much \n\nhigher than glomerular filtration rates suggesting filtration and tubular secretion as kidney elimination \n\nmechanisms.  However, as clofarabine is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) \n\nenzyme system, pathways of non-renal elimination currently remain unknown. \n\n \n\nNo apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL or AML, or \n\nbetween males and females. \n\n \n\nNo relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and either efficacy or \n\ntoxicity has been established in this population. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nAdults (> 21 and < 65 years old)  \n\nThere are currently insufficient data to establish the safety and efficacy of clofarabine in adult \n\npatients.  However, the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine in adults with relapsed or refractory AML \n\nfollowing administration of a single dose of 40 mg/m2 clofarabine by intravenous infusion over 1 hour \n\nwere comparable to those described above in patients aged between 2 to 19 years old with relapsed or \n\nrefractory ALL or AML following administration of 52 mg/m2 clofarabine by intravenous infusion \n\nover 2 hours for 5 consecutive days. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)  \n\nThere are currently insufficient data to establish the safety and efficacy of clofarabine in patients \n\n65 years of age or older. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nTo date, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine in paediatric patients with \n\ndecreased creatinine clearance.  However, these data indicate that clofarabine may accumulate in such \n\npatients (see figure below).   \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic data from adult and paediatric patients suggest that patients with stable \n\nmoderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 < 60 ml/min) receiving a 50% dose reduction \n\nachieve similar clofarabine exposure to those with normal renal function receiving a standard dose.  \n\n \n\nClofarabine AUC0-24 hours by baseline estimated creatinine clearance in patients aged between \n\n2 to 19 years old with relapsed or refractory ALL or AML (n = 11 / n = 12) following \n\nadministration of multiple doses of clofarabine by intravenous infusion \n\n(creatinine clearance estimated using Schwartz formula) \n\nEstimated creatinine clearance (ml/min)\n\nClofarabine\n\nAUC 0-24 hours\n\n(ng*h/ml)\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n \n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nThere is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN plus AST \n\nand ALT > 5 x ULN) and the liver is a potential target organ for toxicity (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nToxicology studies of clofarabine in mice, rats and dogs showed that rapidly proliferating tissues were \n\nthe primary target organs of toxicity. \n\n \n\nCardiac effects were observed in rats consistent with cardiomyopathy and contributed to signs of \n\ncardiac failure after repeated cycles of treatment. The incidence of these toxicities was dependent on \n\nboth the dose of clofarabine administered and the duration of treatment. They were reported at \n\nexposure levels (Cmax) approximately 7 to 13 fold (after 3 or more dosing cycles) or 16 to 35 fold \n\n(after one or more dosing cycles) higher than clinical exposures. The minimal effects seen at lower \n\ndoses suggest that there is a threshold for toxicities on the heart and nonlinear plasma \n\npharmacokinetics in the rat may play a role in the observed effects. The potential risk for humans is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nGlomerulonephropathy was reported in rats at exposure levels 3 to 5 fold higher than the clinical \n\nAUC after 6 dosing cycles of clofarabine. It was characterised by minor thickening of the glomerular \n\nbasement membrane with only slight tubular damage and was not associated with changes in serum \n\nchemistry. \n\n \n\nHepatic effects were observed in rats following chronic administration of clofarabine. These likely \n\nrepresent the superimposition of degenerative and regenerative changes as a result of treatment cycles, \n\nand were not associated with changes in serum chemistry. Histological evidence of hepatic effects \n\nwas seen in dogs following acute administration of high doses, but was also not accompanied by \n\nchanges in serum chemistry. \n\n \n\nDose related toxicities on male reproductive organs were observed in mice, rats and dogs. These \n\neffects included bilateral degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium with retained spermatids and \n\natrophy of interstitial cells in rats at exaggerated exposure levels (150 mg/m2/day), and cell \n\ndegeneration of the epididymis and degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in dogs at clinically \n\nrelevant exposure levels (> 7.5 mg/m2/day clofarabine). \n\n \n\nDelayed ovarian atrophy or degeneration and uterine mucosal apoptosis were observed in female mice \n\nat the only dose used of 225 mg/m2/day clofarabine. \n\n \n\nClofarabine was teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Increases in postimplantation loss, reduced foetal \n\nbody weights and decreased litter sizes together with increases in the number of malformations (gross \n\nexternal, soft tissue) and skeletal alterations (including retarded ossification) were reported in rats \n\nreceiving doses which produced approximately 2 to 3 fold the clinical exposure (54 mg/m2/day) and in \n\nrabbits receiving 12 mg/m2/day clofarabine. (There are no exposure data in rabbits.) The threshold for \n\ndevelopmental toxicity was considered to be 6 mg/m2/day in rats and 1.2 mg/m2/day in rabbits. The \n\nno-observable effect level for maternal toxicity in rats was 18 mg/m2/day and in rabbits was more than \n\n12 mg/m2/day. No fertility studies have been conducted. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies demonstrated that clofarabine was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse \n\nmutation assay, but did induce clastogenic effects in the non-activated chromosomal aberration assay \n\nin Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

(If the use of a 0.2 micrometre syringe filter is not feasible, the concentrate \n\nshould be pre-filtered with a 5 micrometre filter, diluted and then administered through a \n\n0.22 micrometre in-line filter.) \n\n \n\nSuggested dilution schedule based on the recommended dosage of 52 mg/m2/day clofarabine \n\nBody surface area (m2) Concentrate (ml)* Total diluted volume \n\n\u2264 1.44 \u2264 74.9 100 ml \n\n1.45 to 2.40 75.4 to 124.8 150 ml \n\n2.41 to 2.50 125.3 to 130.0 200 ml \n\n*Each ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of clofarabine.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

What you need to know before you use Evoltra \n\n3. How to use Evoltra \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Evoltra \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Evoltra is and what it is used for \n \n\nEvoltra contains the active substance clofarabine. Clofarabine is one of a family of medicines called \n\nanticancer medicines. It works by hindering the growth of abnormal white blood cells, and eventually \n\nkills them. It works best against cells which are multiplying quickly \u2013 such as cancer cells. \n\n \n\nEvoltra is used to treat children (\u2265 1 year old), teenagers and young adults up to 21 years old with \n\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when previous treatments have not worked or have stopped \n\nworking. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by abnormal growth of some types of white blood \n\ncells. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Evoltra \n \n\nDo not use Evoltra: \n\n- if you are allergic to clofarabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6); \n\n- if you are breast-feeding (please read the section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d below); \n\n- if you have severe kidney or liver problems. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you.  If you are the parent of a child who is \n\nbeing treated with Evoltra, tell the doctor if any of them apply to your child. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  Evoltra may not be suitable for you: \n\n- if you have suffered a severe reaction after previously using this medicine; \n\n- if you have kidney disease, or used to have it; \n\n- if you have liver disease, or used to have it; \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n- if you have heart disease, or used to have it. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or carer immediately if you experience any of the following as you may need to \n\nstop treatment: \n\n- if you get a fever or high temperature \u2013 because clofarabine reduces the number of blood cells \n\nmade in the bone marrow, you may be more likely to catch infections; \n\n- if you have breathing difficulties, rapid breathing, or breathlessness; \n\n- if you feel a change in your heart rate; \n\n- if you suffer from dizziness (light-headedness) or fainting \u2013 it may be a symptom of low blood \n\npressure; \n\n- if you feel sick or have diarrhoea (loose bowels); \n\n- if your urine is darker than usual \u2013 it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration; \n\n- if you get a rash with blisters or mouth ulcers;  \n\n- if you lose your appetite, have nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhea, dark-colored urine and \n\nlight-coloured stools, stomach pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), or if you feel \n\ngenerally unwell, these could be symptoms of an inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), or liver \n\ndamage (hepatic failure); \n\n- if you pass little or no urine, or experience drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, loss of \n\nappetite and / or weakness (these may be signs of acute kidney failure / kidney failure).  \n\n \n\n If you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Evoltra, tell the doctor if any of the \n\nabove conditions apply to your child. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Evoltra, your doctor will carry out regular blood tests and other tests to \n\nmonitor your health.  Because of the way this medicine works, it will affect your blood and other \n\norgans. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor about contraception.  Young men and women must use effective contraception \n\nduring and after treatment.  See the section \u2018Pregnancy and breast-feeding\u2019 below.  Evoltra may harm \n\nboth male and female reproductive organs.  Ask your doctor to explain what can be done to protect \n\nyou or allow you to have a family. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Evoltra \n\nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used: \n\n- medicines for heart disease; \n\n- any medicine that changes your blood pressure; \n\n- medicines that affect your liver or kidneys; \n\n- any other medicines including those obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nClofarabine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\nWomen who are able to get pregnant: you must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\nclofarabine.  Clofarabine may cause harm to unborn babies when used by pregnant women.  If you are \n\npregnant or you become pregnant during treatment with clofarabine, get medical advice \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nMen must also use effective contraception while they or their partner are treated with clofarabine. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, you must stop breast-feeding before starting the treatment, and must not \n\nbreast-feed during your treatment and within 3 months after completion of your treatment. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy, light-headed or faint. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nEvoltra contains salt \n\nEach vial contains 180 mg of salt (sodium chloride). This is equivalent to 3.08 mmol (or 70.77 mg) of \n\nsodium. You need to allow for this if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Evoltra \n \n\nYour treatment with Evoltra has been prescribed by a qualified doctor experienced in treating \n\nleukaemia. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will work out the dose that is right for you depending on your height, weight and how \n\nwell you are. Before Evoltra is given to you, it will be diluted in a sodium chloride solution (salt and \n\nwater). Tell your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet as it could affect how you will be given \n\nyour medicine. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will give you Evoltra once every day for 5 days. It will be given to you as an infusion \n\nthrough a long thin tube which goes into a vein (a drip), or into a small medical appliance that is \n\ninserted under the skin (port-a-cath) if you (or your child) have one implanted. The infusion will be \n\ngiven over 2 hours. If you (or your child) weigh less than 20 kg, the infusion time may be longer. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will monitor your health and may change your dose depending on your response to the \n\ntreatment. It is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Evoltra than you should \n\nIf you think you may have been given too much medicine, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Evoltra \n\nYour doctor will tell you when you need to be given this medicine. If you think that you have missed \n\na dose, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

medicine. your doctor will give you evoltra once every day for 5 days. it will be given to you as an infusion through a long thin tube which goes into a vein (a drip), or into a small medical appliance that is inserted under the skin (port-a-cath) if you (or your child) have one implanted. the infusion will be given over 2 hours. if you (or your child) weigh less than 20 kg, the infusion time may be longer. your doctor will monitor your health and may change your dose depending on your response to the treatment. it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. if you use more evoltra than you should if you think you may have been given too much medicine, tell your doctor straight away. if you forget to use evoltra your doctor will tell you when you need to be given
