Dose titration should be continued until efficacy is balanced with undesirable effects and \namended up or down as appropriate, to a maximum individual dose of 64 micrograms/kg body weight \nglycopyrronium or 6 ml (1.9 mg glycopyrronium, equivalent to 2.4 mg glycopyrronium bromide) three \ntimes a day, whichever is less. Dose titrations should be conducted in discussion with the carer to \nassess both efficacy and undesirable effects until an acceptable maintenance dose is achieved.  \n \nUndesirable effects may be minimised by using the lowest effective dose necessary to control \nsymptoms. It is important that the carer checks the dose volume in the syringe before administration. \nThe maximum volume of the highest dose is 6ml. In the event of a known anticholinergic adverse \nevent occurring when the dose is increased, the dose should be reduced to the previous lower dose and \nthe event monitored. If the event does not resolve treatment should be discontinued. In the event of \nconstipation, urinary retention or pneumonia treatment should be stopped and the prescribing \nphysician contacted. \nYounger children may be more susceptible to adverse events and this should be borne in mind when \nany dose adjustments are carried out. \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n \nFollowing the dose titration period, the child’s sialorrhoea should be monitored, in conjunction with \nthe carer at no longer than 3 monthly intervals, to assess changes in efficacy and/or tolerability over \ntime, and the dose adjusted accordingly. \n\n \nThe Table 1 shows the dose in ml of solution to be given for each weight range at each dosing \nincrease. \n \n \nTable 1.

There is limited clinical trial evidence on the \nuse of glycopyrronium in the adult population with pathological drooling.  \n \nElderly population \nSialanar is indicated for the paediatric population only. The elderly have a longer elimination half-life \nand reduced medicinal product clearance as well as limited data to support efficacy in short-term use. \nAs such Sialanar should not be used in patients over the age of 65 years. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nClinical studies have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is \ncleared predominantly from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and hepatic impairment is not \nthought to result in a clinically relevant increase in systemic exposure of glycopyrronium. \n \nRenal impairment \nSevere renal impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nMild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR <90 - ≥30 ml/min/1.73m2) doses should be reduced by 30% \n(see Table 2). \n \n \nTable 2.

High fat food should be avoided. Where the child’s specific needs determine \nthat co-administration with food is required, dosing of the medicinal product should be consistently \nperformed during food intake.  \n \nNasogastric / feeding tubes, if used, should be flushed with 10 ml water immediately after dosing. \n \nSee section 6.6 for instructions for use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \nGlaucoma.   \n \nUrinary retention.  \n \nSevere renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2), including those with end-stage renal disease \nrequiring dialysis. \n \nHistory of intestinal obstruction, ulcerative colitis, paralytic ileus, pyloric stenosis and myasthenia \ngravis. \n \nConcomitant treatment with (see section 4.5);  \n\npotassium chloride solid oral dose;  \nanticholinergics; \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAnticholinergic effects \n\nAnticholinergic effects such as urinary retention, constipation and overheating due to inhibition of \nsweating may be dose dependent and difficult to assess in a disabled child. Monitoring by physicians \nand caregivers is required with adherence to the management instructions below: \n\n \nManagement of important anticholinergic side effects \nThe carer should stop treatment and seek advice from the prescriber in the event of: \n• constipation \n• urinary retention  \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n• pneumonia \n• allergic reaction \n• pyrexia \n• very hot weather \n• changes in behaviour \n \nAfter evaluating the event, the prescriber will decide if treatment should remain stopped or if this \nshould continue at a lower dose. \n \nLack of long-term safety data \nPublished safety data are not available beyond 24 weeks treatment duration. Given the limited long-\nterm safety data available and the uncertainties around the potential risk for carcinogenicity, total \ntreatment duration should be kept as short as possible. If continuous treatment is needed (eg in a \npalliative setting) or the treatment is repeated intermittently (e.g. in the non palliative setting treating \nchronic disease) benefits and risks should be carefully considered on a case by case basis and \ntreatment should be closely monitored. \n \nMild to moderate sialorrhoea \nDue to the low likelihood of benefit and the known adverse effect profile, Sialanar should not be given \nto children with mild to moderate sialorrhoea.  \n \nCardiac disorders \nGlycopyrronium should be used with caution in patients with acute myocardial infarction, \nhypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias and conditions characterised by tachycardia \n(including thyrotoxicosis, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac surgery) due to the potential increase in heart \nrate, blood pressure and rhythm disorders produced by its administration. The carer should be advised \nto measure the pulse rate if the child seems unwell and report very fast or very slow heart rate. \n \nGastro-intestinal disorders \nAntimuscarinics such as glycopyrronium should be used with caution in patients with gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease, pre-existing constipation and diarrhoea.  \n \nDental \nSince reduced salivation can increase the risk of oral cavities and periodontal diseases, it is important \nthat patients receive adequate daily dental hygiene and regular dental health checks. \n \nRespiratory  \nGlycopyrronium can cause thickening of secretions, which may increase the risk of respiratory \ninfection and pneumonia. Glycopyrronium should be discontinued if pneumonia is present. \n \nCNS adverse events \nIncreased central nervous system effects have been reported in clinical trials including: irritability; \ndrowsiness; restlessness; overactivity; short attention span; frustration; mood changes; temper \noutbursts or explosive behaviour; excessive sensitivity; seriousness or sadness; frequent crying \nepisodes; fearfulness. Behavioural changes should be monitored. \nAs a consequence of its quaternary charge glycopyrronium has limited ability to penetrate the blood \nbrain barrier, although the extent of penetration is unknown. Caution should be exercised in children \nwith compromised blood brain barrier eg. Intraventicular shunt, brain tumour, encephalitis. \n \nChildren below the age of 3 years \nSialanar is not recommended in children below the age of 3 years since there is very limited data on \nthe efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium in this age group. \n \nGrowth and development \nThe effects of glycopyrronium on the reproductive system have not been investigated.  \nWhilst clinical studies do not report any short or long-term effect of glycopyrronium on \nneurodevelopment or growth, no studies have been conducted to specifically address these issues.  \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n \nSodium  \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium free’. \n \nSodium benzoate \nThis medicinal product contains 2.3 mg sodium benzoate (E211) in each ml. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere are limited data available relating to interactions with other medicinal products in the paediatric \nage group.  \nThe following medicinal product interaction information is relevant to glycopyrronium. \n \nContraindications of concomitant use \nConcomitant use of the following medicinal products is contraindicated (see section 4.3): \n \nPotassium chloride solid oral dose: glycopyrronium may potentiate the risk of upper gastrointestinal \ninjury associated with oral solid formulations of potassium chloride due to increased gastrointestinal \ntransit time creating a high localized concentration of potassium ions. An association with upper GI \nbleeding and small bowel ulceration, stenosis, perforation, and obstruction has been observed.  \n \nAnticholinergics: concomitant use of anticholinergics may increase the risk of anticholinergic side \neffects. Anticholinergics may delay the gastrointestinal absorption of other anticholinergics \nadministered orally and also increase the risk of anticholinergic side effects. \n \nConcomitant use to be considered with caution \nConcomitant use of the following medicinal products should be considered with caution: \n\n \nAntispasmodics: glycopyrronium may antagonize the pharmacologic effects of gastrointestinal \nprokinetic active substances such as domperidone and metoclopramide.  \n \nTopiramate: glycopyrronium may potentiate the effects of oligohidrosis and hyperthermia associated \nwith the use of topiramate, particularly in pediatric patients; \n \nSedating antihistamines: may have additive anticholinergic effects. A reduction in anticholinergic \nand/or antihistamine dosage may be necessary; \n \nNeuroleptics/antipsychotics: the effects of active substances such as phenothiazines, clozapine and \nhaloperidol may be potentiated. A reduction in anticholinergic and/or neuroleptic/antipsychotic dose \nmay be necessary; \n \nSkeletal muscle relaxants: Use of anticholinergics after administration of botulinum toxin may \npotentiate systemic anticholinergic effects; \n \nTricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs: may have additive anticholinergic effects. A reduction in \nanticholinergic and/or tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs dosage may be necessary. \n \nOpioids: active substances such as pethidine and codeine may result in additive central nervous system \nand gastrointestinal adverse effects, and increase the risk of severe constipation or paralytic ileus and \nCNS depression. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored for potentially \nexcessive or prolonged CNS depression and constipation; \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nCorticosteroids: Steroid-induced glaucoma may develop with topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous, \nsteroid administration. Concomitant use may result in increased intraocular pressure via an open- or a \nclosed-angle mechanism;  \n \nOther  \nMedicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e.g. antihistamines, antidepressants) may cause \ncumulative parasympatholytic effects including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation and \nconfusion, and an increased risk of anticholinergic intoxication syndrome.  \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nEffective contraception should be considered prior to treating women of childbearing age, where \nappropriate. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of Sialanar in pregnant women. The assessment of reproductive endpoints \nfor glycopyrronium is limited (see section 5.3). Glycopyrronium is contraindicated in pregnancy (see \nsection 4.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety in breast-feeding has not been established. Use while breast-feeding is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of Sialanar on male or female fertility. Reproductive performance in \nrats given glycopyrronium shows a decrease in the rate of conception and in survival rate at weaning. \nThere are insufficient data in the public domain to adequately assess effects on the reproductive \nsystem in young adults (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSialanar has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The anticholinergic effects \nof glycopyrronium may cause blurred vision, dizziness and other effects that may impair a patient's \nability to perform skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle and using machines. The undesirable \neffects are increased with increasing dose. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAdverse reactions are common with glycopyrronium due to its known pharmacodynamic \nanticholinergic effects. The efficacy of the medicinal product should be balanced against the adverse \nreactions and the dose monitored regularly and adjusted as necessary.  The most common \nanticholinergic adverse reactions in the placebo-controlled studies (see section 5.1) related to the \ngastrointestinal system and were dry mouth, constipation, diarrhoea and vomiting, all of which \noccurred at a rate of ≥15%.  The safety profile is further characterised by other symptoms, related to \nthe anticholinergic effects at a rate of ≥15%, including urinary retention, flushing and nasal \ncongestion.  \nAdverse reactions are more common with higher doses and prolonged use. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported in the literature for trials using glycopyrronium for sialorrhoea in the \npaediatric population (including 2 placebo controlled trials, an uncontrolled safety study using \nglycopyrronium for a 6 month period, and 3 supportive studies with adverse event data in the target \npopulation) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (Table 3). Within each system organ class, the \nadverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Glycopyrronium treatment should be withdrawn until the urinary retention resolves. \n \nPneumonia \nPneumonia is a known adverse reaction associated with anticholinergic medicinal products (7.9%). \nGlycopyrronium treatment should be withdrawn until the pneumonia resolves.  \n \nConstipation \nConstipation is a known adverse reaction associated with anticholinergic medicinal products (30%). \nGlycopyrronium treatment should be withdrawn until the constipation resolves. \n \nCentral Nervous System \nAlthough glycopyrronium has limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier, increased central nervous \nsystem effects have been reported in clinical trials (23%). Such effects should be discussed with the \ncarer during treatment reviews and a dose reduction considered.  \n \nCardiac disorders \nGlycopyrronium is known to have an effect on heart rate and blood pressure at doses used during \nanaesthesia although clinical trials in children with chronic drooling have not shown this effect. An \neffect on the cardiovascular system should be considered when assessing tolerability. \n \nHaematology and chemistry \nA decrease of >10% from the normal reference range at baseline for absolute neutrophil (11.2%) and \nred blood cell (11.1%) count, and increases >10% from the normal reference range at baseline for \nmonocyte (16.7%) and absolute monocyte (11.2%) counts has been seen.  Decreases >10% from the \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nnormal reference range at baseline were observed for carbon dioxide (15.1%), bicarbonate (13.3%), \nand creatinine (10.7%) concentrations. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nOverdose of glycopyrronium can result in anticholinergic syndrome, produced by the inhibition of \ncholinergic neurotransmission at muscarinic receptor sites. Clinical manifestations are caused by CNS \neffects, peripheral nervous system effects, or both. Common manifestations include flushing, dry skin \nand mucous membranes, mydriasis with loss of accommodation, altered mental status and fever. \nAdditional manifestations include sinus tachycardia, decreased bowel sounds, functional ileus, urinary \nretention, hypertension, tremulousness and myoclonic jerking.  \n \nManagement \nPatients presenting with anticholinergic toxicity should be transported to the nearest emergency \nfacility with advanced life support capabilities. Pre-hospital gastrointestinal decontamination with \nactivated charcoal is not recommended because of the potential for somnolence and seizures and the \nresulting risk of pulmonary aspiration. At hospital, activated charcoal can be administered if the \npatient’s airways can be adequately protected.  Physostigmine salicylate is recommended when \ntachydysrhythmia with subsequent hemodynamic compromise, intractable seizure, severe agitation or \npsychosis is present.  \n \nPatients and/or parents/caregivers should be counselled to ensure an acurate dose is given each time, in \norder to prevent the harmful consequences of anticholinergic reactions of glycopyrronium seen with \ndosing errors or overdose.   \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for functional gastrointestinal disorders, synthetic \nanticholinergics, quaternary ammonium compounds. ATC Code: A03AB02.  \n \nGlycopyrronium is a quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic with peripheral effects similar to those of \natropine.  \n \nAntimuscarinics are competitive inhibitors of the actions of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors \nof autonomic effector sites innervated by parasympathetic (cholinergic postganglionic) nerves. They \nalso inhibit the action of acetylcholine where smooth muscle lacks cholinergic innervation. \n \nSalivation is primarily mediated by parasympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. \nGlycopyrronium competitively inhibits cholinergic muscarinic receptors in salivary glands and other \nperipheral tissues, thus indirectly reducing the rate of salivation. Glycopyrronium has little effect on \ncholinergic stimuli at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on structures innervated by postganglionic \ncholinergic neurons, and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but have no cholinergic \ninnervation. \n \nPeripheral antimuscarinic effects that are produced as the dose increases are: decreased production of \nsecretions from the salivary, bronchial and sweat glands; dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) and \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nparalysis of accommodation (cyclopegia); increased heart rate; inhibition of micturition and reduction \nin gastrointestinal tone; inhibition of gastric acid secretion. \n \nPlacebo controlled efficacy data includes patients with a treatment duration of 8 weeks. There is no \nplacebo or comparator controlled data beyond 8 weeks. \n \nZeller et al 2012a evaluated the efficacy of glycopyrronium bromide oral solution (1 mg/5 mL) in \nmanaging problem drooling associated with cerebral palsy and other neurologic conditions.  Thirty-\neight patients aged 3–23 years weighing at least 27 lb (12.2 kg) with severe drooling (clothing damp \n5–7 days/week) were randomized to eight-weeks treatment with glycopyrronium (n = 20), \n20-100 μg/kg (not exceeding 3 mg in total) three times a day, or matching placebo (n = 18). The first \nfour weeks were an individual titration period in fixed steps depending on response followed by \n4-weeks maintenance treatment. Primary efficacy endpoint was responder rate, defined as percentage \nshowing ≥3-point improvement on the modified Teacher’s Drooling Scale (mTDS). The primary \nanalysis population was revised to only comprise patients with an age of 3 -16 years which rendered \n19 patients in the glycopyrrolate oral solution group an 17 in the placebo group. Responder rate was \ndefined as at least a 3-point improvement in modified Teacher’s Drooling Scale (mTDS). \n\n \n\nResponder rate at week 8 At least a 3-point improvement in \nmTDS \n\nMean improvements in mTDS \n\nGlycopyrronium 14 of 19 patients (73.7%) 3.94 points  \n(SD: 1.95; 95%; CI: 2.97–4.91) \n\nPlacebo 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) 0.71 points  \n(SD: 2.14; 95% CI: –0.43–1.84) \n\np value p = 0.0011 p <0.0001 \n \n \nIn addition, 84% of physicians and 100% of parents/caregivers regarded glycopyrrolate as worthwhile \ncompared with 41% and 56%, respectively, for placebo (p≤0.014). Most frequently reported \ntreatment-emergent adverse events (glycopyrrolate vs placebo) were dry mouth, constipation, \nvomiting and nasal congestion. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of glycopyrronium have been studied in an open labelled study with no control \ngroup over a 24-week period in children aged 3 to 18 years. At the week 24/exit visit, 52.3% (95% \nconfidence interval 43.7–60.9) of patients (n=130) had an at least three-point decrease in mTDS from \nbaseline and were classified as responders to treatment with oral glycopyrrolate solution..  The adverse \nevent profile was consistent with the one seen with anticholinergics (see section 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nMean absolute oral bioavailability of glycopyrronium comparing a single 50 µg/kg oral dose and a \nsingle 5 µg/kg i.v. dose was low at approximately 3% (range 1.3–13.3%) in children aged 7–14 years \nundergoing intraocular surgery (n = 6) due to the medicinal product’s low lipid solubility. Data from \nsparse PK sampling in children suggests dose proportional PK.  \n \nThe bioavailability of oral glycopyrronium in children was between that of adults under fed and fasted \nconditions. Co-administration with food results in a marked decrease in systemic glycopyrronium \nexposure. \n \nIn adults, distribution of glycopyrronium was rapid following a single 6 µg/kg i.v. dose; distribution \nhalf-life was 2.2 ± 1.3 minutes.  Following administration of 3H-labelled glycopyrronium more than \n90% of the radiolabel disappeared from the plasma in 5 minutes, and almost 100% within 30 minutes, \nreflecting rapid distribution. Analyses of population pharmacokinetic data from healthy adults and \nchildren with cerebral palsy-associated chronic moderate to severe drooling who received \nglycopyrronium (route of administration and dosages not specified) did not demonstrate linear \npharmacokinetics of the medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nThe volume of distribution, 0.64 ± 0.29 L/kg in adults is similar to that of total body water. Volume of \ndistribution is somewhat higher in the paediatric population(s), in the range 1.31 to 1.83 L/kg. \n \nThe PK of glycopyrronium has been shown to be essentially independent of age in children in the age \nrange 0.19 – 14 years administered a 5 µg/kg i.v. single-dose. In most paediatric subjects, plasma \nglycopyrronium vs. time plots are reported to show a triexponential curve; adults generally show a \nbiexponential curve.  Modest changes in volume of distribution (Vss) and clearance (Cl) have been \nobserved in children between 1 and 3 years of age, leading to a statistically significant shorter \nelimination half-life (t½, z) than that observed in younger (<1 year of age; p = 0.037) or older (>3 years \nof age; p = 0.042) groups.  \n \nIn a study in healthy adults, a 2000 µg single dose of  glycopyrronium bromide resulted in an AUC of \n2.39 µg.h/L (fasted). An AUC0-6 h of 8.64 µg.h/L was observed after 6 µg/kg i.v. glycopyrronium. \n \nBased upon theoretical physicochemical considerations, the quaternary ammonium compound \nglycopyrronium would be expected to have low central bioavailability; no glycopyrronium was \ndetectable in the CSF of anaesthetised surgical patients or patients undergoing caesarean section \nfollowing a 6 – 8 µg/kg i.v. dose.  In the paediatric population 5 µg/kg i.v. glycopyrronium has low \ncentral bioavailability, except in the case where the blood brain barrier has been compromised (e.g. a \nshunt infection). \n \nThe primary route of elimination of glycopyrronium is via renal excretion, mainly as unchanged \nmedicinal product.  Approximately 65% of an i.v. dose is renally excreted within the first 24 hours. A \nsmall proportion (~5%) is eliminated in the bile.   \n \nThe elimination half-life of glycopyrronium appears to be dependent on route of administration being \n0.83 ± 0.27 hours after i.v. administration, 75 minutes after i.m. administration and in the region of \n2.5 - 4 h after oral (solution) administration, though again this was highly variable. That the latter two \nhalf-lives, and especially that for oral administration, are longer than for i.v. administration probably \nreflects the complex absorption and distribution of glycopyrronium by each route.  It is possible that \nprolonged absorption after oral administration translates into elimination being faster than absorption \n(known as flip-flop kinetics, characterized by Ka < Ke). \n \nThe total body clearance of the medicinal product following an i.v. dose is relatively high at between \n0.54 ± 0.14 L/h/kg and 1.14 ± 0.31 L/h/kg.  As this exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and it \nappears that more than 50% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, it is probable that the renal \nelimination of glycopyrronium involves both glomerular filtration and proximal tubular secretion by \nthe base secretory mechanism.   \n \nA mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4 fold was seen in adult subjects with \nmild and moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30mL/min/1.73m2) and up to 2.2 fold in subjects with \nsevere renal impairment or end stage renal disease (estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2). A 30% dose \nreduction (see Table 2) is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \nGlycopyrronium is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nBaseline characteristics (age, weight, gender and race) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of \nglycopyrronium. \n \nImpaired hepatic function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium since the \nmajority of the medicinal product is eliminated through the kidneys. \n \nCo-administration with food results in a marked decrease in systemic glycopyrronium exposure (see \nsection 4.2.).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data, including genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have not been performed for \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nSialanar. \nLimited non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeated dose toxicity.  \n \nThe single dose toxicity of glycopyrronium has been tested in a range of investigations, although only \nlimited experimental details are available. Upon oral administration, high LD50 values of 550 mg/kg in \nmice and above 1,000 mg/kg in rats were reported.  In rats at higher doses (1500-2000 mg/kg) tremors, \nclonic and tonic convulsions and laboured breathing were observed prior to death, resulting from \nrespiratory failure.  \n \nChronic oral administration of glycopyrronium at doses of 4, 16 and 64 mg/kg for up to 27 weeks in \ndogs produced mydriasis, cycloplegia, xerostomia, emesis, occasional lacrimation, injection of sclera \nand rhinorrhoea.  \n\nExtrapolation of safety margins to the paediatric population is not possible, as no exposure data are \navailable from repeated dose toxicology studies and no studies in juvenile animals have been \nperformed with glycopyrronium. \n\n \nData on reproductive endpoints for glycopyrronium are very limited. A reduction in corpora lutea was \nobserved in female rats administered glycopyrronium. No effects on fertility were observed in male \nrats. Reproductive performance in rats given glycopyrronium shows a decrease in the rate of \nconception and in survival rate at weaning. The significance of the non-clinical findings for humans is \nnot clear, and the lack of human data on the medicinal product leads to glycopyrronium being \ncontraindicated in pregnant women.There are insufficient data in the public domain to adequately \nassess effects on the reproductive system in young adults, and safety in human pregnancy has not been \nestablished.  \n\n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSodium benzoate (E211) \nRaspberry flavouring (containing propylene glycol E1520) \nSucralose (E955) \nCitric acid (E330) \nPurified water \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts.  \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n2 years.  \n \n2 months after first opening. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25°C. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nAmber coloured glass bottle with a high density polyethylene tamper evident child resistant closure \nwith expanded low density polyethylene liner.

What Sialanar is and what it is used for \n \nSialanar is a medicine that contains the active substance glycopyrronium.  \nGlycopyrronium belongs to a group of medicines known as quaternary ammonium anticholinergics, \nwhich are agents that block or reduce the transmission between nerve cells. This reduced transmission \ncan de-activate the cells that produce saliva. \n\n \nSialanar is used to treat excessive production of saliva (sialorrhoea) in children and adolescents aged \n3 years and older.  \n \nSialorrhoea (drooling or excessive salivation) is a common symptom of many diseases of the nerves \nand muscles. It is mostly caused by poor control of muscles in the face. Acute sialorrhoea may be \nassociated with inflammation, dental infections or infections of the mouth. \n \nSialanar acts on the salivary glands to reduce production of saliva.  \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you give Sialanar \n \nDo not give Sialanar if the child or adolescent: \n\n− is allergic to glycopyrronium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6)  \n\n− is pregnant or breast feeding \n− has glaucoma (raised pressure in the eye) \n− is unable to completely empty the bladder (urinary retention) \n− has severe kidney disease \n− has an obstruction of the stomach (pyloric stenosis) or bowel causing vomiting  \n− has diarrhoea (frequent, loose watery stools) \n− has ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the intestine) \n− stomach ache and swelling (paralytic ileus) \n− has myasthenia gravis (muscle weakness and tiredness) \n− is taking any of the following medicines (see section Other medicines and Sialanar):  \n\n\n\n 28 \n\npotassium chloride solid oral dose;  \nanticholinergic medicines.   \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Sialanar if your child has: \n\n• heart disease, heart failure, irregular heartbeats or high blood pressure   \n• digestive disorders (constipation; chronic heartburn and indigestion) \n• a high temperature (fever) \n• inability to sweat normally \n• kidney problems or difficulty passing urine \n• abnormal blood brain barrier (the layer of cells surrounding the brain) \n\n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to your child, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before \ngiving Sialanar. \n \nAvoid exposing the child to hot or very warm temperature (hot weather, high room temperature) to \navoid over heating and the possibility of heat stroke. Check with the child’s doctor during hot weather \nto see if the dose of Sialanar should be reduced. \n \nReduced salivation can increase the risk of dental disease therefore the child’s teeth should be brushed \ndaily and they should have regular dental health checks. \n \nChildren with kidney problems may be given a lower dose. \n \nCheck the child’s pulse if they seem unwell. Report a very slow or very fast heart rate to their doctor. \n \n \nChildren under 3 years \nThis medicine is formulated as an oral formulation and a dose specifically for use in children and \nadolescents aged 3 years and older. \nSialanar is not recommended for children under 3 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Sialanar \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular taking Sialanar with the following medicines can affect the way Sialanar or the listed \nmedicine works or can increase the risk of side effects: \n\n• potassium chloride solid oral dose (see section above “Do not give Sialanar if the child or \nadolescent:”)  \n\n• anticholinergic medicines (see section above “Do not give Sialanar if the child or \nadolescent:”)    \n\n• antispasmodics used to treat sickness or vomiting e.g.domperidone and metaclopramide \n• topiramate used to treat epilepsy \n• antihistamines, used to treat some allergies \n• neuroleptics/antipsychotics (clozapine, haloperidol, phenothiazine), used to treat some \n\nmental illnesses \n• skeletal muscle relaxants (botulinum toxin) \n• antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants)  \n• opioids used to treat severe pain \n• corticosteroids, used to treat inflammatory diseases  \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist for further information about medicines to avoid whilst taking \nSialanar.   \n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nLong-term use \nThe long-term efficacy and safety of Sialanar has not been studied beyond 24 weeks of use. Continued \nuse of Sialanar should be discussed with the child’s doctor every 3 months to check that Sialanar is \nstill right for the child.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThis medicine is intended for use in children and adolescents. Sialanar must not be given if the patient \nis pregnant (or could be pregnant), or is breast-feeding (see section 2 ‘Do not give’).

This may affect performance at skilled tasks such as \ndriving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. After receiving Sialanar, the patient should not drive a \nvehicle, ride a bicycle or use a machine until the effect in their vision and co-ordination has \ncompletely recovered. Ask your doctor if you need further advice. \n \nSialanar contains sodium and benzoate salt (E211) \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium \nfree’.

Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nChildren and adolescents 3 years to less than 18 years: \nYour doctor will decide the correct dose of Sialanar. The initial dose will be calculated based on the \nweight of the child.  Dose increases will be decided by the child’s doctor, using the table below as a \nguide, and will depend on both the effect of Sialanar and any side effects the patient is experiencing \n(this is why several dose levels appear in the table below). Section 4 includes possible side effects \nrelated to the use of Sialanar. These should be discussed with the child’s doctor at all medical \nconsultations, including those for dose increases and decreases, and at any other time should you be \nconcerned.  \n \nThe child should be monitored at regular intervals (at least every 3 months) to check that Sialanar is \nstill the right treatment for them. \n \n\nWeight Dose Level 1  Dose Level 2 Dose Level 3 Dose Level 4 Dose Level 5 \nkg ml ml ml ml ml \n\n13-17 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 3.0 \n18-22 0.8 1.6 2.4 3.2 4.0 \n23-27 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 \n28-32 1.2 2.4 3.6 4.8 6.0 \n33-37 1.4 2.8 4.2 5.6 6.0 \n38-42 1.6 3.2 4.8 6.0 6.0 \n43-47 1.8 3.6 5.4 6.0 6.0 \n≥48 2.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 \n\n \n \nGive the dose prescribed by your doctor to the child three times each day. \nThe dose should be given 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. \nIt is important that the dose is given at consistent times in relation to food intake.

Do not give a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you stop giving Sialanar to your child \nWithdrawal effects are not expected when stopping Sialanar. The child’s doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment with Sialanar if side effects cannot be managed by reducing the dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions about the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
