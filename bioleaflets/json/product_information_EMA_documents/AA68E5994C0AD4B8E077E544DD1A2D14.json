QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 100 mg of pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution (see section 6.6), each vial contains 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white lyophilised powder or solid. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of \n\nchemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. \n\n \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment \n\nof patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than \n\npredominantly squamous cell histology (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally \n\nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell \n\nhistology in patients whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based \n\nchemotherapy (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients \n\nwith locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi must only be administered under the supervision of a physician \n\nqualified in the use of anti-cancer chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin \n\nThe recommended dose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) \n\nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately \n\n30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\nPatients must receive adequate anti-emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or \n\nafter receiving cisplatin (see section 6.2 and cisplatin Summary of Product Characteristics for \n\nspecific dosing advice). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi as single agent \n\nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended \n\ndose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion \n\nover 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\n \n\nPre-medication regimen \n\nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day \n\nprior to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be \n\nequivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation \n\n(see section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 \n\nto 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the \n\nseven days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full \n\ncourse of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an \n\nintramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of \n\npemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be \n\ngiven on the same day as pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nMonitoring \n\nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood \n\ncount, including a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each \n\nchemotherapy administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and \n\nhepatic function. Before the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the \n\nfollowing: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be \n\n≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. \n\nCreatinine clearance should be ≥ 45 ml/min. \n\nThe total bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), \n\naspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) \n\nshould be ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT ≤ 5 times upper \n\nlimit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments \n\nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic \n\ncounts or maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment \n\nmay be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated \n\nusing the guidelines in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nused as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin - Haematologic toxicities \n\nNadir ANC < 500 /mm3 and nadir platelets \n\n≥ 50,000 /mm3 \n\n75 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000 /mm3 regardless of \n\nnadir ANC \n\n75 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000 /mm3 with bleedinga, \n\nregardless of nadir ANC \n\n50 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\na These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI \n\n1998) definition of ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding. \n\n \n\nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), Pemetrexed \n\nFresenius Kabi should be withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s \n\npre-therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to the guidelines in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin-Non-haematologic toxicities a, b \n\n Dose of pemetrexed  \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nDose for cisplatin \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nAny Grade 3 or 4 toxicities except \n\nmucositis \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nAny diarrhoea requiring \n\nhospitalisation (irrespective of \n\ngrade) or grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea. \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nGrade 3 or 4 mucositis 50 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \nb Excluding neurotoxicity \n\n \n\nIn the event of neurotoxicity, the recommended dose adjustment for Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nand cisplatin is documented in Table 3. Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 \n\nneurotoxicity is observed. \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin-Neurotoxicity \n\nCTC a Grade Dose of pemetrexed  \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nDose for cisplatin \n\n(mg/m2) \n\n0-1 100 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\n2 100 % of previous dose 50 % of previous dose \n\na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \n\n \n\nTreatment with Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be discontinued if a patient experiences any \n\nhaematologic or non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately \n\nif Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at \n\nincreased risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose \n\nreductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in the paediatric population in malignant \n\npleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment  \n\n(Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or Glomerular Filtration Rate measured Tc99m-DPTA \n\nserum clearance method) \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients \n\nwith creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those \n\nrecommended for all patients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients \n\nwith creatinine clearance below 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \n\npharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin \n\n> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of \n\nnormal (hepatic metastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases \n\npresent) have not been specifically studied. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes \n\non the first day of each 21-day cycle.  \n\n \n\nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi before \n\nadministration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, \n\nthrombocytopenia and anaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually \n\nthe dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy \n\nand pemetrexed should not be given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to \n\n≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for \n\nsubsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic \n\ntoxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as \n\nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when \n\npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated \n\nwith pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure \n\nto reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment \n\nwith dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n45 ml/min. Therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min \n\nis not recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) \n\nshould avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and \n\nacetylsalicylic acid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following \n\npemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs \n\nwith long elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, \n\nand at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or \n\nin association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred \n\nhad underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or \n\npre-existing hypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis \n\nwere also reported in post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other \n\nchemotherapeutic agents. Most of these events resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients \n\nshould be regularly monitored for acute tubular necrosis, decreased renal function and signs and \n\nsymptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. hypernatraemia). \n\n \n\nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully \n\ndefined. \n\nA phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid \n\ndemonstrated no difference in pemetrexed dose normalized plasma concentrations or clearance \n\ncompared to patients without third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid \n\ncollection prior to pemetrexed treatment should be considered, but may not be necessary. \n\n \n\nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \n\ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment \n\nand appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have \n\nbeen uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in \n\ncombination with another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been \n\nobserved had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live \n\nattenuated vaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to \n\nfather a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or \n\nabstinence are recommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing \n\nirreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\npemetrexed (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, \n\nduring or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these \n\npatients and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or \n\nyears previously. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent \n\nby glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g. \n\naminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in \n\ndelayed clearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, \n\ncreatinine clearance should be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, \n\npenicillin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made \n\nwhen these medicinal product are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance \n\nshould be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min), high doses of \n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal product (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) \n\nand acetylsalicylic acid at higher dose (≥ 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, \n\nconsequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse events. Therefore, caution should \n\nbe made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, concurrently with \npemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to \n\n79 ml/min), the concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or \n\nacetylsalicylic acid at higher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days \n\nfollowing pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such \n\nas piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild \n\nto moderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, \n\nand at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant \n\nadministration of NSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, \n\nespecially myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human \n\nliver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically \n\nsignificant inhibition of the metabolic clearance of medicinal product metabolised by CYP3A, \n\nCYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2. \n\n \n\nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \n\nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment \n\nis frequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \n\npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require \n\nincreased frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat \n\nthe patient with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use contraindicated \n\nYellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nLive attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which concomitant use is contraindicated): \n\nrisk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in subjects who are already \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nimmunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine where it exists \n\n(poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\npemetrexed. Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are \n\nadvised not to father a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive \n\nmeasures or abstinence are recommended. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other \n\nanti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \n\npregnancy. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed \n\nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of \n\nthe needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the \n\nsuckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \n\ntherapy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised \n\nto seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\nHowever, it has been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore patients should be \n\ncautioned against driving or operating machines if this event occurs. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, \n\nneutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as \n\nanorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other \n\nundesirable effects include renal toxicities, increased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, \n\ndehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy. Rarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe table below provides the frequency and severity of undesirable effects that have been \n\nreported in > 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin \n\nand pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma randomised to receive single agent \n\ncisplatin.

Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had \n\npre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. \n\n \n\nRare cases of hepatitis, potentially serious, have been reported during clinical studies with \n\npemetrexed. \n\n \n\nPancytopenia has been uncommonly reported during clinical trials with pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, cases of colitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, \n\nintestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis) have been reported uncommonly in \n\npatients treated with pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, cases of interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency, sometimes fatal, \n\nhave been reported uncommonly in patients treated with pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nUncommon cases of oedema have been reported in patients treated with pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nOesophagitis/ radiation oesophagitis has been uncommonly reported during clinical trials with \n\npemetrexed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nSepsis, sometimes fatal, has been commonly reported during clinical trials with pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nDuring post marketing surveillance, the following adverse reactions have been reported in \n\npatients treated with pemetrexed: \n\n \n\nHyperpigmentation has been commonly reported. \n\n \n\nUncommon cases of acute renal failure have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in \n\nassociation with other chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.4). Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \n\nand renal tubular necrosis have been reported in post marketing setting with an unknown \n\nfrequency. \n\n \n\nUncommon cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation \n\neither prior, during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRare cases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who have received radiotherapy \n\npreviously (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nUncommon cases of peripheral ischaemia leading sometimes to extremity necrosis have been \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nRare cases of bullous conditions have been reported including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and \n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis which in some cases were fatal. \n\n \n\nRarely, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia has been reported in patients treated with \n\npemetrexed. \n\n \n\nRare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. \n\n \n\nErythematous oedema mainly of the lower limbs has been reported with an unknown frequency.  \n\nInfectious and non-infectious disorders of the dermis, the hypodermis and/or the subcutaneous \n\ntissue have been reported with an unknown frequency (e.g. acute bacterial dermo-hypodermitis, \n\npseudocellulitis, dermatitis). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \n\nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nReported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, \n\nsensory polyneuropathy and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow \n\nsuppression as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection \n\nwith or without fever, diarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected \n\noverdose, patients should be monitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy \n\nas necessary. The use of calcium folinate / folinic acid in the management of pemetrexed \n\noverdose should be considered. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04 \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting \n\ncrucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting \n\nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \n\nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo \n\nbiosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both \n\nthe reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the \n\ncell, pemetrexed is rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme \n\nfolylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more \n\npotent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time-and concentration-dependent \n\nprocess that occurs in tumour cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated \n\nmetabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in \n\nmalignant cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nMesothelioma \n\n \n\nEMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\nversus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that \n\npatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median \n\nsurvival advantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone. \n\n \n\nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to \n\npatients’ therapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the \n\npopulation of all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug \n\n(randomised and treated). A subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic \n\nacid and vitamin B12 supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully \n\nsupplemented).

Statistically significant differences in pulmonary function tests were also observed. The \n\nseparation between the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the \n\npemetrexed /cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed \n\nalone. Pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive \n\npatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. \n\n \n\nNSCLC, second-line treatment \n\n \n\nA multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients \n\nwith locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median \n\nsurvival times of 8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (Intent To Treat population \n\nn = 283) and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288). Prior chemotherapy \n\ndid not include pemetrexed. An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment \n\neffect on overall survival was in favour of pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than \n\npredominantly squamous histologies (n = 399, 9.3 versus 8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% \n\nCI = 0 .61-1.00, p = 0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for squamous cell carcinoma \n\nhistology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed \n\nwithin the histology subgroups. \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data from a separate randomized, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy \n\ndata (overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients \n\npreviously pre treated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous \n\ndocetaxel treatment (n = 540). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed vs docetaxel in NSCLC - ITT population \n\n  Pemetrexed  Docetaxel \n\nSurvival time (months) \n\n▪ Median (m) \n▪ 95% CI for median \n▪ HR \n▪ 95% CI for HR \n▪ Non-inferiority p-value (HR) \n\n(n = 283) \n\n8.3 \n\n(7.0-9.4) \n\n(n = 288) \n\n7.9 \n\n(6.3-9.2) \n\n0.99 \n\n(0.82-1.20) \n\n0.226 \n\nProgression-free survival (months) \n\n▪ Median \n▪ HR (95% CI) \n\n(n = 283) \n\n2.9 \n\n(n = 288) \n\n2.9 \n\n0.97 (0.82-1.16) \n\nTime to treatment failure (TTTF - months) \n\n▪ Median \n▪ HR (95% CI) \n\n(n = 283) \n\n2.3 \n\n(n = 288) \n\n2.1 \n\n0.84 (0.71-0.997) \n\nResponse (n: qualified for response) \n\n▪ Response rate (%) (95% CI) \n▪ Stable disease (%) \n\n(n = 264) \n\n9.1 (5.9-13.2) \n\n45.8 \n\n(n = 274) \n\n8.8 (5.7-12.8) \n\n46.4 \n\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; N = total \n\npopulation size. \n\n \n\nNSCLC, first-line treatment \n\n \n\nA multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus \n\ngemcitabine plus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage \n\nIIIb or IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed that pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\n(Intent-To-Treat [ITT] population n = 862) met its primary endpoint and showed similar clinical \n\nefficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin (ITT n = 863) in overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio \n\n0.94; 95% CI = 0.84-1.05). All patients included in this study had an ECOG performance status \n\n0 or 1. \n\nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main \n\nefficacy endpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy \n\nanalyses using PQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and \n\nsupport the non-inferiority of PC versus GC. \n\nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \n\nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine \n\nplus cisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was \n\n30.6% (95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0-31.4) \n\nfor gemcitabine plus cisplatin.

Patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and \n\nsafety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) \n\ntherapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and \n\n3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed ≥ 6 cycles and a total of 103 \n\npatients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed. \n\n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in \n\nthe pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median \n\nof 4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < \n\n0.00001). The independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator \n\nassessment of PFS. The median OS for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the \n\npemetrexed arm and 10.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.65-0.95, p \n\n= 0.01192). \n\n \nConsistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC \n\nhistology was observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology (n = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 \n\nmonths for the pemetrexed arm and 1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 \n\n(95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001).

Of the 939 patients treated \n\nwith pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to maintenance \n\ntreatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a \n\ncomplete/partial response and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin induction. Patients randomised to maintenance treatment were required to have \n\nan ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The median time from the start of pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin induction therapy to the start of maintenance treatment was 2.96 months on both \n\nthe pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. Randomised patients received maintenance \n\ntreatment until disease progression.

For randomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin first line induction treatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for \n\nthe pemetrexed arm and 5.6 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59 95% CI = \n\n0.47-0.74). \n\n \nFollowing pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was \n\nstatistically superior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard \n\nratio = 0.78, 95%CI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, \n\n28.7% of patients were alive or lost to follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on \n\nthe placebo arm.  The relative treatment effect of pemetrexed was internally consistent \n\nacross subgroups (including disease stage, induction response, ECOG PS, smoking status, \n\ngender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the unadjusted OS and PFS \n\nanalyses. The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on pemetrexed were 58% and \n\n32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo.  From the start of \n\npemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 \n\nmonths for the pemetrexed arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, \n\n95% CI= 0.64-0.96).

Pemetrexed has a \n\nsteady-state volume of distribution of 9 l/m\n2\n. In Vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is \n\napproximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. Binding was not notably affected by \n\nvarying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. \n\nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the administered \n\ndose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following \n\nadministration. In Vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 \n\n(organic anion transporter). Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the \n\nelimination half-life from plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function \n\n(creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). \n\nBetween patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. Pemetrexed total systemic \n\nexposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The \n\npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently \nadministered cisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do \n\nnot affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased \n\nfoetal weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. \n\n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by \n\nreduced fertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nbolus injection for 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous \n\nepithelium) have been observed. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. \n\nFemale fertility was not investigated. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese \n\nhamster ovary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in \n\nvivo micronucleus test in the mouse. \n\n \nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n \n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol (E421) \n\nHydrochloric acid (E507) (pH adjustment) \n\nTrometamol (pH adjustment) \n\n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nPemetrexed is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated \n\nRinger’s injection and Ringer’s injection. In the absence of other compatibility studies this \n\nmedicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. \n\n \nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi contains trometamol as an excipient. Trometamol is incompatible \nwith cisplatin resulting in degradation of cisplatin. This medicinal product must not be mixed \nwith other medicinal products. Intravenous lines should be flushed after administration of \nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. \n\n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n\n2 years. \n \n\nReconstituted and infusion solutions \n\nWhen prepared as directed, reconstituted and infusion solutions of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\ncontain no antimicrobial preservatives. Chemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted \n\nsolutions of pemetrexed was demonstrated for 24 hours at refrigerated temperature.   \n\n \n\nFor infusion solution of pemetrexed, chemical and physical in-use stability was demonstrated \n\nfor 21 days  at refrigerated temperature and 7 days at room temperature. From a microbiological \n\npoint of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage \n\ntimes and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer than \n\n24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic \n\nconditions. \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \nType I, clear, colourless glass vial, with 20 mm chlorobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with \n\ngreen flip-off aluminium seal. \n\n \n\nPack of 1 vial. \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n- Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for \n\nintravenous infusion administration. \n \n- Calculate the dose and the number of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi vials needed. Each vial \n\ncontains an excess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount. \n\n \n- Reconstitute 100-mg vials with 4.2 ml of 5% glucose intravenous infusion resulting in a \n\nsolution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is \n\ncompletely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in colour from colourless \n\nto yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. The pH of the \n\nreconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is required. \n\n \n\n- The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to \n100 ml with 5% glucose intravenous infusion and administered as an intravenous infusion \n\nover 10 minutes. \n\n \n- Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl \n\nchloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. \n \n- Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not \n\nadminister. \n- Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste \n\nmaterial must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \nPreparation and administration precautions \n\nAs with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \n\npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a \n\npemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and \n\nwater. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. \n\nPregnant women must avoid contact with cytostatic medicinal product. Pemetrexed is not a \n\nvesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \n\nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the \n\ninvestigator. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-\n\nvesicants. \n \n \n\n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of \n\nchemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. \n\n \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment \n\nof patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than \n\npredominantly squamous cell histology (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally \n\nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell \n\nhistology in patients whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based \n\nchemotherapy (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients \n\nwith locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi must only be administered under the supervision of a physician \n\nqualified in the use of anti-cancer chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin \n\nThe recommended dose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) \n\nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately \n\n30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\nPatients must receive adequate anti-emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or \n\nafter receiving cisplatin (see section 6.2 and cisplatin Summary of Product Characteristics for \n\nspecific dosing advice). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi as single agent \n\nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended \n\ndose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion \n\nover 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\n \n\nPre-medication regimen \n\nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day \n\nprior to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be \n\nequivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation \n\n(see section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 \n\nto 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the \n\nseven days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full \n\ncourse of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an \n\nintramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of \n\npemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be \n\ngiven on the same day as pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nMonitoring \n\nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood \n\ncount, including a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each \n\nchemotherapy administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and \n\nhepatic function. Before the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the \n\nfollowing: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be \n\n≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. \n\nCreatinine clearance should be ≥ 45 ml/min. \n\nThe total bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), \n\naspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) \n\nshould be ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT ≤ 5 times upper \n\nlimit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments \n\nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic \n\ncounts or maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment \n\nmay be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated \n\nusing the guidelines in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nused as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin - Haematologic toxicities \n\nNadir ANC < 500 /mm3 and nadir platelets \n\n≥ 50,000 /mm3 \n\n75 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000 /mm3 regardless of \n\nnadir ANC \n\n75 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000 /mm3 with bleedinga, \n\nregardless of nadir ANC \n\n50 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\na These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI \n\n1998) definition of ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding. \n\n \n\nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), Pemetrexed \n\nFresenius Kabi should be withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s \n\npre-therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to the guidelines in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin-Non-haematologic toxicities a, b \n\n Dose of pemetrexed  \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nDose for cisplatin \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nAny Grade 3 or 4 toxicities except \n\nmucositis \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nAny diarrhoea requiring \n\nhospitalisation (irrespective of \n\ngrade) or grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea. \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nGrade 3 or 4 mucositis 50 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \nb Excluding neurotoxicity \n\n \n\nIn the event of neurotoxicity, the recommended dose adjustment for Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nand cisplatin is documented in Table 3. Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 \n\nneurotoxicity is observed. \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin-Neurotoxicity \n\nCTC a Grade Dose of pemetrexed  \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nDose for cisplatin \n\n(mg/m2) \n\n0-1 100 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\n2 100 % of previous dose 50 % of previous dose \n\na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \n\n \n\nTreatment with Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be discontinued if a patient experiences any \n\nhaematologic or non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately \n\nif Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at \n\nincreased risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose \n\nreductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in the paediatric population in malignant \n\npleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment  \n\n(Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or Glomerular Filtration Rate measured Tc99m-DPTA \n\nserum clearance method): Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nclinical studies, patients with creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments \n\nother than those recommended for all patients. There are insufficient data on the use of \n\npemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance below 45 ml/min; therefore the use of \n\npemetrexed is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \n\npharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin \n\n> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of \n\nnormal (hepatic metastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases \n\npresent) have not been specifically studied. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes \n\non the first day of each 21-day cycle.  \n\n \n\nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi before \n\nadministration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, \n\nthrombocytopenia and anaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually \n\nthe dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy \n\nand pemetrexed should not be given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to \n\n≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for \n\nsubsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic \n\ntoxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as \n\nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when \n\npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated \n\nwith pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure \n\nto reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment \n\nwith dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n45 ml/min. Therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min \n\nis not recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) \n\nshould avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal product (NSAIDs) such as \n\nibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days \n\nfollowing pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs \n\nwith long elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, \n\nand at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or \n\nin association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred \n\nhad underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or \n\npre-existing hypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis \n\nwere also reported in post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other \n\nchemotherapeutic agents. Most of these events resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients \n\nshould be regularly monitored for acute tubular necrosis, decreased renal function and signs and \n\nsymptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. hypernatraemia). \n\n \n\nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully \n\ndefined. \n\nA phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid \n\ndemonstrated no difference in pemetrexed dose normalized plasma concentrations or clearance \n\ncompared to patients without third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid \n\ncollection prior to pemetrexed treatment should be considered, but may not be necessary. \n\n \n\nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \n\ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment \n\nand appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have \n\nbeen uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in \n\ncombination with another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been \n\nobserved had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live \n\nattenuated vaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to \n\nfather a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or \n\nabstinence are recommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing \n\nirreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\npemetrexed (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, \n\nduring or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these \n\npatients and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or \n\nyears previously. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent \n\nby glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g. \n\naminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in \n\ndelayed clearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, \n\ncreatinine clearance should be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, \n\npenicillin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made \n\nwhen these medicinal product are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance \n\nshould be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min), high doses of \n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal product (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) \n\nand acetylsalicylic acidat higher dose (≥ 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, \n\nconsequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse events. Therefore, caution should \n\nbe made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, concurrently with \n\npemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to \n\n79 ml/min), the concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or \n\nacetylsalicylic acidat higher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days \n\nfollowing pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such \n\nas piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild \n\nto moderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, \n\nand at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant \n\nadministration of NSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, \n\nespecially myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human \n\nliver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically \n\nsignificant inhibition of the metabolic clearance of medicinal product metabolised by CYP3A, \n\nCYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2. \n\n \n\nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \n\nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment \n\nis frequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \n\npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require \n\nincreased frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat \n\nthe patient with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use contraindicated \n\nYellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nLive attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which concomitant use is contraindicated): \n\nrisk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in subjects who are already \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nimmunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine where it exists \n\n(poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\npemetrexed. Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are \n\nadvised not to father a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive \n\nmeasures or abstinence are recommended. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other \n\nanti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \n\npregnancy. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed \n\nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of \n\nthe needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the \n\nsuckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \n\ntherapy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised \n\nto seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\nHowever, it has been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore patients should be \n\ncautioned against driving or operating machines if this event occurs. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, \n\nneutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as \n\nanorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04 \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting \n\ncrucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting \n\nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \n\nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo \n\nbiosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both \n\nthe reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the \n\ncell, pemetrexed is rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme \n\nfolylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more \n\npotent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time-and concentration-dependent \n\nprocess that occurs in tumour cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated \n\nmetabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in \n\nmalignant cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nMesothelioma \n\n \n\nEMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\nversus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that \n\npatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median \n\nsurvival advantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone. \n\n \n\nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to \n\npatients’ therapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the \n\npopulation of all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug \n\n(randomised and treated). A subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic \n\nacid and vitamin B12 supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully \n\nsupplemented).

Statistically significant differences in pulmonary function tests were also observed. The \n\nseparation between the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the \n\npemetrexed /cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed \n\nalone. Pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive \n\npatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. \n\n \n\nNSCLC, second-line treatment \n\n \n\nA multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients \n\nwith locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median \n\nsurvival times of 8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (Intent To Treat population \n\nn = 283) and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288). Prior chemotherapy \n\ndid not include pemetrexed. An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment \n\neffect on overall survival was in favour of pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than \n\npredominantly squamous histologies (n = 399, 9.3 versus 8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% \n\nCI = 0 .61-1.00, p = 0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for squamous cell carcinoma \n\nhistology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed \n\nwithin the histology subgroups. \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data from a separate randomized, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy \n\ndata (overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients \n\npreviously pre treated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous \n\ndocetaxel treatment (n = 540). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed vs docetaxel in NSCLC - ITT population \n\n  Pemetrexed  Docetaxel \n\nSurvival time (months) \n\n▪ Median (m) \n▪ 95% CI for median \n▪ HR \n▪ 95% CI for HR \n▪ Non-inferiority p-value (HR) \n\n(n = 283) \n\n8.3 \n\n(7.0-9.4) \n\n(n = 288) \n\n7.9 \n\n(6.3-9.2) \n\n0.99 \n\n(0.82-1.20) \n\n0.226 \n\nProgression-free survival (months) \n\n▪ Median \n▪ HR (95% CI) \n\n(n = 283) \n\n2.9 \n\n(n = 288) \n\n2.9 \n\n0.97 (0.82-1.16) \n\nTime to treatment failure (TTTF - months) \n\n▪ Median \n▪ HR (95% CI) \n\n(n = 283) \n\n2.3 \n\n(n = 288) \n\n2.1 \n\n0.84 (0.71-0.997) \n\nResponse (n: qualified for response) \n\n▪ Response rate (%) (95% CI) \n▪ Stable disease (%) \n\n(n = 264) \n\n9.1 (5.9-13.2) \n\n45.8 \n\n(n = 274) \n\n8.8 (5.7-12.8) \n\n46.4 \n\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; N = total \n\npopulation size. \n\n \n\nNSCLC, first-line treatment \n\n \n\nA multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus \n\ngemcitabine plus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage \n\nIIIb or IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed that pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\n(Intent-To-Treat [ITT] population n = 862) met its primary endpoint and showed similar clinical \n\nefficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin (ITT n = 863) in overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio \n\n0.94; 95% CI = 0.84-1.05). All patients included in this study had an ECOG performance status \n\n0 or 1. \n\nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main \n\nefficacy endpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy \n\nanalyses using PQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and \n\nsupport the non-inferiority of PC versus GC. \n\nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \n\nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine \n\nplus cisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was \n\n30.6% (95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0-31.4) \n\nfor gemcitabine plus cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review \n\n(400/1725 patients were randomly selected for review). \n\nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically \n\nrelevant differences in survival according to histology, see table below. \n\n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed + cisplatin vs. gemcitabine + cisplatin in first-line non-small cell \n\nlung cancer – ITT population and histology subgroups. \n\n \n\n \n\nITT population \n\nand histology \n\nsubgroups \n\nMedian overall survival in months \n\n(95% CI) \n\nAdjusted \n\nhazard ratio \n\n(HR) (95% \n\nCI) \n\n \n\nSuperiority \n\np-value \nPemetrexed + cisplatin \n\nGemcitabine + \n\ncisplatin \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nITT population \n\nand histology \n\nsubgroups \n\nMedian overall survival in months \n\n(95% CI) \n\nAdjusted \n\nhazard ratio \n\n(HR) (95% \n\nCI) \n\n \n\nSuperiority \n\np-value \nPemetrexed + cisplatin \n\nGemcitabine + \n\ncisplatin \n\nITT population \n\n(N = 1725) \n\n10.3 \n\n(9.8 – 11.2) \n\nN=862 10.3 \n\n(9.6 – 10.9) \n\nN=863 0.94a \n\n(0.84 – 1.05) \n\n0.259 \n\nAdenocarcinoma \n\n(N=847) \n\n12.6  \n\n(10.7 – 13.6) \n\nN=436 10.9  \n\n(10.2 – 11.9) \n\nN=411 0.84 \n\n(0.71–0.99) \n\n0.033 \n\nLarge cell \n\n(N=153) \n\n10.4 \n\n(8.6 – 14.1) \n\nN=76 6.7 \n\n(5.5 – 9.0) \n\nN=77 0.67 \n\n(0.48–0.96) \n\n0.027 \n\nOther \n\n(N=252) \n\n8.6 \n\n(6.8 – 10.2) \n\nN=106 9.2 \n\n(8.1 – 10.6) \n\nN=146 1.08 \n\n(0.81–1.45) \n\n0.586 \n\nSquamous cell \n\n(N=473) \n\n9.4 \n\n(8.4 – 10.2) \n\nN=244 10.8 \n\n(9.5 – 12.1) \n\nN=229 1.23 \n\n(1.00–1.51) \n\n0.050 \n\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; N = total population size. \naStatistically significant for noninferiority, with the entire confidence interval for HR well \n\nbelow the 1.17645 noninferiority margin (p <0.001). \n\n \n\nKaplan Meier plots of overall survival by histology \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAbbreviations: PC=Pemetrexed+cisplatin; GC= Gemcitabine+cisplatin \n\n \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed \n\nplus cisplatin within the histology subgroups. \n\nPatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% versus \n\n28.9%, p<0.001), red blood cell transfusions (16.1% versus 27.3%, p<0.001) and platelet \n\ntransfusions (1.8% versus 4.5%, p=0.002).

First line doublet therapy containing \n\npemetrexed was not included. All patients included in this study had an ECOG performance \n\nstatus 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and \n\nsafety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) \n\ntherapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and \n\n3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed ≥ 6 cycles and a total of 103 \n\npatients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed. \n\n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in \n\nthe pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median \n\nof 4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < \n\n0.00001). The independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator \n\nassessment of PFS. The median OS for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the \n\npemetrexed arm and 10.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.65-0.95, p \n\n= 0.01192). \n\n \nConsistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC \n\nhistology was observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology (n = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 \n\nmonths for the pemetrexed arm and 1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 \n\n(95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001). The median OS for patients with NSCLC other than \n\npredominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was 15.5 months for the pemetrexed arm \n\nand 10.3 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). \n\nIncluding the induction phase the median OS for patients with NSCLC other than \n\npredominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the pemetrexed arm and 13.6 \n\nmonths for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). \n\n \nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for \n\npemetrexed over placebo. \n \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed \n\nwithin the histology subgroups. \n\n \n\nJMEN: Kaplan Meier plots of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival \n\npemetrexed versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nPARAMOUNT \n\nA multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study \n\n(PARAMOUNT), compared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment \n\nwith pemetrexed plus BSC (N = 359) with that of placebo plus BSC (N = 180) in patients \n\nwith locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than \n\npredominantly squamous cell histology who did not progress after 4 cycles of first-line \n\ndoublet therapy of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin. Of the 939 patients treated \n\nwith pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to maintenance \n\ntreatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a \n\ncomplete/partial response and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin induction. Patients randomised to maintenance treatment were required to have \n\nan ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The median time from the start of pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin induction therapy to the start of maintenance treatment was 2.96 months on both \n\nthe pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. Randomised patients received maintenance \n\ntreatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of \n\nrandomisation after completion of first-line (induction) therapy. Patients received a \n\nmedian of 4 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and 4 cycles of placebo. A \n\ntotal of 169 patients (47.1%) completed ≥ 6 cycles maintenance treatment with \n\npemetrexed, representing at least 10 total cycles of pemetrexed. \n\n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in \n\nthe pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 472, independently reviewed population; median \n\nof 3.9 months and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.81, p = \n\n0.0002). The independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator \n\nassessment of PFS. For randomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin first line induction treatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for \n\nthe pemetrexed arm and 5.6 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59 95% CI = \n\n0.47-0.74). \n\n \nFollowing pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was \n\nstatistically superior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard \n\nratio = 0.78, 95%CI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, \n\n28.7% of patients were alive or lost to follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on \n\nthe placebo arm.  The relative treatment effect of pemetrexed was internally consistent \n\nacross subgroups (including disease stage, induction response, ECOG PS, smoking status, \n\ngender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the unadjusted OS and PFS \n\nanalyses. The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on pemetrexed were 58% and \n\n32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo.  From the start of \n\npemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 \n\nmonths for the pemetrexed arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, \n\n95% CI= 0.64-0.96). The percentage of patients that received post study treatment was \n\n64.3% for pemetrexed and 71.7% for placebo. \n \nPARAMOUNT: Kaplan Meier plot of progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall \n\nSurvival (OS) for continuation pemetrexed maintenance versus placebo in patients with \n\nNSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (measured from \n\nrandomisation) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n \nThe pemetrexed maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT \n\nwere similar. \n\n \nPaediatric population  \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nthe reference medicinal product containing pemetrexed in all subsets of the paediatric population \n\nin the granted indications (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration \n\nhave been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses \n\nranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m\n2 \n\ninfused over a 10-minute period. Pemetrexed has a \n\nsteady-state volume of distribution of 9 l/m\n2\n. In Vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is \n\napproximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. Binding was not notably affected by \n\nvarying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. \n\nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the administered \n\ndose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following \n\nadministration. In Vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 \n\n(organic anion transporter). Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the \n\nelimination half-life from plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function \n\n(creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). \n\nBetween patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. Pemetrexed total systemic \n\nexposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The \n\npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently \nadministered cisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do \n\nnot affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased \n\nfoetal weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. \n\n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nreduced fertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous \n\nbolus injection for 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous \n\nepithelium) have been observed. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. \n\nFemale fertility was not investigated. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese \n\nhamster ovary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in \n\nvivo micronucleus test in the mouse. \n\n \nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n \n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol (E421) \n\nHydrochloric acid (E507) (pH adjustment) \n\nTrometamol (pH adjustment) \n\n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nPemetrexed is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated \n\nRinger’s injection and Ringer’s injection. In the absence of other compatibility studies this \n\nmedicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi contains trometamol as an excipient. Trometamol is incompatible \nwith cisplatin resulting in degradation of cisplatin. This medicinal product must not be mixed \nwith other medicinal products. Intravenous lines should be flushed after administration of \nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. \n\n \n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \nUnopened vial \n\n2 years. \n \n\nReconstituted and infusion solutions \n\nWhen prepared as directed, reconstituted and infusion solutions of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\ncontain no antimicrobial preservatives. Chemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted \n\nsolutions of pemetrexed was demonstrated for 24 hours at refrigerated temperature.  \n\n \n\nFor infusion solution of pemetrexed, chemical and physical in-use stability was demonstrated \n\nfor 21 days at refrigerated temperature and 7 days at room temperature. From a microbiological \n\npoint of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage \n\ntimes and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer than \n\n24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic \n\nconditions \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \nType I, clear, colourless glass vial, with 20 mm chlorobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with \n\nblue flip-off aluminium seal. \n\n \n\nPack of 1 vial. \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n- Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for \n\nintravenous infusion administration. \n \n- Calculate the dose and the number of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi vials needed. Each vial \n\ncontains an excess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount. \n\n \n- Reconstitute 500-mg vials with 20 ml of 5% glucose intravenous infusion resulting in a \n\nsolution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is \n\ncompletely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in colour from colourless \n\nto yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. The pH of the \n\nreconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is required. \n\n \n- The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to \n\n100 ml with 5% glucose intravenous infusion and administered as an intravenous infusion \n\nover 10 minutes. \n\n \n- Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl \n\nchloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. \n \n- Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not \n\nadminister. \n- Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste \n\nmaterial must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \nPreparation and administration precautions \n\n As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \n\npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a \n\npemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and \n\nwater. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. \n\nPregnant women must avoid contact with cytostatic medicinal product. Pemetrexed is not a \n\nvesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \n\nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the \n\ninvestigator.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of \n\nchemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. \n\n \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment \n\nof patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than \n\npredominantly squamous cell histology (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally \n\nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell \n\nhistology in patients whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based \n\nchemotherapy (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients \n\nwith locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly \n\nsquamous cell histology (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi must only be administered under the supervision of a physician \n\nqualified in the use of anti-cancer chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin \n\nThe recommended dose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) \n\nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\nThe recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 \n\nminutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\nPatients must receive adequate anti-emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or \n\nafter receiving cisplatin (see section 6.2 and cisplatin Summary of Product Characteristics for \n\nspecific dosing advice).  \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi as single agent \n\nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended \n\ndose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion \n\nover 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n\n \n\nPre-medication regimen \n\nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day \n\nprior to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be \n\nequivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation \n\n(see section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 \n\nto 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the \n\nseven days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full \n\ncourse of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an \n\nintramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of \n\npemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be \n\ngiven on the same day as pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nMonitoring \n\nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood \n\ncount, including a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each \n\nchemotherapy administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and \n\nhepatic function. Before the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the \n\nfollowing: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be \n\n≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. \n\n Creatinine clearance should be ≥ 45 ml/min. \n\n \n\nThe total bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), \n\naspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) \n\nshould be ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT ≤ 5 times upper \n\nlimit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments \n\nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic \n\ncounts or maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment \n\nmay be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nusing the guidelines in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nused as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. \n\n \n\nTable 1- Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin - Haematologic toxicities \n\nNadir ANC < 500 /mm3 and nadir platelets \n\n≥ 50,000/mm3 \n\n75 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000 /mm3 regardless of nadir \n\nANC \n\n75 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000 /mm3 with bleedinga, \n\nregardless of nadir ANC \n\n50 % of previous dose (both pemetrexed and \n\ncisplatin) \n\na These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; \n\nNCI 1998) definition of ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding. \n\n \n\nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), Pemetrexed \n\nFresenius Kabi should be withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s \n\npre-therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to the guidelines in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin-Non-haematologic toxicities a, b \n\n Dose of pemetrexed \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nDose for cisplatin \n\n(mg/m2) \n\nAny Grade 3 or 4 toxicities except \n\nmucositis \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nAny diarrhoea requiring \n\nhospitalisation (irrespective of grade) \n\nor grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea. \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nGrade 3 or 4 mucositis 50 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) b Excluding \n\nneurotoxicity \n\n \n\nIn the event of neurotoxicity, the recommended dose adjustment for Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nand cisplatin is documented in Table 3. Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 \n\nneurotoxicity is observed. \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Dose modification table for pemetrexed (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin-Neurotoxicity \n\nCTCa Grade Dose of pemetrexed (mg/m2) Dose for cisplatin \n\n(mg/m2) \n\n0-1 100 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\n2 100 % of previous dose 50 % of previous dose \na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \n\n \n\nTreatment with Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be discontinued if a patient experiences any \n\nhaematologic or non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately \n\nif Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at \n\nincreased risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose \n\nreductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in the paediatric population in malignant \n\npleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment  \n\n(Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or Glomerular Filtration Rate measured Tc99m-DPTA \n\nserum clearance method) \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients \n\nwith creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those \n\nrecommended for all patients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients \n\nwith creatinine clearance below 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \n\npharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin \n\n> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of \n\nnormal (hepatic metastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases \n\npresent) have not been specifically studied. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes \n\non the first day of each 21-day cycle.  \n\n \n\nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi, see \n\nsection 6.6.  \n\n \n\nFor instructions on dilution of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, \n\nthrombocytopenia and anaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually \n\nthe dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy \n\nand pemetrexed should not be given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to \n\n≥ 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for \n\nsubsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic \n\ntoxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as \n\nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when \n\npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated \n\nwith pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure \n\nto reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment \n\nwith dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below \n\n45 ml/min. Therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min \n\nis not recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) \n\nshould avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and \n\nacetylsalicylic acid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following \n\npemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs \n\nwith long elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, \n\nand at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or \n\nin association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred \n\nhad underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or \n\npre-existing hypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis \n\nwere also reported in post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other \n\nchemotherapeutic agents. Most of these events resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients \n\nshould be regularly monitored for acute tubular necrosis, decreased renal function and signs and \n\nsymptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. hypernatraemia). \n\n \n\nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully \n\ndefined. A phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid \n\ndemonstrated no difference in pemetrexed dose normalized plasma concentrations or clearance \n\ncompared to patients without third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid \n\ncollection prior to pemetrexed treatment should be considered, but may not be necessary. Due to \n\nthe gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \n\ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment \n\nand appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have \n\nbeen uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in \n\ncombination with another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been \n\nobserved had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live \n\nattenuated vaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to \n\nfather a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or \n\nabstinence are recommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nirreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\npemetrexed (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, \n\nduring or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these \n\npatients and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. \n\n \n\nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or \n\nyears previously. \n\n \n\nIn patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction accumulation of cyclodextrins may occur. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by \n\nglomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g. \n\naminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in \n\ndelayed clearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, \n\ncreatinine clearance should be closely monitored. \n\nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, \n\npenicillin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made \n\nwhen these  medicinal product are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance \n\nshould be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥80 ml/min), high doses of \n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal product (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) \n\nand acetylsalicylic acid at higher dose (≥1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, \n\nconsequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse events. Therefore, caution should \n\nbe made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, concurrently with \n\npemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min). \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to \n\n79 ml/min), the concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or \n\nacetylsalicylic acid at higher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days \n\nfollowing pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such \n\nas piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild \n\nto moderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, \n\nand at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant \n\nadministration of NSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, \n\nespecially myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human \n\nliver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant \n\ninhibition of the metabolic clearance of medicinal product metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, \n\nCYP2C9, and CYP1A2. \n\n \n\nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \n\nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nis frequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \n\npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require \n\nincreased frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat \n\nthe patient with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use contraindicated  \n\nYellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nLive attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which concomitant use is contraindicated): \n\nrisk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in subjects who are already \n\nimmunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine where it exists \n\n(poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with \n\npemetrexed. Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are \n\nadvised not to father a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive \n\nmeasures or abstinence are recommended. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other \n\nanti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \n\npregnancy. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed \n\nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of \n\nthe needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the \n\nsuckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \n\ntherapy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised \n\nto seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\nHowever, it has been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore patients should \n\nbe cautioned against driving or operating machines if this event occurs. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, \n\nneutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as \n\nanorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other \n\nundesirable effects include renal toxicities, increased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\ndehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04 \n\n \n\nPemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting \n\ncrucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting \n\nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \n\nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo \n\nbiosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both \n\nthe reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the \n\ncell, pemetrexed is rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme \n\nfolylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more \n\npotent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time-and concentration-dependent \n\nprocess that occurs in tumour cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated \n\nmetabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in \n\nmalignant cells. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nMesothelioma \n\n \n\nEMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\nversus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that \n\npatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median \n\nsurvival advantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone. \n\n \n\nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to \n\npatients’ therapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the \n\npopulation of all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug \n\n(randomised and treated). A subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic \n\nacid and vitamin B12 supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully \n\nsupplemented).

Statistically significant differences in pulmonary function tests were also observed. The \n\nseparation between the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the \n\npemetrexed /cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed \n\nalone. Pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive \n\npatients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. \n\n \n\nNSCLC, second-line treatment \n\n \n\nA multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients \n\nwith locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median \n\nsurvival times of 8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (Intent To Treat population \n\nn = 283) and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n=  288). Prior chemotherapy \n\ndid not include pemetrexed. An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment \n\neffect on overall survival was in favour of pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than \n\npredominantly squamous histologies (n = 399, 9.3 versus 8.0 months, adjusted HR=0.78; \n\n95% CI=0.61-1.00, p=0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for squamous cell carcinoma \n\nhistology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR=1.56; 95% CI=1.08-2.26, p=0.018). \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed \n\nwithin the histology subgroups. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data from a separate randomized, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy \n\ndata (overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients \n\npreviously pre treated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous \n\ndocetaxel treatment (n=540). \n\n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed vs docetaxel in NSCLC - ITT population  \nPemetrexed Docetaxel \n\nSurvival time (months) \n\n▪ Median (m) \n▪ 95% CI for median \n▪ HR \n▪ 95% CI for HR \n▪ • Non-inferiority p-value (HR) \n\n(N = 283) \n\n8.3 \n\n(7.0-9.4) \n\n(N = 288) \n\n7.9 \n\n(6.3-9.2) \n\n0.99 \n\n(0.82-1.20) \n\n0.226 \n\nProgression-free survival (months) \n\n▪ Median \n▪ HR (95% CI) \n\n(N = 283) \n\n2.9 \n\n(N = 288) \n\n2.9 \n\n0.97 (0.82-1.16) \n\nTime to treatment failure (TTTF-months) \n\n▪ Median \n▪ HR (95% CI) \n\n(N = 283) \n\n2.3 \n\n(N = 288) \n\n2.1 \n\n0.84 (0.71-0.997) \n\nResponse (n: qualified for response) \n\n▪ Response rate (%) (95% CI) \n▪ Stable disease (%) \n\n(N = 264) \n\n9.1 (5.9-13.2) \n\n45.8 \n\n(N = 274) \n\n8.8 (5.7-12.8) \n\n46.4 \n \nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; N = total \n\npopulation size. \n\n \n\nNSCLC, first-line treatment \n\n \n\nA multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus \n\ngemcitabine plus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage \n\nIIIb or IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed that pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\n(Intent-To-Treat [ITT] population n = 862) met its primary endpoint and showed similar clinical \n\nefficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin (ITT n = 863) in overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio \n\n0.94; 95% CI = 0.84-1.05). All patients included in this study had an ECOG performance status \n\n0 or 1. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main \n\nefficacy endpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy \n\nanalyses using PQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and \n\nsupport the non-inferiority of PC versus GC. \n\n \n\nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \n\nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine \n\nplus cisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was \n\n30.6% (95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI=25.0-31.4) for \n\ngemcitabine plus cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review \n\n(400/1725 patients were randomly selected for review). \n\n \n\nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically \n\nrelevant differences in survival according to histology, see table below. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed + cisplatin vs. gemcitabine + cisplatin in first-line non-small cell \n\nlung cancer – ITT population and histology subgroups. \n\n \n\n \n\nITT population \n\nand histology \n\nsubgroups \n\nMedian overall survival in months \n\n(95% CI) \n\nAdjusted \n\nhazard ratio \n\n(HR) (95% \n\nCI) \n\n \n\nSuperiority \n\np-value \nPemetrexed + cisplatin \n\nGemcitabine + \n\ncisplatin \n\nITT population \n\n(N = 1725) \n\n10.3 \n\n(9.8 – 11.2) \n\nN=862 10.3 \n\n(9.6 – 10.9) \n\nN=863 0.94a \n\n(0.84 – 1.05) \n\n0.259 \n\nAdenocarcinoma \n\n(N=847) \n\n12.6  \n\n(10.7 – 13.6) \n\nN=436 10.9  \n\n(10.2 – 11.9) \n\nN=411 0.84 \n\n(0.71–0.99) \n\n0.033 \n\nLarge cell \n\n(N=153) \n\n10.4 \n\n(8.6 – 14.1) \n\nN=76 6.7 \n\n(5.5 – 9.0) \n\nN=77 0.67 \n\n(0.48–0.96) \n\n0.027 \n\nOther \n\n(N=252) \n\n8.6 \n\n(6.8 – 10.2) \n\nN=106 9.2 \n\n(8.1 – 10.6) \n\nN=146 1.08 \n\n(0.81–1.45) \n\n0.586 \n\nSquamous cell \n\n(N=473) \n\n9.4 \n\n(8.4 – 10.2) \n\nN=244 10.8 \n\n(9.5 – 12.1) \n\nN=229 1.23 \n\n(1.00–1.51) \n\n0.050 \n\n \nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; N = total population size. \naStatistically significant for noninferiority, with the entire confidence interval for HR well below \n\nthe 1.17645 noninferiority margin (p <0.001). \n\n \n\nKaplan Meier plots of overall survival by histology \n\n \nAbbreviations: PC=Pemetrexed+cisplatin; GC= Gemcitabine+cisplatin \n\n \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed plus \n\ncisplatin within the histology subgroups. \n\n \n\nPatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% versus 28.9%, \n\np< 0.001), red blood cell transfusions (16.1% versus 27.3%, p< 0.001) and platelet transfusions \n\n(1.8% versus 4.5%, p=0.002).

First line doublet therapy containing \n\npemetrexed was not included. All patients included in this study had an ECOG performance \n\nstatus 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and \n\nsafety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) \n\ntherapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and \n\n3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed ≥ 6 cycles and a total of 103 \n\npatients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in \n\nthe pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median \n\nof 4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p \n\n< 0.00001). The independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator \n\nassessment of PFS. The median OS for the overall population (n=663) was 13.4 months for the \n\npemetrexed arm and 10.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio= 0.79 (95% CI=0.65-0.95, \n\np= 0.01192). \n\n \n\nConsistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology \n\nwas observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell \n\nhistology (n = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the \n\npemetrexed arm and 1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio=0.47 (95% CI=0.37-0.60, \n\np=0.00001). The median OS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell \n\nhistology (n = 481) was 15.5 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.3 months for the placebo \n\narm, hazard ratio=0.70 (95% CI=0.56-0.88, p=0.002). Including the induction phase the median \n\nOS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months \n\nfor the pemetrexed arm and 13.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio=0.71 \n\n(95% CI=0.56-0.88, p=0.002). \n\n \n\nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for \n\npemetrexed over placebo. \n\n \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed \n\nwithin the histology subgroups. \n\n \n\nJMEN: Kaplan Meier plots of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival \n\npemetrexed versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous \n\ncell histology: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPARAMOUNT \n\nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (PARAMOUNT), \n\ncompared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus \n\nBSC (n=359) with that of placebo plus BSC (n=180) in patients with locally advanced (Stage \n\nIIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology who \n\ndid not progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy of pemetrexed in combination with \n\ncisplatin. Of the 939 patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were \n\nrandomised to maintenance treatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, \n\n44.9% had a complete/partial response and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed \n\nplus cisplatin induction. Patients randomised to maintenance treatment were required to have an \n\nECOG performance status 0 or 1. The median time from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\ninduction therapy to the start of maintenance treatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed \n\narm and the placebo arm. Randomised patients received maintenance treatment until disease \n\nprogression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion \n\nof first-line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 4 cycles of maintenance treatment \n\nwith pemetrexed and 4 cycles of placebo. A total of 169 patients (47.1%) completed ≥ 6 cycles \n\nmaintenance treatment with pemetrexed, representing at least 10 total cycles of pemetrexed. \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in \n\nthe pemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 472, independently reviewed population; median \n\nof 3.9 months and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio= 0.64, 95% CI= 0.51-0.81, p= 0.0002). \n\nThe independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of \n\nPFS. For randomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin first line \n\ninduction treatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the pemetrexed \n\narm and 5.6 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio=0.59 95% CI= 0.47-0.74). \n\n \n\nFollowing pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was \n\nstatistically superior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard \n\nratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96, p= 0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, 28.7% of \n\npatients were alive or lost to follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on the placebo arm. \n\nThe relative treatment effect of pemetrexed was internally consistent across subgroups \n\n(including disease stage, induction response, ECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and \n\nage) and similar to that observed in the unadjusted OS and PFS analyses. The 1 year and 2 year \n\nsurvival rates for patients on pemetrexed were 58% and 32% respectively, compared to 45% and \n\n21% for patients on placebo. From the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction \n\ntreatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 months for the pemetrexed arm and 14.0 months \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nfor the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96). The percentage of patients that \n\nreceived post study treatment was 64.3% for pemetrexed and 71.7% for placebo. \n\n \n\nPARAMOUNT: Kaplan Meier plot of progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall \n\nSurvival (OS) for continuation pemetrexed maintenance versus placebo in patients with \n\nNSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (measured from \n\nrandomisation) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe pemetrexed maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT \n\nwere similar. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nthe reference medicinal product containing pemetrexed in all subsets of the paediatric population \n\nin the granted indications (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been \n\nevaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2 to \n\n838 mg/m2 infused over a 10-minute period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of \n\ndistribution of 9 l/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to \n\nplasma proteins. Binding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. \n\nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the \n\nurine, with 70% to 90% of the administered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the \n\nfirst 24 hours following administration. In Vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively \n\nsecreted by OAT3 (organic anion transporter). Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is \n\n91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal \n\nfunction (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). Between patient variability in clearance is \n\nmoderate at 19.3%. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma \n\nconcentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed are \n\nconsistent over multiple treatment cycles. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered \n\ncisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do not affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased \n\nfoetal weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. \n\n \n\nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by \n\nreduced fertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous \n\nbolus injection for 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous \n\nepithelium) have been observed. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. \n\nFemale fertility was not investigated. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese \n\nhamster ovary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in \n\nvivo micronucleus test in the mouse. \n\n \n\nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

If particulate matter is observed, do not \n\nadminister. \n\n \n\n- Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste \nmaterial must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nPreparation and administration precautions \n\nAs with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \n\npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a \n\npemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and \n\nwater. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. \n\nPregnant women must avoid contact with cytostatic medicinal product. Pemetrexed is not a \n\nvesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the \n\ninvestigator. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other \n\nnon-vesicants. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

What Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is a medicine used in the treatment of cancer. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is given in combination with cisplatin, another anti-cancer medicine, as \n\ntreatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma, a form of cancer that affects the lining of the lung, to \n\npatients who have not received prior chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is also given in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of \n\npatients with advanced stage of lung cancer. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi can be prescribed to you if you have lung cancer at an advanced stage if \n\nyour disease has responded to treatment or it remains largely unchanged after initial chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is also a treatment for patients with advanced stage of lung cancer whose \n\ndisease has progressed after other initial chemotherapy has been used. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

Your doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your \n\ngeneral condition and if your blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your \n\ndoctor will make sure that you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and \n\nafter receiving cisplatin to prevent vomiting. \n\n \n\nIf you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an \n\nearly or late radiation reaction with Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. \n\n \n\nIf you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects \n\nwith Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. \n\n \n\nIf you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid \n\nbefore giving you Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no relevant use of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any medicine for pain or \n\ninflammation (swelling), such as medicines called “nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs” \n\n(NSAIDs), including medicines purchased without a doctor’s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There \n\nare many sorts of NSAIDs with different durations of activity. Based on the planned date of your \n\ninfusion of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi and/or on the status of your kidney function, your doctor \n\nneeds to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you can take them. If you are unsure, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The \n\nuse of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss \n\nwith you the potential risk of taking Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi during pregnancy.

Be careful when driving a car or using \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi \n\n \n\nThe dose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi is 500 milligrams for every square metre of your body’s \n\nsurface area. Your height and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your \n\ndoctor will use this body surface area to work out the right dose for you. This dose may be adjusted, \n\nor treatment may be delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A \n\nhospital pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have mixed the Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi powder with 5% \n\nglucose intravenous infusion before it is given to you. \n\n \n\nYou will always receive Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion \n\nwill last approximately 10 minutes. \n\n \n\nWhen using Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi in combination with cisplatin: \n\nThe doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. \n\nCisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes \n\nafter the infusion of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi has finished. The infusion of cisplatin will last \n\napproximately 2 hours. \n\n \n\nYou should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. \n\n \n\nAdditional medicines: \n\nCorticosteroids: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 milligram of \n\ndexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day \n\nafter Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi treatment. This medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency \n\nand severity of skin reactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment. \n\n \n\nVitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin \n\ncontaining folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking \n\nPemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. You must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first \n\ndose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. You must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last \n\ndose of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi. You will also receive an injection of vitamin B12 \n\n(1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi and then \n\napproximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi treatment). \n\nVitamin B12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the anticancer \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
