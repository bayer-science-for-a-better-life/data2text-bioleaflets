This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nSpravato 28 mg nasal spray, solution\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach nasal spray device contains esketamine hydrochloride corresponding to 28 mg esketamine.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNasal spray, solution.\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSpravato, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant Major \nDepressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with antidepressants\nin the current moderate to severe depressive episode (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe decision to prescribe Spravato should be determined by a psychiatrist.\n\nSpravato is intended to be self-administered by the patient under the direct supervision of a healthcare \nprofessional.\n\nA treatment session consists of nasal administration of Spravato and a post-administration observation\nperiod. Both administration and post-administration observation of Spravato should be carried out in \nan appropriate clinical setting.\n\nAssessment before treatment\nPrior to dosing with Spravato blood pressure should be assessed.\n\nIf baseline blood pressure is elevated the risks of short-term increases in blood pressure and benefit of \nSpravato treatment should be considered (see section 4.4). Spravato should not be administered if an \nincrease in blood pressure or intracranial pressure poses a serious risk (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular or respiratory conditions require\nadditional precautions. In these patients, Spravato should be administered in a setting where \nappropriate resuscitation equipment and healthcare professionals with training in cardiopulmonary \nresuscitation are available (see section 4.4).\n\nPost-administration observation\nAfter dosing with Spravato, blood pressure should be reassessed at approximately 40 minutes and \nsubsequently as clinically warranted (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n3\n\nBecause of the possibility of sedation, dissociation and elevated blood pressure, patients must be \nmonitored by a healthcare professional until the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to \nleave the healthcare setting (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nThe dose recommendations for Spravato are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 (adults \u226565 years). It is \nrecommended to maintain the dose the patient receives at the end of the induction phase in the\nmaintenance phase. Dose adjustments should be made based on efficacy and tolerability to the \nprevious dose. During the maintenance phase, Spravato dosing should be individualised to the lowest \nfrequency to maintain remission/response.\n\nTable 1: Recommended dosing for Spravato in adults <65 years\nInduction phase Maintenance phase\nWeeks 1-4:\nStarting day 1 dose: 56 mg\nSubsequent doses: 56 mg or 84 mg twice a week\n\nWeeks 5-8:\n56 mg or 84 mg once weekly\n\nFrom week 9:\n56 mg or 84 mg every 2 weeks or once \nweekly\n\nEvidence of therapeutic benefit should be evaluated \nat the end of induction phase to determine need for \ncontinued treatment.\n\nThe need for continued treatment should be \nreexamined periodically. \n\nTable 2: Recommended dosing for Spravato in adults \u226565 years\nInduction phase Maintenance phase\nWeeks 1-4:\nStarting day 1 dose: 28 mg\nSubsequent doses: 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg\n\ntwice a week, all dose \nchanges should be in 28 mg \nincrements\n\nWeeks 5-8:\n28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg once weekly, all \ndose changes should be in 28 mg increments\n\nFrom week 9:\n28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg every 2 weeks or \nonce weekly, all dose changes should be in \n28 mg increments\n\nEvidence of therapeutic benefit should be evaluated \nat the end of induction phase to determine need for \ncontinued treatment.\n\nThe need for continued treatment should be \nreexamined periodically.\n\nAfter depressive symptoms improve, treatment is recommended for at least 6 months.\n\nFood and liquid intake recommendations prior to administration\nSince some patients may experience nausea and vomiting after administration of Spravato, patients \nshould be advised not to eat for at least 2 hours before administration and not to drink liquids at least \n30 minutes prior to administration (see section 4.8).\n\nNasal corticosteroid or nasal decongestant\nPatients who require a nasal corticosteroid or nasal decongestant on a dosing day should be advised \nnot to administer these medicinal products within 1 hour before Spravato administration.\n\nMissed treatment session(s)\nIn case one or two treatment sessions are missed, the next session should be scheduled when the next \nsession was scheduled to occur based on current treatment frequency. If more than 2 treatment \nsessions have been missed, per clinical judgment, adjustment of the dose or frequency of Spravato \nmay be clinically appropriate.\n\n\n\n4\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly (65 years of age and older)\nIn elderly patients the initial Spravato dose is 28 mg esketamine (day 1, starting dose, see Table 2\nabove). Subsequent doses should be increased in increments of 28 mg up to 56 mg or 84 mg, based on\nefficacy and tolerability.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild (Child Pugh class A) or moderate (Child Pugh \nclass B) hepatic impairment. However, the maximum dose of 84 mg should be used with caution in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nSpravato has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Use in \nthis population is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Patients on dialysis \nwere not studied.\n\nRace\nFor patients of Japanese ancestry, initial Spravato dose is 28 mg esketamine (day 1, starting dose, see \nTable 3). Subsequent doses should be increased in increments of 28 mg up to 56 mg or 84 mg, based \non efficacy and tolerability.\n\nTable 3: Recommended Dosing for Spravato in Adults of Japanese Ancestry\nInduction phase Maintenance phase\nWeeks 1-4:\nStarting day 1 dose: 28 mg\nSubsequent doses: 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg \n\ntwice a week, all dose \nchanges should be in 28 mg \nincrements\n\nWeeks 5-8:\n28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg once weekly, all \ndose changes should be in 28 mg increments\n\nFrom week 9:\n28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg every 2 weeks or\nonce weekly, all dose changes should be in \n28 mg increments\n\nEvidence of therapeutic benefit should be evaluated \nat the end of induction phase to determine need for \ncontinued treatment.\n\nThe need for continued treatment should be \nreexamined periodically. \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Spravato in paediatric patients aged 17 years and younger have not been \nestablished. No data are available. There is no relevant use of Spravato in children less than 7 years of \nage in the indication for treatment-resistant depression.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nSpravato is for nasal use only. The nasal spray device is a single-use device that delivers a total of \n28 mg of esketamine, in two sprays (one spray per nostril). To prevent loss of medicinal product, the \ndevice should not be primed before use. It is intended for administration by the patient under the \nsupervision of a healthcare professional, using 1 device (for a 28 mg dose), 2 devices (for a 56 mg \ndose) or 3 devices (for an 84 mg dose), with a 5-minute rest between use of each device.\n\nSneezing after administration\nIf sneezing occurs immediately after administration, a replacement device should not be used. \n\nUse of the same nostril for 2 consecutive sprays\nIf administration in the same nostril occurs, a replacement device should not be used.\n\n\n\n5\n\nTreatment discontinuation with Spravato does not require tapering off; based on data from clinical \ntrials the risk of withdrawal symptoms is low.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\u25cf Hypersensitivity to the active substance, ketamine, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1\n\n\u25cf Patients for whom an increase in blood pressure or intracranial pressure poses a serious risk (see \nsection 4.8):\n- Patients with aneurysmal vascular disease (including intracranial, thoracic, or abdominal \n\naorta, or peripheral arterial vessels).\n- Patients with history of intracerebral haemorrhage.\n- Recent (within 6 weeks) cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nNeuropsychiatric and motor impairments\n\nSpravato has been reported to cause somnolence, sedation, dissociative symptoms, perception \ndisturbances, dizziness, vertigo and anxiety during the clinical trials (see section 4.8). These effects \nmay impair attention, judgment, thinking, reaction speed and motor skills. At each treatment session, \npatients should be monitored under the supervision of a healthcare professional to assess when the \npatient is considered stable based on clinical judgement (see section 4.7).\n\nRespiratory depression\n\nRespiratory depression may occur at high doses following rapid intravenous injection of esketamine or \nketamine when used for anaesthesia. No case of respiratory depression was observed in clinical trials \nwith esketamine nasal spray (Spravato); rare cases of deep sedation have been reported. Concomitant \nuse of Spravato with CNS depressants may increase the risk for sedation (see section 4.5). Close\nmonitoring is required for sedation and respiratory depression.\n\nEffect on blood pressure\n\nSpravato can cause transient increases in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure which peak at \napproximately 40 minutes after administration of the medicinal product and last approximately \n1-2 hours (see section 4.8). A substantial increase in blood pressure could occur after any treatment \nsession. Spravato is contraindicated in patients for whom an increase in blood pressure or intracranial\npressure poses a serious risk (see section 4.3). Before prescribing Spravato, patients with other \ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions should be carefully assessed to determine whether the \npotential benefits of Spravato outweigh its risks.\n\nIn patients whose blood pressure prior to dose administration is judged to be elevated (as a general \nguide: >140/90 mmHg for patients <65 years of age and >150/90 mmHg for patients \u226565 years of \nage), it is appropriate to adjust lifestyle and/or pharmacologic therapies to reduce blood pressure \nbefore starting treatment with Spravato. If blood pressure is elevated prior to Spravato administration a \ndecision to delay Spravato therapy should take into account the balance of benefit and risk in \nindividual patients.\n\nBlood pressure should be monitored after dose administration. Blood pressure should be measured \naround 40 minutes post-dose and subsequently as clinically warranted until values decline. If blood \npressure remains elevated for a prolonged period of time, assistance should promptly be sought from \npractitioners experienced in blood pressure management. Patients who experience symptoms of a \nhypertensive crisis should be referred immediately for emergency care.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPatients with clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular or respiratory conditions\n\nOnly initiate treatment with Spravato in patients with clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular\nor respiratory conditions if the benefit outweighs the risk. In these patients, Spravato should be \nadministered in a setting where appropriate resuscitation equipment and healthcare professionals with \ntraining in cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available. Examples of conditions which should be \nconsidered include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf Significant pulmonary insufficiency, including COPD;\n\u25cf Sleep apnoea with morbid obesity (BMI \u226535);\n\u25cf Patients with uncontrolled brady- or tachyarrhythmias that lead to haemodynamic instability;\n\u25cf Patients with a history of an MI. These patients should be clinically stable and cardiac symptom\n\nfree prior to administration;\n\u25cf Haemodynamically significant valvular heart disease or heart failure (NYHA Class III-IV).\n\nSuicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening\n\nDepression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide \n(suicide-related events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs, therefore, patients should\nbe closely monitored. It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early \nstages of recovery.\n\nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicide attempts and should receive careful monitoring during treatment.\n\nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany treatment \nespecially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should \nbe alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and \nunusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.\n\nDrug abuse, dependence, withdrawal\n\nIndividuals with a history of drug abuse or dependence may be at greater risk for abuse and misuse of\nSpravato. Prior to prescribing Spravato, each patient\u2019s risk for abuse or misuse should be assessed and \npatients receiving esketamine should be monitored for the development of behaviours or conditions of \nabuse or misuse, including drug seeking behaviour, while on therapy.\n\nDependence and tolerance have been reported with prolonged use of ketamine. In individuals who \nwere dependent on ketamine, withdrawal symptoms of cravings, anxiety, shaking, sweating and \npalpitations have been reported upon discontinuing ketamine.\n\nKetamine, the racemic mixture of arketamine and esketamine, is a medicinal product that has been \nreported to be abused. The potential for abuse, misuse and diversion of Spravato is minimised due to \nthe administration taking place under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional. Spravato \ncontains esketamine and may be subject to abuse and diversion.\n\nOther populations at risk\n\nSpravato should be used with caution in patients with the following conditions. These patients should \nbe carefully assessed before prescribing Spravato and treatment initiated only if the benefit outweighs \nthe risk:\n\u25cf Presence or history of psychosis;\n\u25cf Presence or history of mania or bipolar disorder;\n\u25cf Hyperthyroidism that has not been sufficiently treated;\n\u25cf History of brain injury, hypertensive encephalopathy, intrathecal therapy with ventricular \n\nshunts, or any other condition associated with increased intracranial pressure.\n\n\n\n7\n\nElderly (65 years of age and older)\n\nElderly patients treated with Spravato may have a greater risk of falling once mobilised, therefore, \nthese patients should be carefully monitored.\n\nSevere hepatic impairment\n\nDue to expected increase in exposure and lack of clinical experience, Spravato is not recommended in \npatients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment.\n\nHepatotoxicity has been reported with chronic ketamine use, therefore, the potential for such an effect \ndue to long-term use of Spravato cannot be excluded.\n\nUrinary tract symptoms\n\nUrinary tract and bladder symptoms have been reported with Spravato use (see section 4.8). It is \nrecommended to monitor for urinary tract and bladder symptoms during the course of treatment and \nrefer to an appropriate healthcare provider when symptoms persist.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nConcomitant use of Spravato with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol) may\nincrease sedation, which therefore should be closely monitored. \n\nBlood pressure should be closely monitored when Spravato is used concomitantly with \npsychostimulants (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate, modafanil, armodafinil) or other medicinal \nproducts that may increase blood pressure (e.g. xanthine derivatives, ergometrine, thyroid hormones, \nvasopressin, or MAOIs, such as, tranylcypromine, selegiline, phenelzine).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nSpravato is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited data on the use of esketamine in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown \nthat ketamine, the racemic mixture of arketamine and esketamine, induces neurotoxicity in developing \nfoetuses (see section 5.3). A similar risk with esketamine cannot be excluded.\n\nIf a woman becomes pregnant while being treated with Spravato, treatment should be discontinued,\nand the patient should be counselled about the potential risk to the foetus and clinical/therapeutic \noptions as soon as possible.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether esketamine is excreted in human milk. Data in animals have shown excretion of \nesketamine in milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether \nto discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Spravato therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies showed that fertility and reproductive capacities were not adversely affected by \nesketamine.\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSpravato has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In clinical studies, Spravato\nhas been reported to cause somnolence, sedation, dissociative symptoms, perception disturbances, \ndizziness, vertigo and anxiety (see section 4.8). Before Spravato administration, patients should be\ninstructed not to engage in potentially hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and \nmotor coordination, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery, until the next day following a \nrestful sleep (see section 4.4).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions in treatment-resistant depression patients treated with \nSpravato were dizziness (30%), nausea (27%), dissociation (26%), headache (24%), somnolence \n(18%), vertigo (18%), dysgeusia (17%), hypoaesthesia (11%), and vomiting (10%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions reported with esketamine are listed in the table below. Within the designated system \norgan classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency, using the following \nconvention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).\n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Drug Reaction\nFrequency\n\nVery common Common Uncommon\nPsychiatric disorders dissociation euphoric mood, agitation, \n\nanxiety, illusion, \nirritability, panic attack, \ntime perception altered,\nhallucination including \nvisual hallucination, \nderealisation\n\nNervous system disorders dizziness, headache,\ndysgeusia, somnolence,\nhypoaesthesia\n\nmental impairment, \ntremor, lethargy, \ndysarthria, paraesthesia, \nsedation\n\nEye disorders vision blurred \nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders\n\nvertigo hyperacusis,\ntinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders tachycardia\nVascular disorders hypertension\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nnasal discomfort, nasal \ndryness including nasal \ncrusting, nasal pruritus\n\nGastrointestinal disorders nausea, vomiting dry mouth, hypoaesthesia\noral\n\nsalivary \nhypersecretion\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nhyperhidrosis\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\npollakiuria, dysuria, \nmicturition urgency\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nfeeling abnormal, feeling \ndrunk, feeling of body \ntemperature change\n\n\n\n9\n\nInvestigations blood pressure increased\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nDissociation\nDissociation (26%) was one of the most common psychological effects of esketamine. Other related\nterms included derealisation (1.9%), depersonalisation (1.7%), illusions (1.5%), and distortion of time\n(1.2%). These adverse reactions were reported as transient and self-limited and occurred on the day of \ndosing. Dissociation was reported as severe in intensity at the incidence of less than 4% across studies. \nDissociation symptoms typically resolved by 1.5 hours post-dose and the severity tended to reduce \nover time with repeated treatments.\n\nSedation/somnolence\nAdverse reactions of sedation (9.1%) and somnolence (18.0%) were primarily mild or moderate in \nseverity, occurred on the day of dosing and resolved spontaneously the same day. Sedative effects\ntypically resolved by 1.5 hours post-dose. Rates of somnolence were relatively stable over time during \nlong-term treatment. In the cases of sedation, no symptoms of respiratory distress were observed, and \nhaemodynamic parameters (including vital signs and oxygen saturation) remained within normal \nranges.\n\nChanges in blood pressure\nIn clinical trials, increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) over time were \nabout 7 to 9 mmHg in SBP and 4 to 6 mmHg in DBP at 40 minutes post-dose and 2 to 5 mmHg in \nSBP and 1 to 3 mmHg in DBP at 1.5 hours post-dose in patients receiving Spravato plus oral\nantidepressants (see section 4.4). The frequency of markedly abnormal blood pressure elevations of \nSBP (\u226540 mmHg increase) ranged from 8% (<65 years) to 17% (\u226565 years) and DBP (\u226525 mmHg \nincrease) ranged from 13% (<65 years) to 14% (\u226565 years) in patients receiving esketamine plus oral \nantidepressant. The incidence of increased SBP (\u2265 180 mmHg) was 3% and DBP (\u2265 110 mmHg) was \n4%.\n\nCognitive and memory impairment\nCognitive and memory impairment have been reported with long-term ketamine use or drug abuse. \nThese effects did not increase over time and were reversible after discontinuing ketamine. In\nlong-term clinical trials, the effect of esketamine nasal spray on cognitive functioning was evaluated \nover time and performance remained stable.\n\nUrinary tract symptoms\nCases of interstitial cystitis have been reported with daily and long-term ketamine use at high doses. In \nclinical studies with esketamine, there were no cases of interstitial cystitis, however a higher rate of\nlower urinary tract symptoms was observed (pollakiuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and \ncystitis) in esketamine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe potential for overdose of Spravato by the patient is minimised due to the product\u2019s design and the \nadministration taking place under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 4.2).\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe maximum single esketamine nasal spray dose tested in healthy volunteers was 112 mg which \nshowed no evidence of toxicity and/or adverse clinical outcomes. However, compared to the \nrecommended dose range, the 112-mg esketamine nasal spray dose was associated with higher rates of \nadverse reactions, including dizziness, hyperhidrosis, somnolence, hypoaesthesia, feeling abnormal, \nnausea and vomiting.\n\nLife-threatening symptoms are expected based on experience with ketamine given at 25-fold the usual \nanaesthetic dose. Clinical symptoms are described as convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory \narrest. Administration of a comparable supratherapeutic dose of esketamine by the intranasal route is \nunlikely to be feasible.\n\nManagement\n\nThere is no specific antidote for esketamine overdose. In the case of overdose, the possibility of \nmultiple medicinal products involvement should be considered. Management of Spravato overdose \nshould consist of treating clinical symptoms and relevant monitoring. Close supervision and \nmonitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other antidepressants, ATC code: N06AX27.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nEsketamine is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine. It is a non-selective, non-competitive, antagonist \nof the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. Through NMDA \nreceptor antagonism, esketamine produces a transient increase in glutamate release leading to \nincreases in \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) stimulation \nand subsequently to increases in neurotrophic signalling which may contribute to the restoration of \nsynaptic function in these brain regions involved with the regulation of mood and emotional \nbehaviour. Restoration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in brain regions involved in the reward and \nmotivation, and decreased stimulation of brain regions involved in anhedonia, may contribute to the \nrapid response.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nAbuse potential\nIn a study of abuse potential conducted in recreational polydrug users (n=41), single doses of \nesketamine nasal spray (84 mg and 112 mg) and the positive control drug intravenous ketamine \n(0.5 mg/kg infused over 40 minutes) produced significantly greater scores than placebo on subjective \nratings of \u201cdrug liking\u201d and on other measures of subjective drug effects.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Spravato nasal spray was investigated in five Phase 3 clinical studies in \nadult patients (18 to 86 years) with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who met DSM-5 criteria for \nmajor depressive disorder and were non-responders to at least two oral antidepressants (ADs) \ntreatments, of adequate dosage and duration, in the current major depressive episode. 1,833 adult\npatients were enrolled, of which 1,601 patients were exposed to Spravato.\n\n\n\n11\n\nTreatment-resistant depression \u2013 Short-term studies\n\nSpravato was evaluated in three Phase 3 short-term (4-week) randomised, double-blind, \nactive-controlled studies in patients with TRD. Studies TRANSFORM-1 (TRD3001) and \nTRANSFORM-2 (TRD3002) were conducted in adults (18 to < 65 years) and Study TRANSFORM-3 \n(TRD3005) was conducted in adults \u2265 65 years of age. Patients in TRD3001 and TRD3002 initiated \ntreatment with Spravato 56 mg plus a newly initiated daily oral AD or a newly initiated daily oral AD \nplus placebo nasal spray on day 1. Spravato dosages were then maintained on 56 mg or titrated to \n84 mg or matching placebo nasal spray administered twice-weekly during a 4-week double-blind \ninduction phase. Spravato doses of 56 mg or 84 mg were fixed in Study TRD3001 and flexible in\nStudy TRD3002. In Study TRD3005, patients (\u2265 65 years) initiated treatment with Spravato 28 mg \nplus a newly initiated daily oral AD or a newly initiated daily oral AD plus placebo nasal spray \n(day 1). Spravato dosages were titrated to 56 mg or 84 mg or matching placebo nasal spray \nadministered twice-weekly during a 4-week double-blind induction phase. In the flexible dose studies, \nTRD3002 and TRD3005, up titration of Spravato dose was based on clinical judgement and dose \ncould be down titrated based on tolerability. A newly initiated open-label oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, \nvenlafaxine extended release; SSRI: escitalopram, sertraline) was initiated on day 1 in all studies. The \nselection of the newly initiated oral AD was determined by the investigator based on the patient\u2019s prior \ntreatment history.

In study TRD3002, esketamine plus a newly initiated oral AD demonstrated clinically \nmeaningful and statistical superiority compared to a newly initiated oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, \nvenlafaxine extended release; SSRI: escitalopram, sertraline) plus placebo nasal spray (Table 5), and \nsymptom reduction was observed as early as 24 hours post-dose.\n\nIn study TRD3001, a clinically meaningful treatment effect in change in MADRS total scores from \nbaseline at the end of the 4-week induction phase was observed favouring Spravato plus newly \ninitiated oral AD compared with a newly initiated oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, venlafaxine extended \nrelease; SSRI: escitalopram, sertraline) plus placebo nasal spray (Table 5).

Study \nSUSTAIN-1 (TRD3003) was a long-term randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, \nmulticenter, relapse prevention study. The primary outcome measure to assess the prevention of \ndepressive relapse was measured as time to relapse. Overall a total of 705 patients were enrolled; 437\ndirectly enrolled; 150 transferred from TRD3001, and 118 transferred from TRD3002. Patients \ndirectly enrolled were administered Spravato (56 mg or 84 mg twice weekly) plus oral AD in a 4-week \nopen label induction phase. At the end of the open label induction phase, 52% of patients were in \nremission (MADRS total score \u2264 12) and 66% of patients were responders (\u2265 50% improvement in \nMADRS total score). Patients who were responders (455), continued receiving treatment with \nSpravato plus oral AD in a 12-week optimisation phase. After the induction phase, patients received \nSpravato weekly for 4 weeks and starting from week 8, an algorithm (based on the MADRS) was used \nto determine the dosing frequency; patients in remission (i.e., MADRS total score was \u2264 12) were \ndosed every other week, however, if the MADRS total score increased to > 12, then the frequency was \nincreased to weekly dosing for the next 4 weeks; with the objective of maintaining the patient on the \nlowest dosing frequency to maintain response/remission. At the end of 16 weeks of treatment period, \npatients in stable remission (n=176) or stable response (n=121) were randomised to continue with \nSpravato or stop Spravato and switch to placebo nasal spray. Stable remission was defined as MADRS\n\n\n\n14\n\ntotal score \u2264 12 in at least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the optimisation phase and stable response was \ndefined as \u2265 50% reduction in the MADRS total score from baseline for the last 2 weeks of the \noptimisation phase, but not in stable remission.\n\nStable remission\n\nPatients in stable remission who continued treatment with Spravato plus oral AD experienced a \nstatistically significantly longer time to relapse of depressive symptoms than did patients on a newly \ninitiated oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, venlafaxine extended release; SSRI: escitalopram, sertraline) plus \nplacebo nasal spray (Figure 1). Relapse was defined as a MADRS total score \u2265 22 for 2 consecutive \nweeks or hospitalisation for worsening depression or any other clinically relevant event indicative of \nrelapse. The median time to relapse for a newly initiated oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, venlafaxine \nextended release; SSRI: escitalopram, sertraline) plus placebo nasal spray group was 273 days, \nwhereas the median was not estimable for Spravato plus oral AD, as this group never reached 50% \nrelapse rate.\n\nFigure 1: Time to relapse in patients in stable remission in study TRD3003 (full analysis set)\n\nFor patients in stable remission, the relapse rate based on Kaplan-Meier estimates during the 12- and \n24-weeks double-blind follow up period was 13% and 32% for Spravato and 37% and 46% for \nplacebo nasal spray, respectively.\n\nStable response\n\nThe efficacy results were also consistent for patients in stable response who continued treatment with \nSpravato plus oral AD; patients experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of \ndepressive symptoms than did patients on a newly initiated oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, venlafaxine \nextended release; SSRI: escitalopram, sertraline) plus placebo nasal spray (Figure 2). The median time \nto relapse for a newly initiated oral AD (SNRI: duloxetine, venlafaxine extended release; SSRI: \nescitalopram, sertraline) plus placebo nasal spray group (88 days) was shorter compared to Spravato\nplus oral AD group (635 days).\n\n\n\n15\n\nFigure 2: Time to relapse in patients in stable response in study TRD3003 (full analysis set)\n\nFor patients in stable response, the relapse rate based on Kaplan-Meier estimates during the 12- and \n24-weeks double-blind follow up period was 21% and 21% for Spravato and 47% and 56% for \nplacebo nasal spray, respectively.\n\nEnrollment in TRD3003 was staggered over approximately 2 years. The maintenance phase was of \nvariable duration and continued until the individual patient had a relapse of depressive symptoms or\ndiscontinued for any other reason, or the study ended because the required number of relapse events \noccurred. Exposure numbers were influenced by the study stopping at a pre-determined number of \nrelapses based on the interim analysis. After an initial 16 weeks of treatment with Spravato plus oral \nAD, the median duration of exposure to Spravato in the maintenance phase was 4.2 months (range: \n1 day to 21.2 months) in Spravato -treated patients (stable remission and stable response). In this \nstudy, 31.6% of patients received Spravato for greater than 6 months and 7.9% of patients received \nSpravato for greater than 1 year in the maintenance phase.\n\nDosing frequency\n\nThe dosing frequency used the majority of the time during the maintenance phase is shown in Table 7. \nOf the patients randomised to Spravato, 60% received 84 mg and 40% received 56 mg dose.\n\nTable 7: Dosing frequency used the majority of the time; maintenance phase (Study \nTRD3003)\n\nStable Remission Stable Responders\n\nSpravato + \nOral AD\n(N=90)\n\nOral AD + \nPlacebo Nasal \n\nSpray\n(N=86)\n\nSpravato + \nOral AD\n(N=62)\n\nOral AD + \nPlacebo Nasal \n\nSpray\n(N=59)\n\nMajority dosing frequency\nWeekly 21 (23.3%) 27 (31.4%) 34 (54.8%) 36 (61.0%)\n\n\n\n16\n\nEvery other week 62 (68.9%) 48 (55.8%) 21 (33.9%) 19 (32.2%)\nWeekly or every other week 7 (7.8%) 11 (12.8%) 7 (11.3%) 4 (6.8%)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSpravato in the treatment of major depressive disorder in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of 84 mg esketamine administered as a nasal spray is approximately \n48%.\n\nEsketamine is rapidly absorbed by the nasal mucosa following nasal administration and can be \nmeasured in plasma within 7 minutes following a 28 mg dose. The time to reach maximum plasma \nconcentration (tmax) is typically 20 to 40 minutes after the last nasal spray of a treatment session (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nDose-dependent increases in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC\u221e) of esketamine nasal spray were produced by doses of 28 mg, 56 mg \nand 84 mg.\n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of esketamine is similar after a single dose and repeat dose administration \nwith no accumulation in plasma when esketamine is administered twice a week.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe mean steady-state volume of distribution of esketamine administered by the intravenous route is \n709 L.\n\nThe proportion of the total concentration of esketamine that is bound to proteins in human plasma is \non average 43 to 45%. The degree to which esketamine is bound to plasma proteins is not dependent \non hepatic or renal function.\n\nEsketamine is not a substrate of transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp; multidrug resistance protein 1), \nbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), or organic anion transporter (OATP) 1B1, or OATP1B3. \nEsketamine does not inhibit these transporters or multi-drug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) and \nMATE2-K, or organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), OAT1, or OAT3.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nEsketamine is extensively metabolised in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway of esketamine in \nhuman liver microsomes is N-demethylation to form noresketamine. The main cytochrome P450 \n(CYP) enzymes responsible for esketamine N-demethylation are CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Other CYP \nenzymes, including CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, contribute to a much smaller extent. Noresketamine is \nsubsequently metabolised via CYP-dependent pathways to other metabolites, some of which undergo \nglucuronidation.\n\nElimination\n\nThe mean clearance of esketamine administered by the intravenous route was approximately \n89 L/hour. After Cmax was reached following nasal administration, the decline in esketamine \nconcentrations in plasma was rapid for the first few hours and then more gradual. The mean terminal \nhalf-life following administration as a nasal spray generally ranged from 7 to 12 hours.\n\n\n\n17\n\nFollowing intravenous administration of radiolabelled esketamine, approximately 78% and 2% of \nadministered radioactivity was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. Following oral \nadministration of radiolabelled esketamine, approximately 86% and 2% of administered radioactivity \nwas recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. The recovered radioactivity consisted primarily of \nesketamine metabolites. For the intravenous and oral routes of administration, < 1% of the dose was \nexcreted in the urine as unchanged drug.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nEsketamine exposure increases with dose from 28 mg to 84 mg. The increase in Cmax and AUC values \nwas less than dose-proportional between 28 mg and 56 mg or 84 mg, but it was nearly dose \nproportional between 56 mg and 84 mg.\n\nInteractions\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on esketamine\n\nHepatic enzyme inhibitors\nPre-treatment of healthy subjects with oral ticlopidine, an inhibitor of hepatic CYP2B6 activity, \n(250 mg twice daily for 9 days prior to and on the day of esketamine administration) had no effect on \nthe Cmax of esketamine administered as a nasal spray. The AUC\u221e of esketamine was increased by \napproximately 29%. The terminal half-life of esketamine was not affected by ticlopidine \npre-treatment.\n\nPre-treatment with oral clarithromycin, an inhibitor of hepatic CYP3A4 activity, (500 mg twice daily \nfor 3 days prior to and on the day of esketamine administration) increase the mean Cmax and AUC\u221e of \nnasally administered esketamine by approximately 11% and 4%, respectively. The terminal half-life of \nesketamine was not affected by clarithromycin pre-treatment.\n\nHepatic enzyme inducers\nPre-treatment with oral rifampicin, a potent inducer of the activity of multiple hepatic CYP enzymes \nsuch as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, (600 mg daily for 5 days prior to esketamine administration) \ndecreased the mean Cmax and AUC\u221e values of esketamine administered as a nasal spray by \napproximately 17% and 28%, respectively.\n\nOther nasal spray products\nPre-treatment of subjects with a history of allergic rhinitis and pre-exposed to grass pollen with \noxymetazoline administered as a nasal spray (2 sprays of 0.05% solution administered at 1 hour prior \nto nasal administration of esketamine) had minor effects on the pharmacokinetics of esketamine.\n\nPre-treatment of healthy subjects with nasal administration of mometasone furoate (200 mcg per day \nfor 2 weeks with the last mometasone furoate dose administered at 1 hour prior to nasal administration \nof esketamine) had minor effects on the pharmacokinetics of esketamine.\n\nEffect of esketamine on other medicinal products\n\nNasal administration of 84 mg esketamine twice a week for 2 weeks reduced the mean plasma AUC\u221e\nof oral midazolam (single 6 mg dose), a substrate of hepatic CYP3A4, by approximately 16%.\n\nNasal administration of 84 mg esketamine twice a week for 2 weeks did not affect the mean plasma \nAUC of oral bupropion (single 150 mg dose), a substrate of hepatic CYP2B6.\n\n\n\n18\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (65 years of age and older)\nThe pharmacokinetics of esketamine administered as a nasal spray was compared between elderly but \notherwise healthy subjects and younger healthy adults. The mean esketamine Cmax and AUC\u221e values \nproduced by a 28-mg dose were 21% and 18% higher, respectively, in elderly subjects (age range 65\nto 81 years) compared with younger adult subjects (age range 22 to 50 years). The mean esketamine \nCmax and AUC\u221e values produced by an 84-mg dose were 67% and 38% higher in elderly subjects (age \nrange 75 to 85 years) compared with younger adult subjects (age range 24 to 54 years). The terminal \nhalf-life of esketamine was similar in the elderly and younger adult subjects (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nRelative to the subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CLCR], 88 to 140 mL/min), \nthe Cmax of esketamine was on average 20 to 26% higher in subjects with mild (CLCR, 58 to \n77 mL/min), moderate (CLCR, 30 to 47 mL/min), or severe (CLCR, 5 to 28 mL/min, not on dialysis) \nrenal impairment following administration of a 28-mg dose of esketamine nasal spray. The AUC\u221e was \n13 to 36% higher in the subjects with mild to severe renal impairment.\n\nThere is no clinical experience with esketamine administered as a nasal spray in patients on dialysis.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe Cmax and AUC\u221e of esketamine produced by a 28-mg doses were similar between subjects with \nChild-Pugh class A (mild) hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC\u221e of \nesketamine were 8% higher and 103% higher, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class B \n(moderate) hepatic impairment, relative to healthy subjects.\n\nThere is no clinical experience with esketamine administered as a nasal spray in patients with \nChild-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nRace\nThe pharmacokinetics of esketamine nasal spray was compared between healthy Asian subjects and \nCaucasian subjects. Mean plasma esketamine Cmax and AUC\u221e values produced by a single, 56-mg \ndose of esketamine were approximately 14% and 33% higher, respectively, in Chinese subjects \ncompared to Caucasians. Both parameters were approximately 40% higher in Japanese subjects, \nrelative to Caucasian subjects. On average, esketamine Cmax was 10% lower and AUC\u221e was 17% \nhigher in Korean subjects, relative to Caucasian subjects. The mean terminal half-life of esketamine in \nthe plasma of Asian subjects ranged from 7.1 to 8.9 hours and was 6.8 hours in Caucasian subjects.\n\nGender and body weight\nNo significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of esketamine nasal spray were observed for gender \nand total body weight (> 39 to 170 kg) based on population PK analysis. \n\nAllergic rhinitis\nThe pharmacokinetics of a single, 56-mg dose of esketamine administered as a nasal spray was similar \nin subjects with allergic rhinitis who were exposed to grass pollen compared to healthy subjects.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenic potential. Animal studies \nwith ketamine showed evidence of developmental neurotoxicity. The potential for esketamine to have \nneurotoxic effects on developing foetuses cannot be excluded (see section 4.6).\n\nGenotoxicity\n\nEsketamine was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test. Genotoxic \neffects with esketamine were seen in a screening in vitro micronucleus test in the presence of \n\n\n\n19\n\nmetabolic activation. However, intravenously-administered esketamine was devoid of genotoxic \nproperties in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in rats and an in vivo Comet assay in rat liver \ncells.\n\nReproductive toxicity\n\nIn an embryo foetal developmental toxicity study with nasally administered ketamine in rats, the\noffspring was not adversely affected in the presence of maternal toxicity at doses resulting in exposure \nup to 6-fold higher than human exposure, based on AUC values. In an embryo foetal developmental \ntoxicity study with nasally administered ketamine in rabbits, skeletal malformations were observed\nand foetal body weight was reduced at maternally toxic doses. Exposure in rabbits was in the region of \nhuman exposure based on AUC values.\n\nPublished studies in animals (including primates) at doses resulting in light to moderate anaesthesia \ndemonstrate that the use of anaesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or \nsynaptogenesis results in cell loss in the developing brain, that can be associated with prolonged \ncognitive deficiencies. The clinical significance of these non-clinical findings in not known.\n\n6.
