NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSANCUSO 3.1 mg/24 hours transdermal patch \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach 52 cm2 transdermal patch contains 34.3 mg of granisetron releasing 3.1 mg of granisetron per \n24 hours. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch. \n \nThin, translucent, matrix-type, rectangular-shaped transdermal patch with rounded corners. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSANCUSO transdermal patch is indicated in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting \nassociated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, for a planned duration of \n3 to 5 consecutive days, where oral anti-emetic administration is complicated by factors making \nswallowing difficult (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults \nApply a single transdermal patch 24 to 48 hours before chemotherapy, as appropriate. \n \nDue to a gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application of the transdermal \npatch, a slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron may be observed at the start of \nchemotherapy; the patch should be applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy. \n \nThe transdermal patch should be removed a minimum of 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy. \nThe transdermal patch can be worn for up to 7 days depending on the duration of the chemotherapy \nregimen. \n \nFollowing routine haematological monitoring, the transdermal patch should only be applied to patients \nwhose chemotherapy treatment is unlikely to be delayed in order to reduce the possibility of \nunnecessary exposure to granisetron. \n \nUse of concomitant corticosteroids \nThe Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) guidelines recommend the \nadministration of dexamethasone with 5HT3 antagonist prior to chemotherapy. In the pivotal \nSANCUSO study, the concomitant use of corticosteroids, e.g. dexamethasone, was permitted provided \nit was part of the chemotherapy regimen. Any increase in corticosteroid use during the study was \nreported as rescue treatment. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \nElderly \nDosing as for adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary. Dosing as for adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Although no evidence \nof an increased incidence of adverse reactions have been observed in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment receiving granisetron orally and intravenously, based on granisetron pharmacokinetics, a \ndegree of caution must be exercised in this population. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of SANCUSO in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe transdermal patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the outer part of the upper \narm. If it is not possible to apply the transdermal patch to the arm, it can be applied to the abdomen. \n \nThe transdermal patch should not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged. \n \nEach transdermal patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been \nopened. The release liner is removed prior to application. \n \nThe transdermal patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \nIn the event of a transdermal patch becoming completely or partially detached, the original transdermal \npatch should be reattached in the same position using medical tape (if necessary). If reattachment is not \npossible or the transdermal patch is damaged, a new transdermal patch should be applied in the same \nposition as the original transdermal patch. If this is not possible, a new transdermal patch should be \napplied on the opposite arm. The newly applied transdermal patch should be removed in line with the \ntiming recommended above. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nApplication site reactions \nIn clinical trials with SANCUSO, application site reactions were reported which were generally mild \nin intensity and did not lead to discontinuation of use. If severe reactions, or a generalised skin reaction \noccur (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or pruritus), the transdermal \npatch must be removed. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nAs granisetron may reduce lower bowel motility, patients with signs of sub-acute intestinal obstruction \nshould be monitored following its administration. \n \nCardiac disorders \n5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as granisetron, may be associated with arrhythmias or ECG \nabnormalities. This potentially may have clinical significance in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias \nor cardiac conduction disorders or patients who are being treated with antiarrhythmics or beta-- \nblockers. No clinically relevant effects have been observed in clinical studies with SANCUSO. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nExposure to sunlight \nGranisetron may be affected by direct natural or artificial sunlight, see section 5.3 for further \ninformation. Patients must be advised to cover the transdermal patch application site, e.g. with \nclothing, if there is a risk of exposure to sunlight throughout the period of wear and for 10 days \nfollowing its removal. \n \nShowering or washing \nShowering or washing normally can be continued while wearing SANCUSO. Activities such as \nswimming, strenuous exercise or using a sauna should be avoided. \n \nExternal heat \nExternal heat (for example hot water bottles or heat pads) should be avoided on the area of the \ntransdermal patch. \n \nSpecial populations \nNo dose adjustments are necessary for the elderly or patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \nAlthough no evidence of an increased incidence of adverse reactions have been observed in patients \nwith renal or hepatic impairment receiving granisetron orally and intravenously, based on granisetron \npharmacokinetics, a degree of caution must be exercised in this population. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome with the use of 5-HT3 antagonists either alone, but \nmostly in combination with other serotonergic medicinal products (including selective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Appropriate \nobservation of patients for serotonin syndrome-like symptoms is advised. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFor serotonergic medicinal products (e.g. SSRIs and SNRIs), there have been reports of serotonin \nsyndrome following concomitant use of 5-HT3 antagonists and other serotonergic medicinal products \n(including SSRIs and SNRIs). \n \nCo-administration of intravenous 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with oral paracetamol in human subjects \nhas been reported to result in a block in the analgesic effect via a pharmacodynamic mechanism. \n \nAs granisetron is metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 active substance-metabolising enzymes \n(CYP1A1 and CYP3A4), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, \nhence, the half-life of granisetron. \n \nIn human subjects, hepatic enzyme induction by phenobarbital has led to an increase in total plasma \nclearance (approximately 25%) following intravenous administration of granisetron. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of granisetron via the \ncytochrome P450 3A isoenzyme family. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \nIn vitro studies using human microsomes indicate that granisetron neither stimulates nor inhibits the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme system. \n \nIn studies in healthy subjects, no evidence of any interaction has been indicated between granisetron \nand benzodiazepines (lorazepam), neuroleptics (haloperidol) or anti-ulcer medicinal products \n(cimetidine). \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions between SANCUSO and emetogenic cancer chemotherapies have \nbeen seen. Furthermore, no interaction has been observed between granisetron and emetogenic cancer \ntherapies. In agreement with these data, no clinically relevant interactions have been reported in \nclinical studies with SANCUSO. In clinical interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically \nimportant effects on the pharmacokinetics of granisetron. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of granisetron in \npregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nSANCUSO during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether granisetron or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding \nshould be discontinued during treatment with SANCUSO. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of granisetron on human fertility. Fertility was unaffected following \ngranisetron treatment in rats. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSANCUSO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety profile of SANCUSO is derived from controlled clinical trials and from post-marketing \nexperience. The most commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical studies was constipation, \noccurring in approximately 8.7% of patients. The majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate \nin severity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions from clinical studies and spontaneous reports with SANCUSO are listed in the table \nbelow. \n \nWithin the system organ class, the adverse reactions are listed by frequency using the following \nconvention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nAdverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness within each frequency grouping. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported for SANCUSO \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency \nImmune system disorder Hypersensitivity reactions Not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite Uncommon \nNervous system disorders Headache Uncommon \n Dystonia Rare \n Dyskinesia Rare \nEar and labyrinth disorders Vertigo Uncommon \nVascular disorders Flushing Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Constipation Common \n\nDry mouth, nausea, retching Uncommon \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase \nincreased, aspartate \naminotransferase increased, \ngamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \n\nUncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nApplication site irritation \nApplication site reactions \n(application site pain, \napplication site pruritus, \napplication site erythema, \napplication site rash, \napplication site irritation) * \n\nUncommon \nNot known \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nArthralgia Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nGeneralised oedema Uncommon \n\n*Spontaneous reports \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPatients who are being treated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy may still \nexperience vomiting despite treatment with antiemetic therapy, including SANCUSO. \n \nClass effects \nClass effects for granisetron seen with other formulations (oral and intravenous) include the following: \n \n- Hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria \n- Insomnia \n- Headache \n- Extrapyramidal reactions \n- Somnolence \n- Dizziness \n- QT prolongation \n- Constipation \n- Diarrhoea \n- Elevated hepatic transaminases \n- Rash \n- Asthenia \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for granisetron. In the event of overdose, the transdermal patch should be \nremoved. Symptomatic treatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, serotonin (5HT3) antagonists, ATC \ncode: A04AA02. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nGranisetron is a potent anti-emetic and highly selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT3 \nreceptors). Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that granisetron is effective against nausea and \nvomiting as a result of cytostatic therapy. Radioligand binding studies have demonstrated that \ngranisetron has negligible affinity for other receptor types, including 5HT1, 5HT2, 5HT4 and dopamine \nD2 binding sites. \n \nA pivotal, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multinational Phase III study compared the \nefficacy, tolerability and safety of SANCUSO with that of 2 mg oral granisetron once daily in the \nprevention of nausea and vomiting in a total of 641 patients receiving multi-day chemotherapy. The \nstudy was designed to show non-inferiority of SANCUSO to oral granisetron. \n \nThe population randomised into the trial included 48% males and 52% females aged 16 to 86 years \nreceiving moderately emetogenic (ME) or highly emetogenic (HE) multi-day chemotherapy. 78% of \npatients were white, with 12% Asian and 10% Hispanic/Latino. \n \nThe granisetron transdermal patch was applied 24 to 48 hours prior to the first dose of chemotherapy, \nand kept in place for 7 days. Oral granisetron was administered daily for the duration of the \nchemotherapy regimen, one hour prior to each dose of chemotherapy. Anti-emetic activity was \nassessed from the first administration until 24 hours after the start of the last day\u2019s administration of \nthe ME or HE chemotherapy regimen. \n \nNon-inferiority of SANCUSO versus oral granisetron was confirmed, with complete control (CC) \nachieved in 60.2% of patients in the SANCUSO arm and 64.8% of patients receiving oral granisetron \nin the per protocol set (difference -4.89%; 95% confidence interval \u201312.91% to +3.13%; n=284 \ntransdermal patch, n=298 oral). CC was defined as no vomiting and/or retching, no more than mild \nnausea and no rescue medicine from the first administration until 24 hours after the start of the last \nday\u2019s administration of multi-day chemotherapy. \n \nDue to the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application of the transdermal \npatch, initial plasma levels at the start of chemotherapy may be lower than 2 mg oral granisetron and a \nslower onset of efficacy may therefore be observed. Consequently, SANCUSO is indicated for use in \npatients where oral anti-emetic administration is complicated by factors making swallowing difficult. \n \nComplete control by day is illustrated below. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n \nIn clinical trials with SANCUSO, there were no treatment-related effects on heart rate or blood \npressure. Assessment of serial ECGs in patients showed no QT prolongation and no change in ECG \nmorphology. The effect of SANCUSO on QTc interval was specifically evaluated in a blinded, \nrandomised, parallel, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled thorough QTc trial with \nSANCUSO in 240 adult male and female subjects. No significant effect on QTc prolongation was \nobserved for SANCUSO. \n \nAn assessment of transdermal patch adhesion in 621 patients receiving either active or placebo \ntransdermal patches showed that less than 1% of transdermal patches became detached over the course \nof the 7 day period of transdermal patch application. \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience with SANCUSO and patients on chemotherapy for less than \n3 consecutive days, or over multiple cycles of chemotherapy, or with high-dose chemotherapy prior to \nstem-cell transplantation. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nGranisetron crosses intact skin into the systemic circulation by a passive diffusion process. Following \nSANCUSO application, granisetron is absorbed slowly, with maximal concentrations reached between \n24 and 48 hours. \n \nBased on the measure of residual content of the transdermal patch after removal, approximately 65% \nof granisetron is delivered resulting in an average daily dose of 3.1 mg per day. \n \nConcurrent administration of a single intravenous bolus of 0.01 mg/kg (maximum 1 mg) granisetron at \nthe same time a SANCUSO transdermal patch was applied was investigated in healthy subjects. An \ninitial peak in plasma concentrations of granisetron, attributable to the intravenous dose, was reached at \n10 minutes post-administration. The known pharmacokinetic profile of the transdermal patch over the \nperiod of wear (7 days) was not affected. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nFollowing consecutive application of two SANCUSO transdermal patches in healthy subjects, each for \nseven days, granisetron levels were maintained over the study period with evidence of minimal \naccumulation. \n \nIn a study designed to assess the effect of heat on the transdermal delivery of granisetron from \nSANCUSO in healthy subjects, a heat pad generating an average temperature of 42\u00b0C was applied over \nthe transdermal patch for 4 hours each day over the 5 day period of wear. While application of the heat \npad was associated with a minor and transient increase in the transdermal patch flux during the period \nof heat pad application, no overall increase in granisetron exposure was observed when compared to a \ncontrol group. \n \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, where SANCUSO was applied for a period of \n7 days, mean total exposure (AUC0-infinity) was 416 ng h/ml (range 55 \u2013 1192 ng h/ml), with a between \nsubject variability of 89%. Mean Cmax was 3.9 ng/ml (range 0.7 \u2013 9.5 ng/ml), with a between subject \nvariability of 77%. This variability is similar to the known high variability in granisetron \npharmacokinetics after oral or intravenous administration. \n \nDistribution \nGranisetron is distributed with a mean volume of distribution of approximately 3 l/kg. Plasma protein \nbinding is approximately 65%. Granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells. \n \nBiotransformation \nNo differences in the metabolic profiles of granisetron were observed between the oral and transdermal \nuses. \n \nGranisetron is mainly metabolised to 7-hydroxygranisetron and 9\u2019N-desmethylgranisetron. In vitro \nstudies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP1A1 is the major enzyme responsible for the \n7-hydroxylation of granisetron, whereas CYP3A4 contributes to 9\u2019desmethylation. \n \nElimination \nGranisetron is cleared primarily by hepatic metabolism. After intravenous dosing, the mean plasma \nclearance ranged from 33.4 to 75.7 l/h in healthy subjects and from 14.7 to 33.6 l/h in patients with \nwide inter-subject variability. The mean plasma half-life in healthy subjects is 4-6 hours and in patients \nis 9-12 hours. After transdermal patch application, the apparent granisetron plasma half-life in healthy \nsubjects was prolonged to approximately 36 hours due to the slow absorption rate of granisetron \nthrough the skin. \n \nIn clinical studies conducted with SANCUSO, clearance in cancer patients was shown to be \napproximately half that of healthy subjects. \n \nAfter intravenous injection, approximately 12% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine of \nhealthy subjects in 48 hours. The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites, with 49% in the \nurine and 34% in the faeces. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nThe effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO have not been specifically studied. No \nconsistent gender effects on pharmacokinetics were observed in clinical studies with SANCUSO, with \na large inter-individual variability reported in both sexes. Population PK modelling has confirmed the \nabsence of a gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO. \n \nElderly \nIn a clinical study no differences were seen in the plasma pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO in male and \nfemale elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) compared with younger subjects (aged 18-45 years inclusive). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo clinical studies have been performed specifically to investigate the pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO \nin patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No clear relationship between renal function (as measured \nby creatinine clearance) and granisetron clearance was identified in population PK modelling. In \npatients with renal failure or hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of granisetron were determined \nfollowing a single 40 \u00b5g/kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement, total plasma clearance was \napproximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment. Given the wide variability in \npharmacokinetic parameters of granisetron and the good tolerance well above the recommended dose, \ndose adjustment in patients with functional hepatic impairment is not necessary. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo correlation between creatinine clearance and total clearance was observed in cancer patients, \nindicating no influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of granisetron. \n \nBody Mass Index (BMI) \nIn a clinical study designed to assess granisetron exposure from SANCUSO in subjects with differing \nlevels of body fat, using BMI as a surrogate measure for body fat, no differences were seen in the \nplasma pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO in male and female subjects with a low BMI [<19.5 kg/m2 \n(males), <18.5 kg/m2 (females)] and a high BMI (30.0 to 39.9 kg/m2 inclusive) compared to a control \ngroup (BMI 20.0 to 24.9 kg/m2inclusive). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere are limited data available in patients <18 years of age. No studies have been performed to \ninvestigate the pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO in paediatric patients <13 years of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data did not reveal any special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies \nshowed no special hazard for humans when used at the recommended dose. However, when \nadministered in higher doses and over a prolonged period of time, the risk of carcinogenicity cannot be \nruled out but with the short application period recommended for the transdermal delivery system, a \ncarcinogenic risk for humans is not expected. \n \nSANCUSO transdermal patches did not show any potential for photoirritation or photosensitivity when \ntested in vivo in guinea-pigs. Granisetron was not phototoxic when tested in vitro in a mouse fibroblast \ncell line. When tested for potential photogenotoxicity in vitro in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nline, granisetron increased the percentage of cells with chromosome damage following \nphotoirradiation. Although, the clinical relevance of this finding is not completely clear, patients \nshould be advised to cover the transdermal patch application site if there is a risk of exposure to \nsunlight throughout the period of wear and for 10 days following its removal (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen tested for skin sensitising potential in guinea pigs, SANCUSO showed a low potential for \nirritancy. \n \nA study in cloned human cardiac ion channels has shown that granisetron has the potential to affect \ncardiac repolarisation via blockade of hERG potassium channels. Granisetron has been shown to block \nboth sodium and potassium channels, which could affect cardiac depolarisation and repolarisation and \ntherefore PR, QRS, and QT intervals. These data help to clarify the mechanisms by which some of the \nECG changes (particularly QT and QRS prolongation) associated with this class of substance can \noccur. However, no clinically relevant effects on ECG have been observed in clinical studies with \nSANCUSO, including a through QT study in 240 healthy subjects (section 5.1). \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.

What SANCUSO is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in SANCUSO is granisetron, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nantiemetics and antinauseants. \n \nSANCUSO is a transdermal (skin) patch used to prevent nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being \nsick) in adults receiving chemotherapy treatments (medicines to treat cancer) lasting 3 to 5 days and \nwho have difficulty swallowing tablets (for example due to soreness, dryness or inflammation of the \nmouth or throat). \n \nYou must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after the first day of \nchemotherapy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use SANCUSO \n \nDo not use SANCUSO: \n- if you are allergic to granisetron or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are allergic to any other anti-sickness medicines whose name ends in \u201csetron\u201d e.g. \n\nondansetron. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTell your doctor or nurse before using this treatment if any of the following applies to you: \n \n- if you have been told you have a heart disorder or disease \n- if you have pain in your stomach or your stomach is swollen \n- if you have problems with your kidneys or liver. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nThis medicine may not work as well and/or may affect your skin if exposed to direct sunlight or the \nlight from sunlamps or tanning beds. It is important to do the following: \n- while you wear the transdermal patch, keep it covered with clothing if you will be in sunlight or \n\nnear a sunlamp, including tanning beds \n- keep the skin where this medicine was applied covered for another 10 days after the  transdermal \n\npatch is taken off to protect from exposure to direct sunlight. \n \nIt is not known how activities such as swimming, strenuous exercise or using a sauna or whirlpool, \nmay affect this medicine. Avoid these activities while wearing this transdermal patch. You can continue \nto shower and wash normally while wearing the transdermal patch. \n \nExternal heat, for example from hot water bottles or heat pads, should be avoided on the area of the \ntransdermal patch. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used by children or adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and SANCUSO \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nSANCUSO can affect the way some medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way \nSANCUSO works. In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking the following medicines: \n- Paracetamol, used to treat pain. \n- Phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy. \n- Ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections. \n- SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) used to treat depression and/or anxiety including \n fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram. \n- SNRIs (serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) used to treat depression and/or anxiety \n including venlafaxine, duloxetine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless your doctor has specifically recommended it. \n \nStop breast-feeding while wearing the patch. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSANCUSO has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive or use any machines. \n \n \n3. How to use SANCUSO \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or nurse if you \nare not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one single transdermal patch. The medicine in the transdermal patch passes \ngradually through your skin into your body and, therefore, the patch is applied 1 to 2 days (24 to \n48 hours) before the start of chemotherapy treatment. \n \nThis medicine is for transdermal use. This medicine delivers the active substance slowly and \nconstantly through your skin and into your blood stream for the duration that you are wearing the \ntransdermal patch. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nThings to remember when using the transdermal patch \n- Do not keep or store the transdermal patch outside the sealed sachet. \n- Do not cut the transdermal patch into smaller pieces. \n- Use only one transdermal patch at a time. \n- When you remove the transdermal patch, check your skin and tell your doctor if you notice a \n\nserious skin reaction (if your skin is very red, itchy or you notice any blisters). \n- The transdermal patch may be affected by direct sunlight or exposure to sunlamps. While you \n\nare wearing the transdermal patch you must keep it covered, e.g. under clothing, if there is a risk \nof exposure to sunlight or sunlamps. Continue to keep the application site covered for a further \n10 days after removing the transdermal patch. \n\n- Contact with water during bathing or showering will not change the way SANCUSO works. \n- However, the transdermal patch may become partially unstuck. Try to avoid wearing the \n\ntransdermal patch in water for long periods of time. \n- There is no information on the effect on the transdermal patch of activities such as strenuous \n\nexercise or the use of sauna or whirlpools; therefore, you should avoid these activities while \nwearing this transdermal patch. \n\n- You should avoid external heat (for example hot water bottles or heat pads) on the area of the \ntransdermal patch. \n\n \nWhen to apply and remove the transdermal patch \nDo not remove the transdermal patch from the sachet until you are ready to use it. Apply a transdermal \npatch at least 1 day (24 hours) before you are scheduled to have chemotherapy treatment. The \ntransdermal patch may be applied up to a maximum of 2 days (48 hours) before chemotherapy. Wear \nthe transdermal patch all the time during your chemotherapy. The transdermal patch can be worn for \nup to 7 days depending on the duration of your chemotherapy treatment. Remove the transdermal \npatch at least 1 day (24 hours) after completing your chemotherapy. \n \nWhere to apply the transdermal patch \nPut the transdermal patch on a clean, dry, healthy area of skin on the outside part of your upper arm. If \nyour arms are not suitable areas to apply the transdermal patch your doctor may ask you to put it on \nyour abdomen. The area you choose should not be oily, recently shaved or have any skin problems \nsuch as being injured (cut or scraped) or irritated (redness or a rash). Do not put SANCUSO on areas \nthat have been treated with creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products that could keep the \ntransdermal patch from sticking well to your skin. \n \nHow to apply the transdermal patch \n1. Remove a sachet from the box and tear it open using the slit provided. Each sachet contains one \n\ntransdermal patch stuck onto a rigid plastic film. \n2. Take the transdermal patch out of the sachet. \n\n \n3. The sticky side of the transdermal patch is covered by a two-piece rigid plastic film. Bend the \n\ntransdermal patch in the middle and remove one half of the rigid plastic film. Be careful not to \nstick the transdermal patch to itself and avoid touching the sticky side of the transdermal patch. \n\n4. While holding the remaining half of the rigid plastic film, apply the transdermal patch to the skin \non the outside part of your upper arm. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n5. Remove the second half of the rigid plastic film and press the whole transdermal patch firmly in \nplace with your fingers and smooth down. Press firmly making sure there is good contact with \nthe skin, especially around the edges. \n\n6. Wash your hands after applying the transdermal patch. \n7. Keep the transdermal patch in place for the whole time you are having chemotherapy. \n8. Do not re-use the transdermal patch after removal, see below for instructions on transdermal \n\npatch removal and disposal (see section 5). \n \nAfter removing the transdermal patch \n1. The used transdermal patch will still contain some granisetron and should be disposed of \n\nimmediately as described in section 5. \n2. After removing the transdermal patch you may find some sticky material is left on your skin. \n\nGently wash the area with soap and water to remove it. Alcohol or other dissolving liquids such \nas nail polish remover may cause skin irritation and should not be used. \n\n3. Wash your hands. \n4. You may see mild redness on the skin where the transdermal patch is removed. This redness \n\nshould go away over time. If it does not, tell your doctor. \n \nIf the transdermal patch becomes unstuck \nIf the transdermal patch starts to become unstuck, the same transdermal patch may be secured to the \nsame area of skin. If required, use surgical bandages or medical adhesive tape to keep the transdermal \npatch in place. If the transdermal patch is lost or becomes damaged go back to your doctor. \n \nIf you use more SANCUSO than you should \nIf you use more SANCUSO than you should, simply remove the extra patch(es) and contact your \ndoctor. \n \nIf you forget to use SANCUSO \nIt is important to use this medicinal product as instructed by your doctor to prevent you feeling sick or \nbeing sick following your chemotherapy. If you have forgotten to apply your transdermal patch at the \nright time, apply it as soon as you remember, and tell your doctor as soon as possible before your \nchemotherapy treatment. \n \nIf you stop using SANCUSO \nIt is important to use this medicine during the whole length of your chemotherapy (up to 7 days) to \nprevent you feeling sick or being sick following your chemotherapy. Talk to your doctor if you want \nto remove the patch before the end of your chemotherapy treatment course (up to 7 days). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you are being treated with chemotherapy that is moderately or highly capable of making you feel \nsick, you may still be sick despite treatment with anti-sickness medicine, including this medicine. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop constipation or if your stomach becomes painful or \nswollen. Constipation is a common side effect and may affect up to 1 in 10 people. \n \nRemove the transdermal patch and tell your doctor if you notice a serious skin reaction (if your \nskin is very red, itchy or you notice any blisters).

nurse if you are not sure. the recommended dose is one single transdermal patch. the medicine in the transdermal patch passes gradually through your skin into your body and, therefore, the patch is applied 1 to 2 days (24 to 48 hours) before the start of chemotherapy treatment. this medicine is for transdermal use. this medicine delivers the active substance slowly and constantly through your skin and into your blood stream for the duration that you are wearing the transdermal patch. things to remember when using the transdermal patch - do not keep or store the transdermal patch outside the sealed sachet. - do not cut the transdermal patch into smaller pieces. - use only one transdermal patch at a time. - when you remove the transdermal patch, check your skin and tell your doctor if you notice a serious skin reaction (if your skin is very red, itchy or you notice any blisters). - the transdermal patch may be affected by direct sunlight or exposure to sunlamps. while you are wearing the transdermal patch you must keep it covered, e.g. under clothing, if there is a risk of exposure to sunlight or sunlamps. continue to keep the application site covered for a further 10 days after removing the transdermal patch. - contact with water during bathing or showering will not change the way sancuso works. - however, the transdermal patch may become partially unstuck. try to avoid wearing the transdermal patch in water for long periods of time. - there is no information on the effect on the transdermal patch of activities such as strenuous exercise or the use of sauna or whirlpools; therefore, you should avoid these activities while wearing this transdermal patch. - you should avoid external heat (for example hot water bottles or heat pads) on the area of the transdermal patch. when to apply and remove the transdermal patch do not remove the transdermal patch from the sachet until you are ready to use it. apply a transdermal patch at least 1 day (24 hours) before you are scheduled to have chemotherapy treatment. the transdermal patch may be applied up to a maximum of 2 days (48 hours) before chemotherapy. wear the transdermal patch all the time during your chemotherapy. the transdermal patch can be worn for up to 7 days depending on the duration of your chemotherapy treatment. remove the transdermal patch at least 1 day (24 hours) after completing your chemotherapy. where to apply the transdermal patch put the transdermal patch on a clean, dry, healthy area of skin on the outside part of your upper arm. if your arms are not suitable areas to apply the transdermal patch your doctor may ask you to put it on your abdomen. the area you choose should not be oily, recently shaved or have any skin problems such as being injured (cut or scraped) or irritated (redness or a rash). do not put sancuso on areas that have been treated with creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products that could keep the transdermal patch from sticking well to your skin. how to apply the transdermal patch 1. remove a sachet from the box and tear it open using the slit provided. each sachet contains one transdermal patch stuck onto a rigid plastic film. 2. take the transdermal patch out of the sachet. 3. the sticky side of the transdermal patch is covered by a two-piece rigid plastic film. bend the transdermal patch in the middle and remove one half of the rigid plastic film. be careful not to stick the transdermal patch to itself and avoid touching the sticky side of the transdermal patch. 4. while holding the remaining half of the rigid plastic film, apply the transdermal patch to the skin on the outside part of your upper arm. 5. remove the second half of the rigid plastic film and press the whole transdermal patch firmly in place with your fingers and smooth down. press firmly making sure there is good contact with the skin, especially around the edges. 6. wash your hands after applying the transdermal patch. 7. keep the transdermal patch in place for the whole time you are having chemotherapy. 8. do not re-use the transdermal patch after removal, see below for instructions on transdermal patch removal and disposal (see section 5). after removing the transdermal patch 1. the used transdermal patch will still contain some granisetron and should be disposed of immediately as described in section 5. 2. after removing the transdermal patch you may find some sticky material is left on your skin. gently wash the area with soap and water to remove it. alcohol or other dissolving liquids such as nail polish remover may cause skin irritation and should not be used. 3. wash your hands. 4. you may see mild redness on the skin where the transdermal patch is removed. this redness should go away over time. if it does not, tell your doctor. if the transdermal patch becomes unstuck if the transdermal patch starts to become unstuck, the same transdermal patch may be secured to the same area of skin. if required, use surgical bandages or medical adhesive tape to keep the transdermal patch in place. if the transdermal patch is lost or becomes damaged go back to your doctor. if you use more sancuso than you should if you use more sancuso than you should, simply remove the extra patch(es) and contact your doctor. if you forget to use sancuso it is important to use this medicinal product as instructed by your doctor to prevent you feeling sick or being sick following your chemotherapy. if you have forgotten to apply your transdermal patch at the right time, apply it as soon as you remember, and tell your doctor as soon as possible before your chemotherapy treatment. if you stop using sancuso it is important to use this medicine during the whole length of your chemotherapy (up to 7 days) to prevent you feeling sick or being sick following your chemotherapy. talk to your doctor if you want to remove the patch before the end of your chemotherapy treatment course (up to 7 days). if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "sancuso", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine",
