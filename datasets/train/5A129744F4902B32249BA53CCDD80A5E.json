NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nImprida 5 mg/80 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate) and 80 mg of valsartan. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nDark yellow, round film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, imprinted with \u201cNVR\u201d on one side and \n\n\u201cNV\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nImprida is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or \n\nvalsartan monotherapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nImprida 5 mg/80 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 80 mg alone. \n\n \n\nImprida can be used with or without food. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before \n\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \n\nto the fixed-dose combination may be considered. \n\n \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/capsules may be \n\nswitched to Imprida containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere are no available clinical data in severely renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is \n\nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Monitoring of potassium levels and \n\ncreatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nImprida is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nCaution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with hepatic impairment or \n\nbiliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\nwithout cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. Amlodipine dosage \n\nrecommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nWhen switching eligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to \n\namlodipine or Imprida, the lowest available dose of amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine \n\ncomponent, respectively, should be used. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nIn elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage. When switching eligible elderly \n\nhypertensive patients (see section 4.1) to amlodipine or Imprida, the lowest available dose of \n\namlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine component, respectively, should be used. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Imprida in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. \n\nIt is recommended to take Imprida with some water. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of Imprida with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n\uf0b7 Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hypotension. \n\n\uf0b7 Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n\uf0b7 Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive \n\ncardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n\uf0b7 Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with \n\nImprida in placebo-controlled studies. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as \n\nvolume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin \n\nreceptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Correction of this condition prior to \n\nadministration of Imprida or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf hypotension occurs with Imprida, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if \n\nnecessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood \n\npressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be \n\nundertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nImprida should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal \n\nartery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine may increase in \n\nsuch patients. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida in patients who have had a recent kidney \n\ntransplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half life of amlodipine is prolonged and \n\nAUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dosage recommendations have not \n\nbeen established. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with \n\nmild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders. \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR >30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAngioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling \n\nof the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of \n\nthese patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products, including ACE - \n\ninhibitors. Imprida should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop angioedema and \n\nshould not be re-administered. \n\n \n\nHeart failure/post-myocardial infarction \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or \n\nprogressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been \n\nreported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should \n\nalways include assessment of renal function. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from mitral stenosis or \n\nsignificant aortic stenosis that is not high grade. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren increases the risk of \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \n\nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is therefore not \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \n\nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood \n\npressure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy. \n\n \n\nImprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteractions common to the combination \n\nNo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with Imprida and other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive agents \n\nCommonly used antihypertensive agents (e.g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products \n\nwhich may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for \n\ntreatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination. \n\n \n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nSimvastatin \n\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% \n\nincrease in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to limit the \n\ndose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nDantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOthers \n\nIn clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, \n\nwarfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInteractions linked to valsartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nLithium \n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \n\nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists, including valsartan. Therefore, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. If a diurectic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\npresumably be increased further with Imprida. \n\n \n\nPotassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other \n\nsubstances that may increase potassium levels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, \n\nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, \n\nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs \n\nWhen angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the \n\nantihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and \n\nNSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum \n\npotassium. Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, \n\nas well as adequate hydration of the patient. \n\n \n\nInhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the \n\nhepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter MRP2. Co-administration \n\nof inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) may \n\nincrease the systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren \n\nClinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE \n\ninhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to \n\nthe use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nOthers \n\nIn monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the \n\nfollowing substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of Imprida during breast-feeding, therefore Imprida is \n\nnot recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\n\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPatients taking Imprida and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account that dizziness \n\nor weariness may occasionally occur. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be \n\nimpaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of Imprida has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 \n\nof whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine. The following adverse reactions were \n\nfound to be the most frequently occurring or the most significant or severe: nasopharyngitis, \n\ninfluenza, hypersensitivity, headache, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, oedema, pitting oedema, \n\nfacial oedema, oedema peripheral, fatigue, flushing, asthenia and hot flush. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \n\nvery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \n\nto

Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Clinically significant hypotension \n\ndue to Imprida overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of \n\ncardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume \n\nand urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, \n\nprovided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial \n\nin reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nBoth valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II \n\nantagonists, combinations; angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel blockers, ATC code: \n\nC09DB01 \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nImprida combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \n\npressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class \n\nand valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines. The combination of these substances \n\nhas an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either \n\ncomponent alone. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nThe combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood \n\npressure across its therapeutic dose range. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the \n\ncombination persisted for 24 hours. \n\n \n\nPlacebo-controlled trials \n\nOver 1,400 hypertensive patients received Imprida once daily in two placebo-controlled trials. Adults \n\nwith mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n\uf0b395 and <110 mmHg) were enrolled. Patients with high cardiovascular risks \u2013 heart failure, type I and \n\npoorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year \u2013 \n\nwere excluded. \n\n \n\nActive-controlled trials in patients who were non-responders to monotherapy \n\nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation \n\nof blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients \n\nnot adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg, compared to 53% \n\nof patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg. The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an \n\nadditional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/4.8 mmHg and 3.9/2.9 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only. \n\n \nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation \n\nof blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients \n\nnot adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg. The addition of \n\nvalsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of \n\n2.9/2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only. \n\n \n\nImprida was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with mean sitting \n\ndiastolic blood pressure \u2265110 mmHg and <120 mmHg. In this study (baseline blood pressure \n\n171/113 mmHg), an Imprida regimen of 5 mg/160 mg titrated to 10 mg/160 mg reduced sitting blood \n\npressure by 36/29 mmHg as compared to 32/28 mmHg with a regimen of \n\nlisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \n\nIn two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Imprida was maintained for over one year. Abrupt \n\nwithdrawal of Imprida has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. \n\n \n\nAge, gender, race or body mass index (\u226530 kg/m\n2\n, <30 kg/m\n\n2\n) did not influence the response to \n\nImprida. \n\n \n\nImprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Valsartan has been \n\nstudied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure. Amlodipine has been studied in \n\npatients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary \n\nartery disease. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth \n\nmuscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through \n\nspecific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% versus 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there \n\nwas no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and \n\nchlorthalidone-based therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. The \n\nincreased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may \n\nstimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 \n\nreceptor. Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much \n\n(about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. \n\n \n\nValsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to \n\nangiotensin II and degrades bradykinin. Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of \n\nbradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing. In \n\nclinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was \n\nsignificantly (p <0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE \n\ninhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively). In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough \n\nduring ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those \n\nreceiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE \n\ninhibitor (p <0.05). Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels \n\nknown to be important in cardiovascular regulation. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4\u20136 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2\u20134 weeks and is \n\nsustained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with \n\nrebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events. \n\n \n\nOther: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \n\ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs \n\nNephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an \n\nARB. \n\n \n\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \n\ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-\n\nD was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \n\n \n\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes \n\nand mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \n\ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \n\nresults are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs. \n\n \n\nACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \n\nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor \n\nor an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular \n\ndisease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. \n\nCardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in \n\nthe placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are \n\nreached in 3 and 6\u20138 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of Imprida are equivalent \n\nto the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6\u201312 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7\u20138 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2\u20134 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94\u201397%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t\u00bd\u03b1 <1 h and t\u00bd\u00df about 9 h). Valsartan \n\nis primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as \n\nunchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h \n\nand its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease of approximately 40\u201360% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic \n\nliver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy \n\nvolunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Caution should be exercised in patients with liver \n\ndisease (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows: \n\nHistopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an \n\nexposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan \n\nand 10 mg amlodipine. At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa \n\nin both females and males. Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5\u2013\n\n11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). \n\n \n\nAn increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as \n\nwell as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an \n\nexposure of 8\u201313 (valsartan) and 7\u20138 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and \n\n10 mg amlodipine. Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5\u201311.0 times \n\nthe clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). \n\n \n\nIn an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed \n\nsternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and \n\n10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine. Dilated ureters \n\nwere also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg \n\nvalsartan). There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in \n\nthis study. The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and \n\n4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC). \n\n \n\nFor the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia \n\nand basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and \n\n18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose \n\nof 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the \n\nkidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and \n\ncreatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nImprida 5 mg/160 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate) and 160 mg of \n\nvalsartan. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nDark yellow, oval film-coated tablet, imprinted with \u201cNVR\u201d on one side and \u201cECE\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nImprida is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or \n\nvalsartan monotherapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nImprida 5 mg/160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone. \n\n \n\nImprida can be used with or without food. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before \n\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \n\nto the fixed-dose combination may be considered. \n\n \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/capsules may be \n\nswitched to Imprida containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere are no available clinical data in severely renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is \n\nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Monitoring of potassium levels and \n\ncreatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nImprida is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nCaution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with hepatic impairment or \n\nbiliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\nwithout cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. Amlodipine dosage \n\nrecommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nWhen switching eligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to \n\namlodipine or Imprida, the lowest available dose of amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine \n\ncomponent, respectively, should be used. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nIn elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage. When switching eligible elderly \n\nhypertensive patients (see section 4.1) to amlodipine or Imprida, the lowest available dose of \n\namlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine component, respectively, should be used. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Imprida in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. \n\nIt is recommended to take Imprida with some water. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of Imprida with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n\uf0b7 Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hypotension. \n\n\uf0b7 Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n\uf0b7 Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive \n\ncardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n\uf0b7 Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with \n\nImprida in placebo-controlled studies. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as \n\nvolume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin \n\nreceptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Correction of this condition prior to \n\nadministration of Imprida or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf hypotension occurs with Imprida, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if \n\nnecessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood \n\npressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be \n\nundertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nImprida should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal \n\nartery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine may increase in \n\nsuch patients. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida in patients who have had a recent kidney \n\ntransplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half life of amlodipine is prolonged and \n\nAUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dosage recommendations have not \n\nbeen established. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with \n\nmild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders. \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR >30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAngioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling \n\nof the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of \n\nthese patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products, including ACE \n\ninhibitors. Imprida should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop angioedema and \n\nshould not be re-administered. \n\n \n\nHeart failure/post-myocardial infarction \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or \n\nprogressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been \n\nreported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should \n\nalways include assessment of renal function. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from mitral stenosis or \n\nsignificant aortic stenosis that is not high grade. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren increases the risk of \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \n\nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is therefore not \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \n\nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood \n\npressure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy. \n\n \n\nImprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteractions common to the combination \n\nNo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with Imprida and other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive agents \n\nCommonly used antihypertensive agents (e.g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products \n\nwhich may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for \n\ntreatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination. \n\n \n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nSimvastatin \n\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% \n\nincrease in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to limit the \n\ndose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nDantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOthers \n\nIn clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, \n\nwarfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInteractions linked to valsartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nLithium \n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \n\nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists, including valsartan. Therefore, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. If a diurectic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\npresumably be increased further with Imprida. \n\n \n\nPotassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other \n\nsubstances that may increase potassium levels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, \n\nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, \n\nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs \n\nWhen angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the \n\nantihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and \n\nNSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum \n\npotassium. Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, \n\nas well as adequate hydration of the patient. \n\n \n\nInhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the \n\nhepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter MRP2. Co-administration \n\nof inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) may \n\nincrease the systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren \n\nClinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE \n\ninhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to \n\nthe use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nOthers \n\nIn monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the \n\nfollowing substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of Imprida during breast-feeding, therefore Imprida is \n\nnot recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\n\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPatients taking Imprida and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account that dizziness \n\nor weariness may occasionally occur. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be \n\nimpaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of Imprida has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 \n\nof whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine. The following adverse reactions were \n\nfound to be the most frequently occurring or the most significant or severe: nasopharyngitis, \n\ninfluenza, hypersensitivity, headache, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, oedema, pitting oedema, \n\nfacial oedema, oedema peripheral, fatigue, flushing, asthenia and hot flush. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \n\nvery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \n\nto

The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is \n\npossibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive \n\nperipheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic \n\nhypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Clinically significant hypotension \n\ndue to Imprida overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of \n\ncardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume \n\nand urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, \n\nprovided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial \n\nin reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nBoth valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II \n\nantagonists, combinations; angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel blockers, ATC code: \n\nC09DB01 \n\n \n\nImprida combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \n\npressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class \n\nand valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines. The combination of these substances \n\nhas an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either \n\ncomponent alone. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nThe combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood \n\npressure across its therapeutic dose range. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the \n\ncombination persisted for 24 hours. \n\n \n\nPlacebo-controlled trials \n\nOver 1,400 hypertensive patients received Imprida once daily in two placebo-controlled trials. Adults \n\nwith mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n\uf0b395 and <110 mmHg) were enrolled. Patients with high cardiovascular risks \u2013 heart failure, type I and \n\npoorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year \u2013 \n\nwere excluded. \n\n \n\nActive-controlled trials in patients who were non-responders to monotherapy \n\nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation \n\nof blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients \n\nnot adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg, compared to 53% \n\nof patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg. The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an \n\nadditional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/4.8 mmHg and 3.9/2.9 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation \n\nof blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients \n\nnot adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg. The addition of \n\nvalsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of \n\n2.9/2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only. \n\n \n\nImprida was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with mean sitting \n\ndiastolic blood pressure \u2265110 mmHg and <120 mmHg. In this study (baseline blood pressure \n\n171/113 mmHg), an Imprida regimen of 5 mg/160 mg titrated to 10 mg/160 mg reduced sitting blood \n\npressure by 36/29 mmHg as compared to 32/28 mmHg with a regimen of \n\nlisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \n\nIn two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Imprida was maintained for over one year. Abrupt \n\nwithdrawal of Imprida has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. \n\n \n\nAge, gender, race or body mass index (\u226530 kg/m\n2\n, <30 kg/m\n\n2\n) did not influence the response to \n\nImprida. \n\n \n\nImprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Valsartan has been \n\nstudied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure. Amlodipine has been studied in \n\npatients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary \n\nartery disease. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth \n\nmuscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through \n\nspecific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% versus 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there \n\nwas no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and \n\nchlorthalidone-based therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. The \n\nincreased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may \n\nstimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 \n\nreceptor. Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much \n\n(about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. \n\n \n\nValsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to \n\nangiotensin II and degrades bradykinin. Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of \n\nbradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing. In \n\nclinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was \n\nsignificantly (p <0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE \n\ninhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively). In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough \n\nduring ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those \n\nreceiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE \n\ninhibitor (p <0.05). Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels \n\nknown to be important in cardiovascular regulation. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4\u20136 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2\u20134 weeks and is \n\nsustained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with \n\nrebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nOther: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \n\ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs \n\nNephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an \n\nARB. \n\n \n\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \n\ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-\n\nD was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \n\n \n\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes \n\nand mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \n\ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \n\nresults are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs. \n\n \n\nACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \n\nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor \n\nor an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular \n\ndisease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. \n\nCardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in \n\nthe placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are \n\nreached in 3 and 6\u20138 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of Imprida are equivalent \n\nto the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6\u201312 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7\u20138 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2\u20134 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94\u201397%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t\u00bd\u03b1 <1 h and t\u00bd\u00df about 9 h). Valsartan \n\nis primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as \n\nunchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h \n\nand its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease of approximately 40\u201360% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic \n\nliver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy \n\nvolunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Caution should be exercised in patients with liver \n\ndisease (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows: \n\nHistopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an \n\nexposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan \n\nand 10 mg amlodipine. At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa \n\nin both females and males. Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5\u2013\n\n11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\nAn increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as \n\nwell as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an \n\nexposure of 8\u201313 (valsartan) and 7\u20138 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and \n\n10 mg amlodipine. Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5\u201311.0 times \n\nthe clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). \n\n \n\nIn an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed \n\nsternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and \n\n10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine. Dilated ureters \n\nwere also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg \n\nvalsartan). There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in \n\nthis study. The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and \n\n4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC). \n\n \n\nFor the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia \n\nand basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and \n\n18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose \n\nof 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the \n\nkidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and \n\ncreatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were \n\nconsidered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged \n\nhypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy \n\nof the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nImprida 10 mg/160 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate) and 160 mg of \n\nvalsartan. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nLight yellow, oval film-coated tablet, imprinted with \u201cNVR\u201d on one side and \u201cUIC\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nImprida is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or \n\nvalsartan monotherapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Imprida is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nImprida 10 mg/160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with amlodipine 10 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone or with Imprida 5 mg/160 mg. \n\n \n\nImprida can be used with or without food. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before \n\nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \n\nto the fixed-dose combination may be considered. \n\n \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/capsules may be \n\nswitched to Imprida containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere are no available clinical data in severely renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is \n\nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Monitoring of potassium levels and \n\ncreatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nImprida is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nCaution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with hepatic impairment or \n\nbiliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\nwithout cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. Amlodipine dosage \n\nrecommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nWhen switching eligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to \n\namlodipine or Imprida, the lowest available dose of amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine \n\ncomponent, respectively, should be used. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nIn elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage. When switching eligible elderly \n\nhypertensive patients (see section 4.1) to amlodipine or Imprida, the lowest available dose of \n\namlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine component, respectively, should be used. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Imprida in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. \n\nIt is recommended to take Imprida with some water. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of Imprida with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n\uf0b7 Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n\uf0b7 Severe hypotension. \n\n\uf0b7 Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n\uf0b7 Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive \n\ncardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n\uf0b7 Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nExcessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with \n\nImprida in placebo-controlled studies. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as \n\nvolume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin \n\nreceptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Correction of this condition prior to \n\nadministration of Imprida or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nIf hypotension occurs with Imprida, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if \n\nnecessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood \n\npressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be \n\nundertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nImprida should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal \n\nartery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine may increase in \n\nsuch patients. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida in patients who have had a recent kidney \n\ntransplantation. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half life of amlodipine is prolonged and \n\nAUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dosage recommendations have not \n\nbeen established. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with \n\nmild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders. \n\n \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Imprida is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR >30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAngioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling \n\nof the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of \n\nthese patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products, including ACE \n\ninhibitors. Imprida should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop angioedema and \n\nshould not be re-administered. \n\n \n\nHeart failure/post-myocardial infarction \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or \n\nprogressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been \n\nreported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should \n\nalways include assessment of renal function. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from mitral stenosis or \n\nsignificant aortic stenosis that is not high grade. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren increases the risk of \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \n\nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is therefore not \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \n\nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood \n\npressure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy. \n\n \n\nImprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteractions common to the combination \n\nNo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with Imprida and other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOther antihypertensive agents \n\nCommonly used antihypertensive agents (e.g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products \n\nwhich may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for \n\ntreatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination. \n\n \n\nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43 \n\nSimvastatin \n\nCo-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% \n\nincrease in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to limit the \n\ndose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nDantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n\nOthers \n\nIn clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, \n\nwarfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInteractions linked to valsartan \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\nLithium \n\nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \n\nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists, including valsartan. Therefore, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. If a diurectic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\npresumably be increased further with Imprida. \n\n \n\nPotassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other \n\nsubstances that may increase potassium levels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, \n\nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, \n\nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs \n\nWhen angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the \n\nantihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and \n\nNSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum \n\npotassium. Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, \n\nas well as adequate hydration of the patient. \n\n \n\nInhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the \n\nhepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter MRP2. Co-administration \n\nof inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) may \n\nincrease the systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren \n\nClinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE \n\ninhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to \n\nthe use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nOthers \n\nIn monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the \n\nfollowing substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections \n\n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo information is available regarding the use of Imprida during breast-feeding, therefore Imprida is \n\nnot recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\n\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPatients taking Imprida and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account that dizziness \n\nor weariness may occasionally occur. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be \n\nimpaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of Imprida has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 \n\nof whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine. The following adverse reactions were \n\nfound to be the most frequently occurring or the most significant or severe: nasopharyngitis, \n\ninfluenza, hypersensitivity, headache, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, oedema, pitting oedema, \n\nfacial oedema, oedema peripheral, fatigue, flushing, asthenia and hot flush. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \n\nvery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \n\nto

The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is \n\npossibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive \n\nperipheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic \n\nhypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Clinically significant hypotension \n\ndue to Imprida overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of \n\ncardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume \n\nand urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, \n\nprovided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial \n\nin reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nBoth valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II \n\nantagonists, combinations; angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel blockers, ATC code: \n\nC09DB01 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nImprida combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood \n\npressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class \n\nand valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines. The combination of these substances \n\nhas an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either \n\ncomponent alone. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nThe combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood \n\npressure across its therapeutic dose range. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the \n\ncombination persisted for 24 hours. \n\n \n\nPlacebo-controlled trials \n\nOver 1,400 hypertensive patients received Imprida once daily in two placebo-controlled trials. Adults \n\nwith mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n\uf0b395 and <110 mmHg) were enrolled. Patients with high cardiovascular risks \u2013 heart failure, type I and \n\npoorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year \u2013 \n\nwere excluded. \n\n \n\nActive-controlled trials in patients who were non-responders to monotherapy \n\nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation \n\nof blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients \n\nnot adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg, compared to 53% \n\nof patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg. The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an \n\nadditional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/4.8 mmHg and 3.9/2.9 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only. \n\n \nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation \n\nof blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients \n\nnot adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg. The addition of \n\nvalsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of \n\n2.9/2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only. \n\n \n\nImprida was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with mean sitting \n\ndiastolic blood pressure \u2265110 mmHg and <120 mmHg. In this study (baseline blood pressure \n\n171/113 mmHg), an Imprida regimen of 5 mg/160 mg titrated to 10 mg/160 mg reduced sitting blood \n\npressure by 36/29 mmHg as compared to 32/28 mmHg with a regimen of \n\nlisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \n\nIn two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Imprida was maintained for over one year. Abrupt \n\nwithdrawal of Imprida has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. \n\n \n\nAge, gender, race or body mass index (\u226530 kg/m\n2\n, <30 kg/m\n\n2\n) did not influence the response to \n\nImprida. \n\n \n\nImprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Valsartan has been \n\nstudied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure. Amlodipine has been studied in \n\npatients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary \n\nartery disease. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n51 \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Imprida inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth \n\nmuscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through \n\nspecific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels \n\nwith chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% versus 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there \n\nwas no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and \n\nchlorthalidone-based therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n52 \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. The \n\nincreased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may \n\nstimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 \n\nreceptor. Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much \n\n(about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. \n\n \n\nValsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to \n\nangiotensin II and degrades bradykinin. Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of \n\nbradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing. In \n\nclinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was \n\nsignificantly (p <0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE \n\ninhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively). In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough \n\nduring ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those \n\nreceiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE \n\ninhibitor (p <0.05). Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels \n\nknown to be important in cardiovascular regulation. \n\n \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4\u20136 hours. The \n\nantihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the \n\nmaximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2\u20134 weeks and is \n\nsustained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with \n\nrebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events. \n\n \n\nOther: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \n\ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs \n\nNephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an \n\nARB. \n\n \n\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \n\ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-\n\nD was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \n\n \n\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes \n\nand mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \n\ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \n\nresults are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs. \n\n \n\nACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \n\nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor \n\nor an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular \n\ndisease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. \n\nCardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in \n\nthe placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nFollowing oral administration of Imprida, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are \n\nreached in 3 and 6\u20138 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of Imprida are equivalent \n\nto the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6\u201312 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as \n\nbetween 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have \n\nshown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive \n\nmetabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for \n\n7\u20138 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nAbsorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan \n\nare reached in 2\u20134 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as \n\nmeasured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, \n\nalthough from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted \n\ngroups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in \n\nthe therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is \n\nabout 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is \n\nhighly bound to serum proteins (94\u201397%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is \n\nrecovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations \n\n(less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination: Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t\u00bd\u03b1 <1 h and t\u00bd\u00df about 9 h). Valsartan \n\nis primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as \n\nunchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h \n\nand its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As \n\nexpected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no \n\ncorrelation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease of approximately 40\u201360% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic \n\nliver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy \n\nvolunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Caution should be exercised in patients with liver \n\ndisease (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan \n\nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows: \n\nHistopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an \n\nexposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan \n\nand 10 mg amlodipine. At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa \n\nin both females and males. Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5\u2013\n\n11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). \n\n \n\nAn increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as \n\nwell as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an \n\nexposure of 8\u201313 (valsartan) and 7\u20138 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and \n\n10 mg amlodipine. Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5\u201311.0 times \n\nthe clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). \n\n \n\nIn an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed \n\nsternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and \n\n10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine. Dilated ureters \n\nwere also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg \n\nvalsartan). There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in \n\nthis study. The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and \n\n4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC). \n\n \n\nFor the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia \n\nand basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and \n\n18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n basis (calculations assume an oral dose \n\nof 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the \n\nkidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and \n\ncreatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were \n\nconsidered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged \n\nhypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy \n\nof the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Imprida is and what it is used for \n\n2.

What Imprida is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nImprida tablets contain two substances called amlodipine and valsartan. Both of these substances help \n\nto control high blood pressure. \n\n\uf02d Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called \u201ccalcium channel blockers\u201d. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n\uf02d Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called \u201cangiotensin-II receptor antagonists\u201d. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\nThis means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the \n\nblood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not controlled enough \n\nwith either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Imprida \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers. This may involve \n\nitching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing. \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Imprida. \n\n\uf02d if you have severe liver problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n\uf02d if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida in early pregnancy, \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n\uf02d if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n\uf02d if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \n\nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n\uf02d if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n85 \n\n\uf02d if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood \n\npressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren. \nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Imprida: \n\n\uf02d if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n\uf02d if you have liver or kidney problems. \n\n\uf02d if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your \n\nkidney arteries. \n\n\uf02d if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called \u201cprimary hyperaldosteronism\u201d. \n\n\uf02d if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor\u2019s \n\ninstructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. \n\n\uf02d if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called \u201caortic \n\nor mitral stenosis\u201d) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n\u201cobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u201d). \n\n\uf02d if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other \n\nmedicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, \n\nstop taking Imprida and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Imprida \n\nagain. \n\n\uf02d if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\uf02d an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n\uf02d aliskiren. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \n\npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Imprida\u201d. \n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imprida. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Imprida in children and adolescents is not recommended (aged below 18 years old). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Imprida \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases \n\nyou may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \n\nbelow: \n\n\uf02d ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take Imprida\u201d and \n\n\u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d); \n\n\uf02d diuretics (a type of medicine also called \u201cwater tablets\u201d which increases the amount of urine \n\nyou produce); \n\n\uf02d lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); \n\n\uf02d potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and \n\nother substances that may increase potassium levels; \n\n\uf02d certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or \n\nselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your \n\nkidney function; \n\n\uf02d anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone); \n\n\uf02d St. John\u2019s wort; \n\n\uf02d nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called \u201cvasodilators\u201d; \n\n\uf02d medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir); \n\n\uf02d medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n86 \n\n\uf02d medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\ntalithromycin); \n\n\uf02d verapamil, diltiazem (heart medicines); \n\n\uf02d simvastatin (a medicine used to control high cholesterol levels); \n\n\uf02d dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities); \n\n\uf02d medicines used to protect against transplant rejection (ciclosporin). \n\n \n\nImprida with food and drink \n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking Imprida. This is \n\nbecause grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active \n\nsubstance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering \n\neffect of Imprida. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nPregnancy \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \n\nadvise you to stop taking Imprida before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida. Imprida is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and must not be taken when more than 3 months \n\npregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Imprida is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate. So, if you are \n\nnot sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you \n\nneed to concentrate on. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Imprida \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. This will help you get the best results and lower the risk of side effects. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Imprida is one tablet per day. \n\n\uf02d It is preferable to take your medicine at the same time each day. \n\n\uf02d Swallow the tablets with a glass of water. \n\n\uf02d You can take Imprida with or without food. Do not take Imprida with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice. \n\n \n\nDepending on how you respond to the treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose. \n\n \n\nDo not exceed the prescribed dose. \n\n \n\nImprida and older people (age 65 years or over) \n\nYour doctor should exercise caution when increasing your dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n87 \n\nIf you take more Imprida than you should \n\nIf you have taken too many tablets of Imprida, or if someone else has taken your tablets, consult a \n\ndoctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Imprida \n\nIf you forget to take this medicine, take it as soon as you remember.

What Imprida is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nImprida tablets contain two substances called amlodipine and valsartan. Both of these substances help \n\nto control high blood pressure. \n\n\uf02d Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called \u201ccalcium channel blockers\u201d. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n\uf02d Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called \u201cangiotensin-II receptor antagonists\u201d. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\nThis means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the \n\nblood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not controlled enough \n\nwith either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Imprida \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers. This may involve \n\nitching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing. \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Imprida. \n\n\uf02d if you have severe liver problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n\uf02d if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida in early pregnancy, \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n\uf02d if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n\uf02d if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \n\nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n\uf02d if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n92 \n\n\uf02d if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood \n\npressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren. \nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Imprida: \n\n\uf02d if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n\uf02d if you have liver or kidney problems. \n\n\uf02d if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your \n\nkidney arteries. \n\n\uf02d if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called \u201cprimary hyperaldosteronism\u201d. \n\n\uf02d if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor\u2019s \n\ninstructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. \n\n\uf02d if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called \u201caortic \n\nor mitral stenosis\u201d) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n\u201cobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u201d). \n\n\uf02d if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other \n\nmedicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, \n\nstop taking Imprida and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Imprida \n\nagain. \n\n\uf02d if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\uf02d an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n\uf02d aliskiren. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \n\npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Imprida\u201d. \n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imprida. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Imprida in children and adolescents is not recommended (aged below 18 years old). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Imprida \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases \n\nyou may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \n\nbelow: \n\n\uf02d ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \n\nImprida\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d); \n\n\uf02d diuretics (a type of medicine also called \u201cwater tablets\u201d which increases the amount of urine \n\nyou produce); \n\n\uf02d lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); \n\n\uf02d potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and \n\nother substances that may increase potassium levels; \n\n\uf02d certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or \n\nselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your \n\nkidney function; \n\n\uf02d anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone); \n\n\uf02d St. John\u2019s wort; \n\n\uf02d nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called \u201cvasodilators\u201d; \n\n\uf02d medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir); \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n93 \n\n\uf02d medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); \n\n\uf02d medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\ntalithromycin); \n\n\uf02d verapamil, diltiazem (heart medicines); \n\n\uf02d simvastatin (a medicine used to control high cholesterol levels); \n\n\uf02d dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities); \n\n\uf02d medicines used to protect against transplant rejection (ciclosporin). \n\n \n\nImprida with food and drink \n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking Imprida. This is \n\nbecause grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active \n\nsubstance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering \n\neffect of Imprida. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nPregnancy \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \n\nadvise you to stop taking Imprida before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida. Imprida is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and must not be taken when more than 3 months \n\npregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Imprida is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate.

What Imprida is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nImprida tablets contain two substances called amlodipine and valsartan. Both of these substances help \n\nto control high blood pressure. \n\n\uf02d Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called \u201ccalcium channel blockers\u201d. Amlodipine \n\nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n\uf02d Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called \u201cangiotensin-II receptor antagonists\u201d. \n\nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\nThis means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the \n\nblood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nImprida is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not controlled enough \n\nwith either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Imprida \n\n \n\nDo not take Imprida \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers. This may involve \n\nitching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing. \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Imprida. \n\n\uf02d if you have severe liver problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n\uf02d if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Imprida in early pregnancy, \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n\uf02d if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n\uf02d if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \n\nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n\uf02d if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n99 \n\n\uf02d if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood \n\npressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren. \nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Imprida and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Imprida: \n\n\uf02d if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n\uf02d if you have liver or kidney problems. \n\n\uf02d if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your \n\nkidney arteries. \n\n\uf02d if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called \u201cprimary hyperaldosteronism\u201d. \n\n\uf02d if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor\u2019s \n\ninstructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. \n\n\uf02d if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called \u201caortic \n\nor mitral stenosis\u201d) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n\u201cobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u201d). \n\n\uf02d if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other \n\nmedicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, \n\nstop taking Imprida and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Imprida \n\nagain. \n\n\uf02d if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\uf02d an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n\uf02d aliskiren. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \n\npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Imprida\u201d. \n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imprida. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Imprida in children and adolescents is not recommended (aged below 18 years old). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Imprida \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases \n\nyou may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed \n\nbelow: \n\n\uf02d ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \n\nImprida\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d); \n\n\uf02d diuretics (a type of medicine also called \u201cwater tablets\u201d which increases the amount of urine \n\nyou produce); \n\n\uf02d lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); \n\n\uf02d potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and \n\nother substances that may increase potassium levels; \n\n\uf02d certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or \n\nselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your \n\nkidney function; \n\n\uf02d anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone); \n\n\uf02d St. John\u2019s wort; \n\n\uf02d nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called \u201cvasodilators\u201d; \n\n\uf02d medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir); \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n100 \n\n\uf02d medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); \n\n\uf02d medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\ntalithromycin); \n\n\uf02d verapamil, diltiazem (heart medicines); \n\n\uf02d simvastatin (a medicine used to control high cholesterol levels); \n\n\uf02d dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities); \n\n\uf02d medicines used to protect against transplant rejection (ciclosporin). \n\n \n\nImprida with food and drink \n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking Imprida. This is \n\nbecause grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active \n\nsubstance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering \n\neffect of Imprida. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nPregnancy \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \n\nadvise you to stop taking Imprida before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida. Imprida is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and must not be taken when more than 3 months \n\npregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Imprida is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate. So, if you are \n\nnot sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you \n\nneed to concentrate on. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

substances help to control high blood pressure. amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called \"calcium channel blockers\". amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. valsartan belongs to a group of substances called \"angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists\". angiotensin ii is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure. valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin ii. this means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. as a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. imprida is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "imprida", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "imprida tablets", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 15}, {"Id":

problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (it is also better to avoid imprida in early pregnancy, see pregnancy section). if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition where your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren. if any of the above applies to you, do not take imprida and talk to your doctor. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking imprida: if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). if you have liver or kidney problems. if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your kidney arteries. if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called \"primary hyperaldosteronism\". if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. follow your doctor's instructions for the starting dose carefully. your doctor may also check your kidney function. if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called \"aortic or mitral stenosis\") or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \"obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"). if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). if you get these symptoms, stop taking imprida and contact your doctor straight away. you should never take imprida again. if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: an ace inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems. aliskiren. your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. see also information under the heading \"do not take imprida\". if any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking imprida. children and adolescents the use of imprida in children and adolescents is not recommended (aged below 18 years old). other medicines and imprida tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. in some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. this applies especially to the medicines listed below: ace inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \"do not take imprida\" and \"warnings and precautions\"); diuretics (a type of medicine also called \"water tablets\" which increases the amount of urine you produce); lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels; certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (nsaids) or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (cox-2 inhibitors). your doctor may also check your kidney function; anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone); st. john's wort; nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other

levels); dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities); medicines used to protect against transplant rejection (ciclosporin). imprida with food and drink grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking imprida. this is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of imprida. pregnancy and breast-feeding pregnancy you must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking imprida before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of imprida. imprida is not recommended in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. breast-feeding tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. imprida is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines this medicine may make you feel dizzy. this can affect how well you can concentrate. so, if you are not sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you
