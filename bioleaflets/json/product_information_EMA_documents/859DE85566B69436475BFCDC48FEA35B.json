PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and effervescent granules for oral suspension: \n– Suspension for oral suspension  \n\n- Granules for oral suspension in a sachet.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDukoral is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 \nin adults and children from 2 years of age who will be visiting endemic/epidemic areas. \n \nThe use of Dukoral should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the variability of epidemiology and the risk of contracting disease in different \ngeographical areas and travelling conditions. \n \nDukoral should not replace standard protective measures. In the event of diarrhoea measures of \nrehydration should be instituted. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nPrimary vaccination schedule \nThe standard primary course of vaccination with Dukoral against cholera consists of 2 doses for \nadults and children from 6 years of age. Children 2 to below 6 years of age should receive 3 doses. \nDoses are to be administered at intervals of at least one week. If more than 6 weeks have elapsed \nbetween doses, the primary immunisation course should be re-started. \n \nImmunisation should be completed at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to V. cholerae O1. \n \nBooster dose \nFor continuous protection against cholera a single booster dose is recommended within 2 years for \nadults and children from 6 years of age, and within 6 months for children aged 2 to below 6 years. No \nclinical efficacy data has been generated on repeat booster dosing. However, immunological and \nduration of protection data suggest that if up to 2 years have elapsed since the last vaccination for \nadults and up to 6 months for children aged 2 to below 6 years a single booster dose should be given. \nIf more than 2 years have elapsed since the last vaccination (more than 6 months for children aged 2 \nto below 6 years) the primary course should be repeated. \n \nChildren less than 2 years \nDukoral has been given to children between 1 and 2 years of age in safety and immunogenicity \nstudies, but the protective efficacy has not been studied in this age group. Therefore, Dukoral is not \nrecommended to be used in children less than 2 years of age.  \n \nElderly \nThere are only very limited data on protective efficacy of the vaccine in subjects aged 65 years and \nmore. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe vaccine is intended for oral use. Before ingestion, the suspension should be mixed with the buffer \n(sodium hydrogen carbonate) solution. The sodium hydrogen carbonate is supplied as effervescent \ngranules, which should be dissolved in a glass of cool water (approx. 150 ml). Chlorinated water can \nbe used. The suspension should then be mixed with the buffer solution and drunk within 2 hours. \nFood and drink should be avoided 1 hour before and 1 hour after vaccination. Oral administration of \nother medicinal products should be avoided within 1 hour before and 1 hour after administration of \nDukoral. \n \nChildren 2 to below 6 years of age: half of the buffer solution is poured away and the remaining part \n(approx. 75 ml) is mixed with the entire contents of the  vial. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to \nformaldehyde. \n \nAdministration of Dukoral should be postponed for subjects suffering from acute gastrointestinal \nillness or acute febrile illness.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNo clinical data on protective efficacy of Dukoral against cholera after administration of booster \ndoses are available. \n \nDukoral confers protection specific to Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1. Immunisation does not protect \nagainst V. cholerae serogroup O139 or other species of Vibrio. \n \nIn subjects infected with HIV, limited data are available on immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. \nVaccine protective efficacy has not been studied. Immunisation of HIV infected subjects could result \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nin transient increases of viral load. Dukoral may not induce protective antibody levels in subjects with \nadvanced HIV disease. However, an effectiveness study in a population with high HIV prevalence \nshowed similar protection as in other populations.  \n \nAntibody response in vaccinees with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be \ninsufficient. \n \nFormaldehyde is used during the manufacturing process and trace amounts may be present in the final \nproduct. Caution should be taken in subjects with known hypersensitivity to formaldehyde. \n \nDukoral contains approximately 1.1 g sodium per dose, which should be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nThe vaccine does not provide complete protection and it is important to adhere additionally to \nstandard protective measures to avoid cholera.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe vaccine is acid labile. Food and/or drink will increase acid production in the stomach and the \neffect of the vaccine may be impaired. Consequently, food and drink should be avoided 1 hour before \nand 1 hour after vaccination.  \n \nOral administration of other vaccines and medicinal products should be avoided 1 hour before and 1 \nhour after administration of Dukoral.  \n \nPreliminary results from a clinical study including a limited number of volunteers showed no \ninteraction with the antibody response to Dukoral when a live oral vaccine (enterocapsules) against \ntyphoid was given simultaneously with Dukoral. The immune response to live typhoid vaccine was \nnot investigated in this study. Similarly, a yellow fever vaccine was given concomitantly with \nDukoral, and there was no interaction observed with the immune response to the yellow fever vaccine. \nThe immune responses to Dukoral were not studied. No other vaccines/ medicinal products, including \noral polio vaccine and antimalarials, have been given simultaneously with Dukoral in clinical studies.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nNo animal data on reproduction toxicity are available. Following careful benefit/risk assessment the \nvaccine may be administered during pregnancy and to breast-feeding women although no specific \nclinical studies have been performed to address this issue. \n \nDuring a mass-vaccination campaign conducted in Zanzibar, 196 pregnant women had received at \nleast one dose of Dukoral. There was no statistically significant evidence of a harmful effect of \nDukoral exposure during pregnancy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere is no evidence of an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of Dukoral was assessed in clinical trials, including both adults and children from 2 years \nof age, conducted in endemic and non-endemic countries for cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia \ncoli (ETEC) producing heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). Over 94,000 doses of Dukoral were administered \nduring the clinical trials. Evaluation of safety varied between trials with respect to mode of \nsurveillance, definition of symptoms and time of follow-up. In the majority of studies adverse events \nwere assessed by passive surveillance. The most frequently reported adverse reactions, such as \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\ngastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loose stools, nausea and vomiting, \noccurred at similar frequencies in vaccine and placebo groups.  \n \nFrequency classification:  Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorder \nRare  Loss of /or poor appetite \nVery rare Dehydration \n \nNervous system disorders \nUncommon Headache \nRare  Dizziness \nVery rare Drowsiness, insomnia, fainting, reduced sense of taste \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nRare  Respiratory symptoms (including rhinitis and cough) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon Diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, stomach/abdominal gurgling (gas),   \n  abdominal discomfort \nRare  Vomiting, nausea \nVery rare Sore throat, dyspepsia \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare Sweating, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery rare Joint pain \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nRare  Fever, malaise \nVery rare Fatigue, shivers \n \nAdverse reactions from post-marketing surveillance  \n\nAdditional adverse reactions reported during post-marketing surveillance are listed below. \n \nInfections and infestations: Gastroenteritis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: Lymphadenitis \nNervous system disorders: Paraesthesia \nVascular disorders: Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnoea, increased sputum \nGastrointestinal disorders: Flatulence \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, angioedema, pruritus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Pain, flu-like syndrome, asthenia, chills \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nData on overdose are limited. Adverse reactions reported are consistent with those seen after the \nrecommended dosing. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Bacterial vaccines, ATC-code: J07AE01 \n \nMechanism of action \n\nThe vaccine contains killed whole V. cholerae O1 bacteria and the recombinant non-toxic B-subunit \nof the cholera toxin (CTB). Bacterial strains of both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes and of El Tor and \nClassical biotypes are included in the vaccine. Dukoral is taken orally with bicarbonate buffer, which \nprotects the antigens from the gastric acid. The vaccine acts by inducing antibodies against both the \nbacterial components and CTB. The antibacterial intestinal antibodies prevent the bacteria from \nattaching to the intestinal wall thereby impeding colonisation of V. cholerae O1. The anti-toxin \nintestinal antibodies prevent the cholera toxin from binding to the intestinal mucosal surface thereby \npreventing the toxin-mediated diarrhoeal symptoms.  \n \nThe heat-labile toxin (LT) of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC ) is structurally, functionally and \nimmunologically similar to CTB. The two toxins cross-react immunologically.  \n \nEfficacy against cholera  \n\nEfficacy against cholera was assessed in three randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical \ntrials conducted in Bangladesh (endemic region) and in Peru (non-endemic region). The number of \npatients enrolled, dosage regimens and follow-up periods are shown in the following table. \n \n\nStudy \nlocation \n\nYear Dosage regimen  Number \n(Age groups) \n\nFollow up \n\nCholera  \n\nBangladesh  1985-88 3 doses at 6 week intervals 89,152 \n(2-65 years) \n\n6 months-5 years \n\nPeru, \nmilitary \n\n \n\n1994 2 doses 7-11 days apart 1,563 \n(18-65 years) \n\n5 months \n\nPeru, \nPampas  \n\n1993-95 2 doses 2 weeks apart with a booster \ndose 1 year later \n\n21,924 \n(2-65 years) \n\n2 years \n\n \nIn the Bangladesh field trial, protective efficacy of Dukoral in the overall population was 85% \n(95%CI: 56, 95, per-protocol analysis) for the initial 6 months of follow-up. Duration of vaccine \nprotection differed by age, lasting for 6 months in children and for 2 years in adults (see table below). \nAn exploratory analysis suggested that 2 vaccine doses seemed as effective as 3 doses in adults.   \n \nTable: Protective efficacy against cholera in the Bangladesh study (per-protocol analysis)  \n Protective efficacy, % (95% CI) \n Adults and children >6 \n\nyear \nChildren 2-6 \n\nyears \n6 months 76 (30, 92) 100 \n1st year 76 (60, 85) 44 (10, 65) \n2nd year 60 (36, 76) 33 (-23, 64) \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nIn the second trial, conducted in Peru and enrolling military recruits, the short-term protective efficacy \nagainst cholera after 2 vaccine doses was 85% (95%CI: 36, 97, per-protocol analysis). The third \nstudy, a field trial conducted in Peru, failed to show any protective efficacy against cholera during the \nfirst year. Following a booster dose 10-12 months after primary immunisation, the protective efficacy \nduring the second year was 60.5% (95%CI: 28,79).  \n \nProtective effectiveness against cholera was evaluated during two mass-vaccination campaigns \nconducted in Mozambique (December 2003 – January 2004) and Zanzibar (February 2009 – May \n2010).  \n \nIn the case-control study conducted during the mass vaccination campaign in Mozambique, protective \neffectiveness of 2 doses of Dukoral was 84% (95% CI: 43, 95, per-protocol analysis; p=0.005) for the \ninitial 5 months of follow-up.  \n \nIn the longitudinal cohort-analysis conducted during the mass-vaccination campaign in Zanzibar, \nprotective effectiveness after 2 doses of Dukoral was 79% (95% CI, 47, 92) for a follow-up period of \n15 months. In addition to the direct protection, it was shown that Dukoral provides significant indirect \n(herd) protection in the studied setting. \n \nProtective efficacy of Dukoral against cholera has not been studied following repeated booster \nvaccination. \n \nImmunogenicity \n\nNo established immunological correlates of protection against cholera after oral vaccination have \nbeen identified. There is a poor correlation between serum antibody responses, including vibriocidal \nantibody response, and protection. Locally produced secretory IgA antibodies in the intestine \nprobably mediate protective immunity. \n\nThe vaccine induced intestinal antitoxin IgA responses in 70-100% of vaccinated subjects. Serum \nvibriocidal antibodies against the bacterial components were seen in 35-55% of vaccinated subjects \nand antitoxic antibodies in 78-87% of vaccinated subjects. A booster dose elicited an anamnestic \nresponse indicative of an immune memory.

What Dukoral is and what it is used for \n \nDukoral is an oral vaccine against cholera that stimulates the immunological defence in the gut. The \nvaccine protects adults and children from 2 years of age against cholera.  \n \nDukoral causes your body to produce its own protection against cholera. After getting the vaccine, \nyour body will make substances called antibodies, which fight the cholera bacteria and toxin that \ncause diarrhoea.  \n \n2.

Check \nwith your doctor if you are not sure. \nAdults and children from 6 years of age: The primary vaccination is 2 doses taken orally (by mouth) \nat least 1 week (up to 6 weeks) apart.  \n\n• Take the 1st dose no later than 2 weeks before you leave for your trip. \n• Take the 2nd dose at least 1 week after the 1st dose and at least 1 week before your trip.  \n\nIt takes about 1 week after the last dose for protection to begin. \nFor continuous protection, re-vaccination is recommended within 2 years. If you had your last dose of \nvaccine less than 2 years ago a single dose will renew your protection. If more than 2 years have \npassed since you had the last vaccine dose, the primary vaccination (2 doses) should be repeated. \n \nChildren of 2 to below 6 years of age: The primary vaccination is 3 doses taken orally (by mouth) at \nleast 1 week (up to 6 weeks) apart. Only half of the amount of the buffer solution should be mixed \nwith the vaccine.  \n\n• Give the 1st dose to the child no later than 3 weeks before you leave for your trip.  \n• Give the 2nd dose to the child at least 1 week after the 1st dose.  \n• Give the 3rd dose at least one week after the 2nd dose and at least one week before your trip. \n\n \nIt takes about 1 week after the last dose for protection to begin. \nFor continuous protection, re-vaccination is recommended within 6 months. If less than 6 months \nhave passed since the last vaccination a single dose will renew the protection. If more than 6 months \nhave passed since the last vaccination, the primary vaccination (3 doses) should be repeated. \n \nThe suspensionsupplied in a single-dose glass vial is a whitish suspension.. Each vial comes with one \nsachet package that contains white effervescent granules of sodium hydrogen carbonate.  The \neffervescent granules should be dissolved in a glass of cool water, and the resulting buffer solution \nshould be mixed with the suspension. It is important to use the buffer solution, as it protects the \nvaccine from the gastric acid. \n \nDrink the entire mixture within 2 hours after mixing with the buffer solution. \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \nInstructions for use: \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nIf you take more Dukoral than you should \nIf you take the doses less than one week apart, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \nBecause each vial of Dukoral contains only one dose, overdosage is unlikely.  \nIf you have taken more than one dose at one time, please contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you forget to take Dukoral. \nYou can take the 2nd dose of Dukoral up to 6 weeks after the 1st dose (children of 2 to below 6 years \nhave to take 3 doses).
