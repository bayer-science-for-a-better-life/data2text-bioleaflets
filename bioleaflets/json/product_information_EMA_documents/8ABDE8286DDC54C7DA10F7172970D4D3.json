NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva 50 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 50 mg ibandronic acid (as sodium monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nWhite, biconvex, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets, engraved “50” on one side and plain on the \nother. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva is indicated in adults for the prevention of skeletal events (pathological \nfractures, bone complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast cancer and \nbone metastases. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva therapy should only be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of \ncancer. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one 50 mg film-coated tablet daily. \n \nSpecial populations \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr ≥50 and <80 mL/min).  \n \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥30 and <50 mL/min) a dosage adjustment to one \n50 mg film-coated tablet every second day is recommended (see section 5.2).  \n \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) the recommended dose is one 50 mg \nfilm-coated tablet once weekly. See dosing instructions, above. \n \nElderly population (> 65 years)  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ibandronic Acid Teva in children and adolescents below the age of \n18 years have not been established. No data are available. (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva tablets should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and before the \nfirst food or drink of the day. Medicinal products and supplements (including calcium) should \nsimilarly be avoided prior to taking Ibandronic Acid Teva tablets. Fasting should be continued for at \nleast 30 minutes after taking the tablet. Water may be taken at any time during the course of \nIbandronic Acid Teva treatment (see section 4.5). Water with a high concentration of calcium should \nnot be used. If there is concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard \nwater), it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. \n \n- The tablets should be swallowed whole with a full glass of water (180 to 240 ml) while the \n\npatient is standing or sitting in an upright position. \n \n- Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \n- Patients should not chew , suck or crush the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal \n\nulceration. \n \n- Water is the only drink that should be taken with Ibandronic Acid Teva.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Hypocalcaemia \n- Abnormalities of the oesophagus which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or \n\nachalasia \n- Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients with disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism  \nHypocalcaemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated \nbefore starting Ibandronic Acid Teva therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important \nin all patients. Patients should receive supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D if dietary intake is \ninadequate. \n \nGastrointestinal irritation \nOrally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. \nBecause of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, \ncaution should be used when Ibandronic Acid Teva is given to patients with active upper \ngastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett’s oesophagus, dysphagia, other oesophageal diseases, \ngastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). \n \nAdverse experiences such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, in some \ncases severe and requiring hospitalization, rarely with bleeding or followed by oesophageal stricture \nor perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk \nof severe oesophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with \nthe dosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms \nsuggestive of oesophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention and be able to comply \nwith the dosing instructions (see section 4.2). \nPhysicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible oesophageal reaction and \npatients should be instructed to discontinue Ibandronic Acid Teva and seek medical attention if they \ndevelop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nWhile no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing \nreports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with \ncomplications. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs \nSince acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and \nbisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during \nconcomitant administration. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post-marketing setting in patients \nreceiving Ibandronic Acid Teva for oncology indications (see section 4.8). \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. \n \nA dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is \nrecommended prior to treatment with Ibandronic Acid Teva in patients with concomitant risk factors. \n \nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: \n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions. \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with Ibandronic Acid Teva. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to \nIbandronic Acid Teva administration. \n \nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration \nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary \ninterruption of Ibandronic Acid Teva treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and \ncontributing risk factors are mitigated where possible. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur  \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore \nthe contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nDiscontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture \nshould be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk \nassessment. \n \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nRenal function \nClinical studies have not shown any evidence of deterioration in renal function with long term \nibandronic acid therapy. Nevertheless, according to clinical assessment of the individual patient, it is \nrecommended that renal function, serum calcium, phosphate and magnesium should be monitored in \npatients treated with Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nPatients with known hypersensitivity to other bisphosphonates \nCaution is to be taken in patients with known hypersensitivity to other bisphosphonates. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMedicinal product-Food Interactions \nProducts containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron), \nincluding milk and food, are likely to interfere with absorption of Ibandronic Acid Teva tablets. \nTherefore, with such products, including food, intake must be delayed at least 30 minutes following \noral administration. \n \nBioavailability was reduced by approximately 75% when ibandronic acid tablets were administered \n2 hours after a standard meal. Therefore, it is recommended that the tablets should be taken after an \novernight fast (at least 6 hours) and fasting should continue for at least 30 minutes after the dose has \nbeen taken (see section 4.2). \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \nMetabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major \nhuman hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 \nsystem in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not \nundergo any biotransformation. \n \nH2-antagonists or other medicinal products that increase gastric pH. \nIn healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous ranitidine caused an increase in \nibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20% (which is within the normal variability of the \nbioavailability of ibandronic acid), probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, no \ndosage adjustment is required when Ibandronic Acid Teva is administered with H2-antagonists or  \nmedicinal products that increase gastric pH. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs \nSince acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and \nbisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during \nconcomitant administration (see section 4.4). \n \nAminoglycosides \nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since both \nsubstances can lower serum calcium levels for prolonged periods. Attention should also be paid to the \npossible existence of simultaneous hypomagnesaemia. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, \nIbandronic Acid Teva should not be used during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have \ndemonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous \nadministration. Ibandronic Acid Teva should not be used during lactation. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid in humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the \noral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, \nibandronic acid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it \nis expected that Ibandronic Acid Teva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the \nfemur, osteonecrosis of the jaw, gastrointestinal irritation, and ocular inflammation (see paragraph \n“Description of selected adverse reactions” and section 4.4). Treatment was most frequently \nassociated with a decrease in serum calcium to below normal range (hypocalcaemia), followed by \ndyspepsia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions from 2 pivotal phase III studies (Prevention of skeletal events in \npatients with breast cancer and bone metastases: 286 patients treated with ibandronic acid 50 mg \nadministered orally), and from post-marketing experience.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. \nFrequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (>1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1 Adverse Drug Reactions Reported for Oral Administration of Ibandronic Acid \n \nSystem \nOrgan Class \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Anaemia    \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n   Hypersensitivi\nty†, \nbronchospasm\n†, \nangioedema†, \nanaphylactic \nreaction/shock\n†* \n\nAsthma \nexacerbation \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypocalcaemi\na* \n\n    \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Paraesthesia, \ndysgeusia \n(taste \nperversion) \n\n   \n\nEye disorders   Ocular \ninflammation†\n* \n\n  \n\nGastrointesti\nnal disorders \n\nOesophagitis, \nabdominal \npain, \ndyspepsia, \nnausea \n\nHaemorrhage, \nduodenal \nulcer, gastritis, \ndysphagia, dry \nmouth \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n Pruritus  Stevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome†, \nerythema \nmultiforme†, \ndermatitis \nbullous† \n\n \n\nMusculoskele\ntal and \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n  Atypical \nsubtrochanteri\nc and \ndiaphyseal \nfemoral \nfractures† \n\nOsteonecrosis \nof jaw†*, \nosteonecrosis \nof the external \nauditory canal \n(bisphosphona\nte class \nadverse \nreaction)† \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n Azotaemia \n(uraemia) \n\n   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nn site \nconditions \n\nAsthenia Chest pain, \ninfluenza-like \nillness, \nmalaise, pain \n\n   \n\nInvestigations  Blood \nparathyroid \nhormone \nincreased \n\n   \n\n*See further information below \n†Identified in postmarketing experience. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypocalcaemia \nDecreased renal calcium excretion may be accompanied by a fall in serum phosphate levels not \nrequiring therapeutic measures.

In some cases, these events did not resolve until the ibandronic acid was \ndiscontinued. \n \nAnaphylactic reaction/shock \nCases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated \nwith intravenous ibandronic acid. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Ibandronic Acid Teva. \nHowever, oral overdosage may result in upper gastrointestinal events, such as upset stomach, \nheartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcer. Milk or antacids should be given to bind Ibandronic Acid \nTeva. Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should \nremain fully upright. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonate, ATC \nCode: M05BA06 \n \nIbandronic acid belongs to the bisphosphonate group of compounds which act specifically on bone. \nTheir selective action on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of bisphosphonates for bone \nmineral. Bisphosphonates act by inhibiting osteoclast activity, although the precise mechanism is still \nnot clear. \n \nIn vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally-induced bone destruction caused by cessation of \ngonadal function, retinoids, tumours or tumour extracts. The inhibition of endogenous bone resorption \nhas also been documented by 45Ca kinetic studies and by the release of radioactive tetracycline \npreviously incorporated into the skeleton. \n \nAt doses that were considerably higher than the pharmacologically effective doses, ibandronic acid \ndid not have any effect on bone mineralisation. \n \nBone resorption due to malignant disease is characterized by excessive bone resorption that is not \nbalanced with appropriate bone formation. Ibandronic acid selectively inhibits osteoclast activity, \nreducing bone resorption and thereby reducing skeletal complications of the malignant disease. \n \nClinical studies in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases have shown that there is a dose \ndependent inhibitory effect on bone osteolysis, expressed by markers of bone resorption, and a dose \ndependent effect on skeletal events. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPrevention of skeletal events in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases with ibandronic acid \n50 mg tablets was assessed in two randomized placebo controlled phase III trials with a duration of \n96 weeks. Female patients with breast cancer and radiologically confirmed bone metastases were \nrandomised to receive placebo (277 patients) or 50 mg ibandronic acid (287 patients). The results \nfrom these trials are summarised below. \n \nPrimary efficacy endpoints \nThe primary endpoint of the trials was the skeletal morbidity period rate (SMPR). This was a \ncomposite endpoint which had the following skeletal related events (SREs) as sub-components: \n \n- radiotherapy to bone for treatment of fractures/impending fractures, \n- surgery to bone for treatment of fractures, \n- vertebral fractures, \n- non-vertebral fractures. \n \nThe analysis of the SMPR was time-adjusted and considered that one or more events occurring in a \nsingle 12 week period could be potentially related. Multiple events were therefore, counted only once \nin any given 12 week period for the purposes of the analysis. Pooled data from these studies \ndemonstrated a significant advantage for ibandronic acid 50 mg p.o. over placebo in the reduction in \nSREs measured by the SMPR (p=0.041). There was also a 38% reduction in the risk of developing an \nSRE for ibandronic acid treated patients when compared with placebo (relative risk 0.62, p=0.003). \nEfficacy results are summarised in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Efficacy Results (Breast Cancer Patients with Metastatic Bone Disease)  \n \n\n All Skeletal Related Events (SREs) \nPlacebo  \nn=277 \n\nIbandronic acid 50 mg \nn=287 \n\np-value \n\nSMPR (per patient year) 1.15 0.99 p=0.041 \n\nSRE relative risk - 0.62 p=0.003 \n\n \nSecondary efficacy endpoints  \nA statistically significant improvement in bone pain score was shown for ibandronic acid 50 mg \ncompared to placebo. The pain reduction was consistently below baseline throughout the entire study \nand accompanied by a significantly reduced use of analgesics compared to placebo. The deterioration \nin Quality of Life and WHO performance status was significantly less in ibandronic acid treated \npatients compared with placebo. Urinary concentrations of the bone resorption marker CTx \n(C-terminal telopeptide released from Type I collagen) were significantly reduced in the ibandronic \nacid group compared to placebo. This reduction in urinary CTx levels was significantly correlated \nwith the primary efficacy endpoint SMPR (Kendall-tau-b (p<0.001)). A tabular summary of the \nsecondary efficacy results is presented in Table 3. \n \nTable 3 Secondary Efficacy Results (Breast Cancer Patients with Metastatic Bone Disease) \n \n\n Placebo n=277 \nIbandronic acid 50 mg \n\nn=287 \np-value \n\nBone pain *  0.20 -0.10 p=0.001 \n\nAnalgesic use *  0.85 0.60 p=0.019 \n\nQuality of Life *  -26.8 -8.3 p=0.032 \n\n\n\n10 \n\nWHO performance \nscore *  \n\n0.54 0.33 p=0.008 \n\nUrinary CTx **  10.95 -77.32 p=0.001 \n\n* Mean change from baseline to last assessment. \n** Median change from baseline to last assessment \n \nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2) \nThe safety and efficacy of Ibandronic Acid Teva in children and adolescents below the age of 18 \nyears have not been established. No data are available. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration. \nMaximum observed plasma concentrations were reached within 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in the \nfasted state and absolute bioavailability was about 0.6%. The extent of absorption is impaired when \ntaken together with food or beverages (other than water). Bioavailability is reduced by about 90% \nwhen ibandronic acid is administered with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability \nseen in fasted subjects. When taken 30 minutes before a meal, the reduction in bioavailability is \napproximately 30%. There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is \ntaken 60 minutes before a meal. \n \nBioavailability was reduced by approximately 75% when ibandronic acid tablets were administered \n2 hours after a standard meal. Therefore, it is recommended that the tablets should be taken after an \novernight fast (minimum 6 hours) and fasting should continue for at least 30 minutes after the dose \nhas been taken (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nAfter initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In \nhumans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching \nthe bone is estimated to be 40-50% of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is \napproximately 87% at therapeutic concentrations, and thus interaction with other medicinal products, \ndue to displacement is unlikely. \n \nBiotransformation \nThere is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolized in animals or humans. \n \nElimination \nThe absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption \n(estimated to be 40-50%) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney. The unabsorbed \nfraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces. \n \nThe range of observed apparent half-lives is broad and dependent on dose and assay sensitivity, but \nthe apparent terminal half-life is generally in the range of 10-60 hours. However, early plasma levels \nfall quickly, reaching 10% of peak values within 3 and 8 hours after intravenous or oral \nadministration respectively. \n \nTotal clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84-160 ml/min. Renal \nclearance (about 60 ml/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50-60% of total \nclearance and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal \nclearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone. \n \nThe secretory pathway of renal elimination does not appear to include known acidic or basic transport \nsystems involved in the excretion of other active substances In addition, ibandronic acid does not \n\n\n\n11 \n\ninhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 \nsystem in rats. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nGender  \nBioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in both men and women. \n \nRace \nThere is no evidence for clinically relevant interethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians in \nibandronic acid disposition. There are only very few data available on patients with African origin. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nExposure to ibandronic acid in patients with various degree of renal impairment is related to \ncreatinine clearance (CLcr). Subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr ≤ 30 mL/min) receiving \noral administration of 10 mg ibandronic acid daily for 21 days, had 2-3 fold higher plasma \nconcentrations than subjects with normal renal function (CLcr ≥80 mL/min). Total clearance of \nibandronic acid was reduced to 44 ml/min in the subjects with severe renal impairment compared with \n129 mL/min in subjects with normal renal function.No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients \nwith mild renal impairment (CLcr ≥50 and <80 mL/min). For patients with moderate renal impairment \n(CLcr ≥30 and <50 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) an adjustment in the \ndose is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The \nliver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid since it is not metabolized but is \ncleared by renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dosage adjustment is not necessary in \npatients with hepatic impairment. Further, as protein binding of ibandronic acid is approximately 87% \nat therapeutic concentrations, hypoproteinaemia in severe liver disease is unlikely to lead to clinically \nsignificant increases in free plasma concentration. \n \nElderly (see section 4.2) \nIn a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the \npharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age, this is the only factor to \ntake into consideration (see renal impairment section). \n \nPaediatric population (see sections 4.2 and 5.1) \nThere are no data on the use of ibandronic acid in patients less than 18 years old. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures sufficiently in excess of the maximum \nhuman exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. As with other bisphosphonates, the kidney \nwas identified to be the primary target organ of systemic toxicity. \n \nMutagenicity/Carcinogenicity: \nNo indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of \ngenetic activity for ibandronic acid. \n \nReproductive toxicity: \nNo evidence of direct foetal toxicity or teratogenic effects was observed for ibandronic acid in \nintravenously or orally treated rats and rabbits. In reproductive studies in rats by the oral route effects \non fertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of 1 mg/kg/day and higher. In \nreproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid decreased sperm counts at doses \nof 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 mg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 \nmg/kg/day. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those \n\n\n\n12 \n\nexpected for this class of medicinal products (bisphosphonates). They include a decreased number of \nimplantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), an increase in visceral variations \n(renal pelvis ureter syndrome) and teeth abnormalities in F1 offspring in rats. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg ibandronic acid (as sodium monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nWhite, biconvex, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets, engraved “I150” on one side and plain on the \nother. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1).  \nA reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck \nfractures has not been established. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably \nbe taken on the same date each month. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and 1 hour before the \nfirst food or drink (other than water) of the day (see section 4.5) or any other oral medicinal products \nor supplementation (including calcium). \n \nIn case a dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Ibandronic Acid Teva 150 mg tablet \nthe morning after the tablet is remembered, unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within \n7 days. Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled \ndate. If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then \ncontinue taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled. Patients should not take two tablets \nwithin the same week. \n \nPatients should receive supplemental calcium and / or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nThe optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need \nfor continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks \nof Ibandronic Acid Teva on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIbandronic Acid Teva is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min \ndue to limited clinical experience (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine \nclearance is equal or greater than 30 ml/min.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population (>65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Ibandronic Acid Teva in children below 18 years, and Ibandronic Acid \nTeva was not studied in this population (see section 5.1 and section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \n \n- Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is \n\nsitting or standing in an upright position. Water with a high concentration of calcium should not \nbe used. If there is a concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard \nwater), it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. \n\n- Patients should not lie down for 1 hour after taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n- Water is the only drink that should be taken with Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n- Patients should not chew or suck the tablet, because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Hypocalcaemia \n- Abnormalities of the oesophagus which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or \n\nachalasia \n- Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypocalcaemia \nExisting hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Ibandronic Acid Teva therapy. Other \ndisturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated. Adequate intake of \ncalcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. \n \nGastrointestinal irritation \nOrally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. \nBecause of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, \ncaution should be used when Ibandronic Acid Teva is given to patients with active upper \ngastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett’s oesophagus, dysphagia, other oesophageal diseases, \ngastritis, duodenitis or ulcers).  \nAdverse reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, in some cases \nsevere and requiring hospitalisation, rarely with bleeding or followed by oesophageal stricture or \nperforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of \nsevere oesophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the \ndosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms \nsuggestive of oesophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention to and be able to comply \nwith the dosing instructions (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPhysicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible oesophageal reaction and \npatients should be instructed to discontinue Ibandronic Acid Teva and seek medical attention if they \ndevelop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. \n \nWhile no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing \nreports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with \ncomplications. \n \nSince Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products and bisphosphonates are both associated \nwith gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant administration. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post-marketing setting in patients \nreceiving Ibandronic Acid Teva for osteoporosis (see section 4.8). \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. \n \nA dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is \nrecommended prior to treatment with Ibandronic Acid Teva in patients with concomitant risk factors. \n \nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: \n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions. \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with Ibandronic Acid Teva. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to \nIbandronic Acid Teva administration. \n \nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration \nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary \ninterruption of Ibandronic Acid Teva treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and \ncontributing risk factors are mitigated where possible. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur  \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore \n\n\n\n17 \n\nthe contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment.  \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nRenal impairment \nDue to limited clinical experience, Ibandronic Acid Teva is not recommended for patients with a \ncreatinine clearance below 30 ml/min (see section 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMedicinal product-Food Interaction  \nOral bioavailability of ibandronic acid is generally reduced in the presence of food. In particular, \nproducts containing calcium, including milk and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, \nmagnesium, iron), are likely to interfere with absorption of Ibandronic Acid Teva, which is consistent \nwith findings in animal studies. Therefore, patients should fast overnight (at least 6 hours) before \ntaking Ibandronic Acid Teva and continue fasting for 1 hour following intake of Ibandronic Acid \nTeva (see section 4.2). \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \nMetabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major \nhuman hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 \nsystem in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not \nundergo any biotransformation.  \n \nCalcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations \nCalcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations (such \nas aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Ibandronic Acid Teva. \nTherefore, patients should not take other oral medicinal products for at least 6 hours before taking \nIbandronic Acid Teva and for 1 hour following intake of Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs \nSince Acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and \nbisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during \nconcomitant administration (see section 4.4). \n \nH2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors \nOf over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of \nibandronic acid, 14% and 18% of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors \nafter one and two years, respectively. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal \nevents in the patients treated with ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients \ntreated with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. \n \nIn healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous administration of ranitidine \ncaused an increase in ibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20%, probably as a result of reduced \ngastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal variability of the bioavailability of \nibandronic acid, no dose adjustment is considered necessary when Ibandronic Acid Teva is \nadministered with H2-antagonists or other active substances which increase gastric pH. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nIbandronic Acid Teva is only for use in postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women of \nchildbearing potential. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have \nshown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nIbandronic Acid Teva should not be used during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have \ndemonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous \nadministration. Ibandronic Acid Teva should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid from humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the \noral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, \nibandronic acid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it \nis expected that Ibandronic Acid Teva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the \nfemur, osteonecrosis of the jaw, gastrointestinal irritation, ocular inflammation, (see paragraph \n“Description of selected adverse reactions” and section 4.4). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are arthralgia and influenza-like symptoms. These \nsymptoms are typically in association with the first dose, generally of short duration, mild or moderate \nin intensity, and usually resolve during continuing treatment without requiring remedial measures (see \nparagraph “Influenza like illness”). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn table 1 a complete list of known adverse reactions is presented. The safety of oral treatment with \nibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated in 4 placebo-controlled clinical \nstudies, with the large majority of patients coming from the pivotal three year fracture study (MF \n4411). \n \nIn a two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM 16549) the overall safety of \nibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly and ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was similar. The overall \nproportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction, was 22.7 % and 25.0 % for ibandronic \nacid 150 mg once monthly after one and two years, respectively. Most cases did not lead to cessation \nof therapy. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. \nFrequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (>1/10),  common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000),very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions occurring in postmenopausal women receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg \nonce monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in the phase III studies BM 16549 and MF 4411 and in \npost-marketing experience. \n \nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\n\n\n19 \n\nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Asthma \nexacerbation \n\nHypersensitivity \nreaction \n\nAnaphylactic \nreaction/shock*\n† \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness   \n\nEye disorders   Ocular \ninflammation*† \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders* \n\nOesophagitis, \nGastritis, \nGastro \noesophageal \nreflux \ndisease, \nDyspepsia, \nDiarrhoea, \nAbdominal \npain, Nausea \n\nOesophagitis \nincluding \noesophageal \nulcerations or \nstrictures and \ndysphagia, \nVomiting, \nFlatulence \n\nDuodenitis  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissues disorders \n\nRash  Angioedema, Face \noedema, Urticaria \n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome†, \nErythema \nmultiforme†, \nDermatitis \nbullous† \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue  \ndisorders \n\nArthralgia, \nMyalgia, \nMusculoskele\ntal pain, \nMuscle \ncramp, \nMusculoskele\ntal stiffness \n\nBack pain Atypical \nsubtrochanteric and \ndiaphyseal femoral \nfractures† \n\nOsteonecrosis of \njaw*†, \nOsteonecrosis of \nthe external \nauditory canal \n(bisphosphonate \nclass adverse \nreaction)† \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInfluenza like \nillness* \n\nFatigue   \n\n*See further information below \n†Identified in post-marketing experience. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nPatients with a previous history of gastrointestinal disease including patients with peptic ulcer without \nrecent bleeding or hospitalisation, and patients with dyspepsia or reflux controlled by medication \nwere included in the once monthly treatment study. For these patients, there was no difference in the \nincidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events with the 150 mg once monthly regimen compared \nto the 2.5 mg daily regimen. \n \nInfluenza-like illness \nInfluenza-like illness includes events reported as acute phase reaction or symptoms including myalgia, \narthralgia, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, or bone pain. \n \nOsteonecrosis of jaw \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as ibandronic acid (see section 4.4.) Cases of \nONJ have been reported in the post-marketing setting for ibandronic acid. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nOcular inflammation \nOcular inflammation events such as uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis have been reported with \nibandronic acid. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the ibandronic acid was \ndiscontinued. \n \nAnaphylactic reaction/shock \nCases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated \nwith intravenous ibandronic acid. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Ibandronic Acid Teva. \nHowever, based on a knowledge of this class of compounds, oral overdose may result in upper \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions (such as upset stomach, dyspepsia, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer) \nor hypocalcaemia. Milk or antacids should be given to bind Ibandronic Acid Teva, and any adverse \nreactions treated symptomatically. Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be \ninduced and the patient should remain fully upright. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, \nATC code: M05-BA06 \n \nMechanism of action \nIbandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of \nbisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity \nwithout directly affecting bone formation. It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. Ibandronic \nacid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the \nreduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic \nacid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, \nretinoids, tumours or tumour extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is \nalso inhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals. Animal \nmodels confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In growing \nrats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose \nrequired for osteoporosis treatment. \n \nBoth daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs \nand monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or \nincreased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range. In humans, the efficacy of both daily \nand intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9-10 weeks of ibandronic acid was \nconfirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\nIn animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent \ninhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen \ndegradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)). \n \nIn a Phase 1 bioequivalence study conducted in 72 postmenopausal women receiving 150 mg orally \nevery 28 days for a total of four doses, inhibition in serum CTX following the first dose was seen as \nearly as 24 hours post-dose (median inhibition 28 %), with median maximal inhibition (69 %) seen \n6 days later. Following the third and fourth dose, the median maximum inhibition 6 days post dose \nwas 74 % with reduction to a median inhibition of 56 % seen 28 days following the fourth dose. With \nno further dosing, there is a loss of suppression of biochemical markers of bone resorption. \n \nClinical efficacy \nIndependent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family \nhistory of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to \nidentify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. \n \nIbandronic acid 150 mg once monthly \n \nBone mineral density (BMD) \nIbandronic acid 150 mg once monthly was shown to be at least as effective as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg \ndaily at increasing BMD in a two year, double-blind, multicentre study (BM 16549) of \npostmenopausal women with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T score below -2.5 SD at baseline). \nThis was demonstrated in both the primary analysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at \ntwo years endpoint (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Mean relative change from baseline of lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and trochanter \nBMD after one year (primary analysis) and two years of treatment (Per-Protocol Population) in study \nBM 16549. \n \n One year data in study BM 16549 Two year data in study BM \n\n16549 \nMean relative changes \nfrom baseline % [95 % \nCI] \n\nIbandronic acid \n2.5 mg daily \n(N=318) \n\nIbandronic acid \n150 mg once \nmonthly \n(N=320) \n\nIbandronic \nacid 2.5 mg \ndaily (N=294) \n\nIbandronic \nacid 150 mg \nonce monthly \n(N=291) \n\nLumbar spine L2-L4 \nBMD  \n\n3.9 [3.4, 4.3] 4.9 [4.4, 5.3] 5.0 [4.4, 5.5] 6.6 [6.0, 7.1] \n\nTotal hip BMD  2.0 [1.7, 2.3] 3.1 [2.8, 3.4] 2.5 [2.1, 2.9] 4.2 [3.8, 4.5] \n\nFemoral neck BMD  1.7 [1.3, 2.1] 2.2 [1.9, 2.6] 1.9 [1.4, 2.4] 3.1 [2.7, 3.6] \n\nTrochanter BMD  3.2 [2.8, 3.7] 4.6 [4.2, 5.1] 4.0 [3.5, 4.5] 6.2 [5.7, 6.7] \n\n \nFurthermore, ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly was proven superior to ibandronic acid 2.5 mg \ndaily for increases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, p=0.002, and \nat two years, p<0.001. \n \nAt one year (primary analysis), 91.3 % (p=0.005) of patients receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg once \nmonthly had a lumbar spine BMD increase above or equal to baseline (BMD responders), compared \nwith 84.0 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. At two years, 93.5 % (p=0.004) and \n86.4 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, \nrespectively, were responders. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nFor total hip BMD, 90.0 % (p<0.001) of patients receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly and \n76.7 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases above or equal \nto baseline at one year. At two years 93.4 % (p<0.001) of patients receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg \nonce monthly and 78.4 %, of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD \nincreases above or equal to baseline. \n \nWhen a more stringent criterion is considered, which combines both lumbar spine and total hip BMD, \n83.9 % (p<0.001) and 65.7 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly or \nibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, respectively, were responders at one year. At two years, 87.1 % \n(p<0.001) and 70.5 %,of patients met this criterion in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms \nrespectively. \n \nBiochemical markers of bone turn-over \nClinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured, i.e. \nmonths 3, 6, 12 and 24. After one year (primary analysis) the median relative change from baseline \nwas -76 % for ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly and -67 % for ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. At \ntwo years the median relative change was -68 % and -62 %, in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily \narms respectively. \n \nAt one year, 83.5 % (p= 0.006) of patients receiving ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly and \n73.9 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily were identified as responders (defined as a \ndecrease ≥50% from baseline). At two years 78.7 % (p=0.002) and 65.6 % of patients were identified \nas responders in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively. \n \nBased on the results of study BM 16549, ibandronic acid 150 mg once monthly is expected to be at \nleast as effective in preventing fractures as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. \n \nIbandronic acid 2.5 mg daily \n \nIn the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a \nstatistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic \nmorphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 3). In this study, ibandronic \nacid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen. \nIbandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting \nperiod). The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, \nwho had a BMD at lumbar spine of 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one \nvertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures. All patients received 500 mg \ncalcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients. Ibandronic acid 2.5 mg \nadministered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the incidence \nof new vertebral fractures. This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic vertebral \nfractures by 62 % (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study. A relative risk reduction of \n61 % was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006). No statistically significant difference was attained after \n1 year of treatment (p=0.056). The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration of the study. \nThere was no indication of a waning of the effect over time. The incidence of clinical vertebral \nfractures was also significantly reduced by 49 % (p=0.011). The strong effect on vertebral fractures \nwas furthermore reflected by a statistically significant reduction of height loss compared to placebo \n(p<0.0001). \n \nTable 3: Results from 3 years fracture study MF 4411 (%, 95 % CI) \n \n Placebo  \n\n(N=974) \nIbandronic acid 2.5 mg daily \n(N=977) \n\nRelative Risk Reduction  \nNew morphometric vertebral \nfractures  \n\n 62 % (40.9, 75.1) \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIncidence of new morphometric \nvertebral fractures  \n\n9.56 % (7.5, 11.7) 4.68 % (3.2,6.2) \n\nRelative risk reduction of clinical \nvertebral fracture  \n\n 49 % (14.03, 69.49) \n\nIncidence of clinical vertebral \nfracture  \n\n5.33 % (3.73, 6.92) 2.75 % (1.61, 3.89) \n\nBMD – mean change relative to \nbaseline lumbar spine at year 3 \n\n1.26 % (0.8, 1.7) 6.54 % (6.1, 7.0) \n\nBMD – mean change relative to \nbaseline total hip at year 3 \n\n-0.69 % (-1.0, -0.4) 3.36 % (3.0, 3.7) \n\n \nThe treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of \npatients who at baseline had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below –2.5.

Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8 % at the femoral neck, 3.4 % at the total \nhip, and 5.5 % at the trochanter. Biochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and \nserum Osteocalcin) showed the expected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached \nmaximum suppression within a period of 3-6 months. A clinically meaningful reduction of 50 % of \nbiochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as early as one month after start of treatment \nwith ibandronic acid 2.5 mg. Following treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the \npathological pre-treatment rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal \nosteoporosis. The histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of \npostmenopausal women showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralization defect. \n \nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2) \nIbandronic acid was not studied in the paediatric population, therefore no efficacy or safety data are \navailable for this patient population. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual \nplasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans. \n \nAbsorption \nThe absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration \nand plasma concentrations increase in a dose-proportional manner up to 50 mg oral intake, with \ngreater than dose-proportional increases seen above this dose. Maximum observed plasma \nconcentrations were reached within 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in the fasted state and absolute \nbioavailability was about 0.6 %. The extent of absorption is impaired when taken together with food \nor beverages (other than  water). Bioavailability is reduced by about 90 % when ibandronic acid is \nadministered with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability seen in fasted subjects. \nThere is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is taken 60 minutes \nbefore the first food of the day. Both bioavailability and BMD gains are reduced when food or \nbeverage is taken less than 60 minutes after ibandronic acid is ingested. \n \nDistribution \nAfter initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In \nhumans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching \nthe bone is estimated to be 40-50 % of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is \napproximately 85 %-87 % (determined in vitro at therapeutic concentrations), and thus there is a low \npotential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement. \n \nBiotransformation \nThere is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans. \n \nElimination \nThe absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption \n(estimated to be 40-50% in postmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by \nthe kidney. The unabsorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces. \n \nThe range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the \nrange of 10-72 hours. As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the dose \nused, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in common \nwith other bisphosphonates. Early plasma levels fall quickly reaching 10 % of peak values within 3 \nand 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration respectively. \n \nTotal clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84-160 ml/min. Renal \nclearance (about 60 ml/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50-60 % of total \nclearance and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal \nclearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone. \n \nThe secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the \nexcretion of other active substances. In addition, ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human \nhepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special clinical situations \n \nGender \nBioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women. \n \nRace \nThere is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and \nCaucasians in ibandronic acid disposition. There are few data available on patients of African origin. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \nRenal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly \nrelated to creatinine clearance. \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or \ngreater than 30 ml/min), as shown in study BM 16549 where the majority of patients had mild to \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nSubjects with severe renal failure (CLcr less than 30 ml/min) receiving daily oral administration of \n10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2-3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with \nnormal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/min. After intravenous \nadministration of 0.5 mg, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67 %, 77 % and 50 %, \nrespectively, in subjects with severe renal failure but there was no reduction in tolerability associated \nwith the increase in exposure. Due to the limited clinical experience, ibandronic acid is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). The \npharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid was not assessed in patients with end-stage renal disease \nmanaged by other than hemodialysis. The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in these patients is \nunknown, and ibandronic acid should not be used under these circumstances. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The \nliver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid which is not metabolised but is cleared \nby renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly population (see section 4.2) \nIn a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the \npharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age this is the only factor to \ntake into consideration (see renal impairment section). \n \nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.1) \nThere are no data on the use of ibandronic acid in these age groups. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxic effects, e.g signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered \nsufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nMutagenicity/Carcinogenicity \nNo indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of \ngenetic activity for ibandronic acid. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nThere was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in orally \ntreated rats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats at \nan extrapolated exposure of at least 35 times above human exposure. In reproductive studies in rats by \nthe oral route effects on fertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of 1 \nmg/kg/day and higher. In reproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid \ndecreased sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 \nmg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive \ntoxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a \ndecreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase \nin visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome). \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nIbandronic Acid Teva 50 mg film-coated tablets \nibandronic acid \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If  you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What  Ibandronic Acid Teva is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n3. How to take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ibandronic Acid Teva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ibandronic Acid Teva is and what it is used for  \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva contains the active substance ibandronic acid. This belongs to a group of \nmedicines called bisphosphonates. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva is used in adults and prescribed to you if you have breast cancer that has spread \nto your bones (called bone “metastases”). \n \n• It helps to prevent your bones from breaking (fractures). \n• It also helps to prevent other bone problems that may need surgery or radiotherapy. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva works by reducing the amount of calcium that is lost from your bones. This \nhelps to stop your bones from getting weaker. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n \nDo not take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n• if you are allergic to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine that are listed \n\nin section 6 \n• if you have problems with your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus) such as narrowing or difficulty \n\nswallowing \n• if you cannot stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time \n• if you have or ever had low calcium in your blood. \n \nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n41 \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very \nrarely in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving Ibandronic Acid Teva for cancer-related \nconditions. ONJ can also occur after stopping treatment. \n \nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to \ntreat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions \nyou should take. \n \nBefore receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if:  \n- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction. \n- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time. \n- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems). \n- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders). \n- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone). \n- you have cancer. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Ibandronic \nAcid Teva. \n \nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and \nreceive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you \nare under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor \nabout your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of \nosteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ibandronic Acid Teva: \n - if you are allergic to any other bisphosphonates \n- if you have any swallowing or digestion problems \n- if you have high or low blood levels of vitamin D or any other minerals \n- if you have kidney problems. \n \nIrritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of \nsevere pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting \nmay occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of \ntaking Ibandronic Acid Teva. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Ibandronic Acid Teva and \ntell your doctor straight away (see sections 3 and 4). \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nIbandronic Acid Teva should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Ibandronic Acid Teva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Ibandronic Acid Teva can affect the way some other medicines work. Also \nsome other medicines can affect the way Ibandronic Acid Teva works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium \n- acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines called “NSAIDs”, such as \n\nibuprofen or naproxen. This is because NSAIDs and Ibandronic Acid Teva can both irritate your \nstomach and gut \n\n\n\n42 \n\n- a type of antibiotic injection called “aminoglycoside” such as gentamicin. This is because \naminoglycosides and Ibandronic Acid Teva can both lower the amount of calcium in your blood. \n\n \nTaking medicines that reduce stomach acid such as cimetidine and ranitidine, may slightly increase \nthe effects of Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva with food and drink \nDo not take Ibandronic Acid Teva with food or any other drinks except water as Ibandronic Acid \nTeva is less effective if it is taken with food or drink (see section 3).  \n \nTake Ibandronic Acid Teva with at least 6 hours after you had last had anything to eat, drink or any \nother medicines or supplements (e.g. products containing calcium (milk), aluminium, magnesium and \niron) except water. After taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. Then you can have your first \nfood and drink, and take any medicines or supplements (see section 3). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Ibandronic Acid Teva if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou can drive and use machines as it’s expected that Ibandronic Acid Teva has no or negligible effect \non your ability to drive and use machines. Talk to your doctor first if you want to drive, use machine \nor tools. \n \n \n3. How to take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nTake your tablet at least 6 hours after you had last had anything to eat, drink or any other medicines or \nsupplements except water. Water with a high concentration of calcium should not be used. If there is \nconcern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), it is advised to use \nbottled water with a low mineral content. \n \nYour doctor may do regular blood tests while you are taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. This is to check \nthat you are being given the right amount of medicine. \n \nTaking this medicine \nIt is important that you take Ibandronic Acid Teva at the right time and in the right way. This is \nbecause it can cause irritation, inflammation or ulcers in your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus). \n \nYou can help stop this happening by doing the following: \n \n• Take your tablet as soon as you get up for the day before having your first food, drink, any \n\nmedicine or supplements. \n \n• Take your tablet with a full glass of water only (about 200 mL). Do not take your tablet with \n\nany drink other than water. \n \n• Swallow the tablet whole. Do not chew, suck or crush the tablet. Do not let the tablet dissolve \n\nin your mouth. \n \n• After taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. Then you can have your first food and drink, \n\nand take any medicines or supplements. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n• Stay upright (sitting or standing) while taking your tablet and for the next hour (60 minutes). \n\nOtherwise, some of the medicine could leak back into your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus). \n \nHow much to take \nThe usual dose of Ibandronic Acid Teva is one tablet each day. If you have moderate kidney \nproblems, your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet every other day. If you have severe kidney \nproblems, your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet each week. \n \nIf you take more Ibandronic Acid Teva than you should \nIf you take too many tablets talk to a doctor or go to hospital straight away. Drink a full glass of milk \nbefore you go. Do not make yourself sick. Do not lie down. \n \nIf you forget to take Ibandronic Acid Teva \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are taking a tablet each day, skip the \nmissed dose completely. Then carry on as usual the next day. If you are taking a tablet every other day \nor once a week, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n \nIf you stop taking Ibandronic Acid Teva \nKeep taking Ibandronic Acid Teva for as long as your doctor tells you. This is because the medicine \nwill only work if it is taken all the time. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTalk to a nurse or a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects, \nyou may need urgent medical treatment: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• feeling sick, heartburn and discomfort in swallowing (inflammation of your gullet/food pipe) \n \nUncommon (may affect less than 1 in 100 people): \n• severe stomach pain. This could be a sign of an ulcer of the first section of the bowel \n\n(duodenum) that is bleeding, or that your stomach is inflamed (gastritis) \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n• persistent eye pain and inflammation \n• new pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin. You may have early signs of a \n\npossible unusual fracture of the thigh bone. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n• pain or sore in your mouth or jaw. You may have early signs of severe jaw problems (necrosis \n\n[dead bone tissue] in the jaw bone). \n• Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These \n\ncould be signs of bone damage in the ear. \n• itching, swelling of your face, lips, tongue and throat, with difficulty breathing. You may be \n\nhaving a serious, potentially life threatening allergic reaction. \n• severe adverse skin reactions. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n• asthma attack \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nOther possible side effects \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• tummy pain, indigestion \n• low calcium levels in your blood \n• weakness. \n \nUncommon (may affect less than 1 in 100 people): \n• chest pain \n• itching or tingling skin (paraesthesia) \n• flu-like symptoms, feeling generally unwell or in pain \n• dry mouth, strange taste in your mouth or difficulty swallowing \n• anaemia(bloodlessness) \n• high levels of urea or high levels of parathyroid hormone in your blood. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Content of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ibandronic Acid Teva is and what it is used for  \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates. It contains the active \nsubstance ibandronic acid. Ibandronic Acid Teva may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone \nand increasing bone mass in most women who take it, even though they will not be able to see or feel \na difference. Ibandronic Acid Teva may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). This \nreduction in fractures was shown for the spine but not for the hip. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva is prescribed to you to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis because you \nhave an increased risk of fractures. Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is \ncommon in women after the menopause. At the menopause, a woman’s ovaries stop producing the \nfemale hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy. \n \nThe earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis. \n \nOther things that can increase the risk of fractures include: \n- not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet, \n- smoking, or drinking too much alcohol, \n- not enough walking or other weight-bearing exercise, \n- a family history of osteoporosis. \n \nA healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment. This includes: \n- eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, \n- walking or any other weight-bearing exercise, \n- not smoking; and not drinking too much alcohol. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n \nDo not take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n\n\n\n48 \n\n- If you are allergic to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in \nsection 6. \n\n- If you have certain problems with your gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) such as narrowing or \ndifficulty swallowing. \n\n- If you can’t stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time. \n- If you have, or had in the past low blood calcium. Please consult your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very \nrarely in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving Ibandronic Acid Teva for osteoporosis. ONJ \ncan also occur after stopping treatment. \n \nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to \ntreat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions \nyou should take. \n \nBefore receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: \n- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction. \n- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time. \n- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems). \n- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders). \n- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone). \n- you have cancer. \n \nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Ibandronic \nAcid Teva. \n \nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and \nreceive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you \nare under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor \nabout your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of \nosteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nSome people need to be especially careful while they’re taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. Talk to your \ndoctor before taking Ibandronic Acid Teva: \n- If you have any disturbances of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency). \n- If your kidneys are not functioning normally. \n- If you have any swallowing or digestive problems. \n \nIrritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of \nsevere pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting \nmay occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of \ntaking Ibandronic Acid Teva. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Ibandronic Acid Teva and \ntell your doctor straight away (see section 3). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give Ibandronic Acid Teva to children or adolescents below 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Ibandronic Acid Teva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Especially: \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n- Supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium, as they could possibly \n\ninfluence the effects of Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n- Acetylsalicylic acid and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) (including \n\nibuprofen, diclofenac sodium and naproxen) may irritate the stomach and intestine. Ibandronic \nAcid Teva may also do so. So be especially careful if you take painkillers or \nanti-inflammatories while you’re taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n\n \nAfter swallowing your monthly Ibandronic Acid Teva tablet, wait for 1 hour before taking any \nother medication, including indigestion tablets, calcium supplements, or vitamins. \n \nIbandronic Acid Teva with food and drink \nDo not take Ibandronic Acid Teva with food. Ibandronic Acid Teva is less effective if it’s taken \nwith food. \n \nYou can drink water but no other drinks. \n \nAfter you have taken Ibandronic Acid Teva, please wait for 1 hour before you can have your first food \nand further drinks. (see 3. How to take Ibandronic Acid Teva). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIbandronic Acid Teva is for use only by postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women \nwho could still have a baby. \n \nDo not take Ibandronic Acid Teva if you are  pregnant or breast feeding. Ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou can drive and use machines as it’s  expected that Ibandronic Acid Teva  has no or negligible \neffect on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe usual dose of Ibandronic Acid Teva is one tablet once a month. \n \nTaking your monthly tablet \nIt’s important to follow these instructions carefully. They are designed to help your Ibandronic Acid \nTeva tablet reach your stomach quickly, so it’s less likely to cause irritation. \n \n- Take one Ibandronic Acid Teva 150 mg tablet once a month. \n- Choose one day of the month that will be easy to remember. You can choose either the same \n\ndate (such as the 1st of each month) or the same day (such as the first Sunday of each month) to \ntake your Ibandronic Acid Teva tablet. Choose the date that best fits your routine. \n\n- Take your Ibandronic Acid Teva tablet at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat or \ndrink except water. \n\n \n- Take your Ibandronic Acid Teva tablet \n\n- after you first get up for the day, and \n- before you have anything to eat or drink (on an empty stomach) \n \n\n- Swallow your tablet with a full glass of water (at least 180 ml). \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nDo not take your tablet with water with a high concentration of calcium, fruit juice or any other \ndrinks. If there is a concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), \nit is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. \n \n- Swallow your tablet whole, — do not chew it, crush it or let it dissolve in your mouth. \n \n- For the next hour (60 minutes) after you’ve taken your tablet \n\n- do not lie down; if you do not stay upright (standing or sitting), some of the medicine \ncould leak back into your oesophagus \n\n \n- do not eat anything \n\n \n- do not drink anything (except water if you need it) \n- do not take any other medicines \n \n\n- After you’ve waited for an hour, you can have your first food and drink of the day. Once you’ve \neaten, it’s OK to lie down if you wish, and to take any other medication you need. \n\n \nContinuing to take Ibandronic Acid Teva \nIt’s important to keep taking Ibandronic Acid Teva every month, as long as your doctor prescribes it \nfor you. After 5 years of  using Ibandronic Acid Teva, please consult with your doctor whether you \nshould continue to take Ibandronic Acid Teva. \n \nIf you take more Ibandronic Acid Teva than you should \nIf you’ve taken more than one tablet by mistake, drink a full glass of milk and talk to your doctor \nstraight away. \n \nDo not make yourself vomit, and do not lie down — this could cause Ibandronic Acid Teva to \nirritate your oesophagus. \n \nIf you forget to take Ibandronic Acid Teva \n- If you forget to take your tablet on the morning of your chosen day, do not take a tablet later \n\nin the day. \nInstead, consult your calendar and find out when your next scheduled dose is. \n \n\n- If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is only \n1 to 7 days away… \n \nNever take two Ibandronic Acid Teva tablets within the same week. You should wait until \nthe next scheduled dose is due and take it as normal; then, continue taking one tablet once a \nmonth on the scheduled days you’ve marked on your calendar. \n \n\n- If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is more \nthan 7 days away… \nYou should take one tablet the next morning after the day you remember; then, continue taking \none tablet once a month on the scheduled days you’ve marked on your calendar. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n \n4.
