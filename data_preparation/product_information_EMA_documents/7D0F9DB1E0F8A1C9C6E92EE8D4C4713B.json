NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nAZOPT 10 mg/ml eye drops, suspension \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml of suspension contains 10 mg brinzolamide. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\n \n\nEach ml of suspension contains 0.1 mg benzalkonium chloride. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nEye drops, suspension. \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAZOPT is indicated to decrease elevated intraocular pressure in: \n\n• ocular hypertension \n\n• open-angle glaucoma \n\nas monotherapy in adult patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or in adult patients in whom beta-\n\nblockers are contraindicated, or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues (see \n\nalso section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nWhen used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, the dose is one drop of AZOPT in the conjunctival \n\nsac of the affected eye(s) twice daily. Some patients may have a better response with one drop \n\nthree times a day. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population \n\nNo dose adjustment in elderly patients is necessary. \n\n \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nAZOPT has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and is therefore not recommended in \n\nsuch patients. \n\n \n\nAZOPT has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n< 30 ml/min) or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis. Since brinzolamide and its main metabolite \n\nare excreted predominantly by the kidney, AZOPT is therefore contra-indicated in such patients (see \n\nalso section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of AZOPT in infants, children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years have not \n\nbeen established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1. AZOPT is not \n\nrecommended for use in infants, children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nNasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation is recommended. This may reduce \n\nthe systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a \n\ndecrease in systemic side effects. \n\n \n\nInstruct the patient to shake the bottle well before use. After the cap is removed, if tamper evident snap \n\ncollar is loose, remove before using the product. \n\n \n\nTo prevent contamination of the dropper tip and suspension, care must be taken not to touch the \n\neyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. Instruct patients to keep \n\nthe bottle tightly closed when not in use. \n\n \n\nWhen substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma agent with AZOPT, discontinue the other agent \n\nand start the following day with AZOPT. \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicines must be \n\nadministered at least 5 minutes apart. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. The dose should not \n\nexceed one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n Known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides (see also section 4.4). \n\n Severe renal impairment. \n\n Hyperchloraemic acidosis. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSystemic effects \n\n \n\nAZOPT is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase and, although administered topically, is \n\nabsorbed systemically. The same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulphonamides may \n\noccur with topical administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue \n\nthe use of this preparation. \n\n \n\nAcid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Use with caution \n\nin patients with risk of renal impairment because the possible risk of metabolic acidosis (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide has not been studied in pre-term infants (less than 36 weeks gestational age) or those \n\nless than 1 week of age. Patients with significant renal tubular immaturity or abnormalities should only \n\nreceive brinzolamide after careful consideration of the risk benefit balance because of the possible risk \n\nof metabolic acidosis. \n\n \n\nOral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness \n\nand/or physical coordination. AZOPT is absorbed systemically and therefore this may occur with \n\ntopical administration. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nConcomitant therapy \n\n \n\nThere is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and AZOPT. The concomitant \n\nadministration of AZOPT and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not \n\nrecommended (see also section 4.5). \n\n \n\nAZOPT was primarily evaluated in concomitant administration with timolol during adjunctive \n\nglaucoma therapy. Additionally the IOP-reducing effect of AZOPT as adjunctive therapy to the \n\nprostaglandin analogue travoprost has been studied. No long term data are available on the use of \n\nAZOPT as adjunctive therapy to travoprost(see also section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with AZOPT in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma \n\nor pigmentary glaucoma. Caution should be used in treating these patients and close monitoring of \n\nintraocular pressure (IOP) is recommended. AZOPT has not been studied in patients with narrow-\n\nangle glaucoma and its use is not recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nThe possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients \n\nwith compromised corneas (particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count). Specifically, \n\npatients wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when \n\nusing brinzolamide is recommended, since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration \n\nand wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea. Careful monitoring of patients with \n\ncompromised corneas such as patients with diabetes mellitus or corneal dystrophies is recommended. \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been \n\nreported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since AZOPT contains \n\nbenzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye \n\npatients, or in conditions where the cornea is compromised. \n\n \n\nAZOPT has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses. AZOPT contains benzalkonium \n\nchloride which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. Contact with \n\nsoft contact lenses is to be avoided. Patients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to the \n\napplication of AZOPT and wait at least 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion. \n\n \n\nPotential rebound effects following cessation of treatment with AZOPT have not been studied; the \n\nIOP-lowering effect is expected to last for 5-7 days. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of AZOPT in infants, children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years have not \n\nbeen established and its use is not recommended in infants, children or adolescents \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nSpecific interaction studies with other medicinal products have not been performed with AZOPT. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, AZOPT was used concomitantly with prostaglandin analogues and timolol \n\nophthalmic preparations without evidence of adverse interactions. Association between AZOPT and \n\nmiotics or adrenergic agonists has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy. \n\n \n\nAZOPT is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, is absorbed \n\nsystemically. Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The \n\npotential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving AZOPT. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include CYP3A4 (main), \n\nCYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. It is expected that inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide \n\nby CYP3A4. Caution is advised if CYP3A4 inhibitors are given concomitantly. However, \n\naccumulation of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route. Brinzolamide is not \n\nan inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isozymes. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ophthalmic brinzolamide in pregnant women. \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see also \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\nAZOPT is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether brinzolamide/metabolites are excreted in human milk following topical ocular \n\nadministration. Animal studies have shown the excretion of minimal levels of brinzolamide in breast \n\nmilk following oral administration. \n\n \n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from AZOPT therapy taking in to account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies with brinzolamide demonstrated no effect on fertility. Studies have not been performed \n\nto evaluate the effect of topical ocular administration of brinzolamide on human fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nAZOPT has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nTemporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines \n\n(see also section 4.8). If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision \n\nclears before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nOral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness \n\nand/or physical coordination (see also section 4.4 and section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies involving 2732 patients treated with AZOPT as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy \n\nto timolol maleate 5 mg/ml, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse reactions were: \n\ndysgeusia (6.0%) (bitter or unusual taste, see description below) and temporary blurred vision (5.4%) \n\nupon instillation, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes (see also section 4.7). \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with brinzolamide 10mg/ml eye drops, suspension \n\nand are classified according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n\n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \n\nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The adverse reactions were obtained from \n\nclinical trials and post-marketing spontaneous reports. \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Classification MedDRA Preferred Term (v.15.1) \n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon: nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis \n\nNot Known: rhinitis \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: red blood cell count decreased, blood chloride \n\nincreased \n\nImmune system disorders Not Known: hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Not known: decreased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: apathy, depression, depressed mood, libido \n\ndecreased, nightmare, nervousness \n\nRare: insomnia \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon: motor dysfunction, amnesia, dizziness, \n\nparaesthesia, headache \n\nRare: memory impairment, somnolence \n\nNot Known: tremor, hypoaesthesia, ageusia \n\nEye disorders Common: blurred vision, eye irritation, eye pain, foreign body \n\nsensation in eyes, ocular hyperaemia \n\nUncommon: corneal erosion, keratitis, punctate keratitis, \n\nkeratopathy, deposit eye, corneal staining, corneal epithelium \n\ndefect, corneal epithelium disorder, blepharitis, eye pruritus, \n\nconjunctivitis, eye swelling, meibomianitis, glare, \n\nphotophobiadry eye, allergic conjunctivitis, pterygium, scleral \n\npigmentation, asthenopia, ocular discomfort, abnormal \n\nsensation in eye, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, subconjunctival \n\ncyst, conjunctival hyperaemia, eyelids pruritus, eye discharge, \n\neyelid margin crusting, lacrimation increased \n\nRare: corneal oedema, diplopia, visual acuity reduced, \n\nphotopsia, hypoaesthesia eye, periorbital oedema, intraocular \n\npressure increased, optic nerve cup/disc ratio increased \n\nNot Known: corneal disorder, visual disturbance, eye allergy, \n\nmadarosis, eyelid disorder, erythema of eyelid \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Rare: tinnitus \n\nNot Known: vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon: cardio-respiratory distress, bradycardia, \n\npalpitations \n\nRare: angina pectoris, heart rate irregular \n\nNot Known: arrhythmia, tachycardia, hypertension, blood \n\npressure increased, blood pressure decreased, heart rate \n\nincreased \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: dyspnoea, epistaxis, oropharyngeal pain, \n\npharyngolaryngeal pain, throat irritation, upper airway cough \n\nsyndrome, rhinorrhoea, sneezing \n\nRare: bronchial hyperreactivity, upper respiratory tract \n\ncongestion, sinus congestion, nasal congestion, cough, nasal \n\ndryness \n\nNot Known: asthma \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common: dysgeusia \n\nUncommon: oesophagitis, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, \n\nstomach discomfort, flatulence, frequent bowel movements, \n\ngastrointestinal disorder, hypoaesthesia oral, paraesthesia oral, \n\ndry mouth \n\nHepato-biliary disorders Not Known: liver function test abnormal \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: rash, rash maculo-papular, skin tightness \n\nRare: urticaria, alopecia, pruritus generalised \n\nNot Known: dermatitis, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon: back pain, muscle spasms, myalgia \n\nNot Known: arthralgia, pain in extremity \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon: renal pain \n\nNot Known: pollakiuria \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: erectile dysfunction \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nUncommon: pain, chest discomfort, fatigue, feeling abnormal \n\nRare: chest pain, feeling jittery, asthenia, irritability \n\nNot Known: peripheral oedema, malaise \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \n\ncomplications \n\nUncommon: foreign body in eye \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse events \n\n \n\nDysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation) was the most frequently reported \n\nsystemic adverse reaction associated with the use of AZOPT during clinical studies. It is likely caused \n\nby passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal. Nasolacrimal occlusion or \n\ngently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce the incidence of this effect (see also \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nAZOPT is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with systemic absorption. Gastrointestinal, \n\nnervous system, haematological, renal and metabolic effects are generally associated with systemic \n\ncarbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The same type of adverse reactions that are attributable to oral carbonic \n\nanhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration. \n\n \n\nNo unexpected adverse reactions have been observed with AZOPT when used as adjunctive therapy to \n\ntravoprost. The adverse reactions seen with the adjunctive therapy have been observed with each \n\nactive substance alone. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn small short-term clinical trials, approximately 12.5% of paediatric patients were observed to \n\nexperience adverse reactions, the majority of which were local, non-serious ocular reactions such as \n\nconjunctival hyperaemia, eye irritation, eye discharge, and lacrimation increased (see also section 5.1). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n\n \n\nTreatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic \n\nstate, and possible nervous system effects may occur. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) \n\nand blood pH levels must be monitored. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, \n\nATC code: S01EC04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCarbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the eye. Carbonic \n\nanhydrase catalyses the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the \n\ndehydration of carbonic acid. \n\n \n\nInhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humour \n\nsecretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in \n\nsodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) which is a major risk \n\nfactor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. Brinzolamide, an \n\ninhibitor of carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), the predominant iso-enzyme in the eye, with an in vitro \n\nIC50 of 3.2 nM and a Ki of 0.13 nM against CA-II. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe IOP-reducing effect of AZOPT as adjunctive therapy to the prostaglandin analogue travoprost \n\nwas studied. Following a 4 week run-in with travoprost, patients with an IOP ≥19 mmHg were \n\nrandomized to receive added treatment with brinzolamide or timolol. An additional decrease in mean \n\ndiurnal IOP of 3.2 to 3.4 mmHg for the brinzolamide group and 3.2 to 4.2 mmHg for the timolol group \n\nwere observed. There was an overall higher incidence of non-serious ocular adverse reactions, mainly \n\nrelated to signs of local irritation, in the brinzolamide/travoprost groups. The events were mild and did \n\nnot affect the overall discontinuation rates in the studies (see also section 4.8). \n\n \n\nA clinical trial was conducted with AZOPT in 32 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age, \n\ndiagnosed with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Some patients were naive to IOP therapy whilst \n\nothers were on other IOP-lowering medicinal product(s). Those who had been on previous IOP \n\nmedicinal product(s) were not required to discontinue their IOP medicinal product(s) until initiation of \n\nmonotherapy with AZOPT. \n\n \n\nAmong patients who were naive to IOP therapy (10 patients), the efficacy of AZOPT was similar to \n\nthat seen previously in adults, with mean IOP reductions from baseline ranging up to 5 mmHg. Among \n\npatients who were on topical IOP-lowering medicinal product(s) (22 patients), mean IOP increased \n\nslightly from baseline in the AZOPT group. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFollowing topical ocular administration, brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Due to \n\nits high affinity for CA-II, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the red blood cells (RBCs) and \n\nexhibits a long half-life in whole blood (mean of approximately 24 weeks). In humans, the metabolite \n\nN-desethylbrinzolamide is formed, which also binds to CA and accumulates in RBCs. This metabolite \n\nbinds mainly to CA-I in the presence of brinzolamide. In plasma, both brinzolamide and N-\n\ndesethylbrinzolamide concentrations are low and generally below assay quantitation limits \n\n(<7.5 ng/ml). \n\n \n\nBinding to plasma proteins is not extensive (about 60%). Brinzolamide is eliminated primarily by \n\nrenal excretion (approximately 60%). About 20% of the dose has been accounted for in urine as \n\nmetabolite. Brinzolamide and N-desethylbrinzolamide are the predominant components in the urine \n\nalong with trace levels (<1%) of the N-desmethoxypropyl and O-desmethyl metabolites. \n\n \n\nIn an oral pharmacokinetic study, healthy volunteers received 1 mg capsules of brinzolamide twice \n\ndaily for up to 32 weeks and RBC CA activity was measured to assess the degree of systemic CA \n\ninhibition. \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide saturation of RBC CA-II was achieved within 4 weeks (RBC concentrations of \n\napproximately 20 µM). N-Desethylbrinzolamide accumulated in RBCs to steady state within 20-\n\n28 weeks reaching concentrations ranging from 6-30 µM. The inhibition of total RBC CA activity at \n\nsteady state was approximately 70-75%. \n\n \n\nSubjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/minute) were administered \n\n1 mg of brinzolamide twice daily orally for up to 54 weeks. Brinzolamide RBC concentration ranged \n\nfrom about 20 to 40 µM by week 4 of treatment. At steady-state, brinzolamide and its metabolite RBC \n\nconcentrations ranged from 22.0 to 46.1 and 17.1 to 88.6 µM, respectively. \n\n \n\nN-desethylbrinzolamide RBC concentrations increased and total RBC CA activity decreased with \n\ndecreasing creatinine clearance but brinzolamide RBC concentrations and CA-II activity remained \n\nunchanged. In subjects with the highest degree of renal impairment inhibition of total CA activity was \n\ngreater although it was inferior to 90% at steady-state. \n\n \n\nIn a topical ocular study, at steady-state, brinzolamide RBC concentrations were similar to those found \n\nin the oral study, but levels of N-desethylbrinzolamide were lower. Carbonic anhydrase activity was \n\napproximately 40-70% of predose levels. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg/kg/day \n\n(125 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed no effect on foetal development \n\ndespite significant maternal toxicity. Similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced ossification of \n\nskull and sternebrae of foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses of 18 mg/kg/day (375 times \n\nthe recommended human ophthalmic dose), but not 6 mg/kg/day. These findings occurred at doses that \n\ncaused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal weights. \n\nDose-related decreases in foetal weights were observed in pups of dams receiving brinzolamide orally \n\nranging from a slight decrease (about 5-6%) at 2 mg/kg/day to nearly 14% at 18 mg/kg/day. During \n\nlactation, the no adverse effect level in the offspring was 5 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What AZOPT is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use AZOPT \n\n3. How to use AZOPT \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store AZOPT \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What AZOPT is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nAZOPT contains brinzolamide which belongs to a group of medicines called carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibitors. It reduces pressure within the eye. \n\n \n\nAZOPT eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye. This pressure can lead to an illness called \n\nglaucoma. \n\n \n\nIf the pressure in the eye is too high, it can damage your sight. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use AZOPT \n\n \n\nDo not use AZOPT \n\n- if you have severe kidney problems. \n\n- if you are allergic to brinzolamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you are allergic to medicines called sulphonamides. Examples include medicines used to treat \n\ndiabetes and infections and also diuretics (water tablets). AZOPT may cause the same allergy. \n\n- if you have too much acidity in your blood (a condition called hyperchloraemic acidosis). \n\n \n\nIf you have further questions, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AZOPT: \n\n- if you have kidney or liver problems. \n\n- if you have dry eyes or cornea problems. \n\n- if you are taking other sulphonamide medicines \n\n- if you have a specific form of glaucoma in which the pressure inside the eye rises due to \n\ndeposits that block fluid draining out (pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma) or \n\na specific form of glaucoma in which the pressure inside the eye (sometimes rapidly) rises \n\nbecause the eye bulges forward and blocks fluid draining out (narrow-angle glaucoma) \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAZOPT is not to be used by infants, children or adolescents under 18 years of age unless advised by \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and AZOPT \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dorzolamide, see \n\nsection 1 What AZOPT is and what it is used for), talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nWomen who may become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during AZOPT \n\ntreatment. The use of AZOPT is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Do not use \n\nAZOPT unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not drive or use machines until your vision is clear. You may find that your vision is blurred for a \n\ntime just after using AZOPT. \n\n \n\nAZOPT may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical \n\ncoordination. If affected, take care when driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nAZOPT contains benzalkonium chloride \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 3.35 µg benzalkonium chloride per drop (= 1 dose) which is equivalent to \n\n0.01% or 0.1 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nAZOPT contains a preservative (benzalkonium chloride) which may be absorbed by soft contact \n\nlenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before \n\nusing this medicine and put them back 15 minutes afterwards. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause \n\neye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of \n\nthe eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk \n\nto your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use AZOPT \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nOnly use AZOPT for your eyes. Do not swallow or inject. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is \n\n1 drop in the affected eye or eyes twice a day - morning and night. \n\nUse this much unless your doctor told you to do something different. Only use AZOPT in both eyes if \n\nyour doctor told you to. Take it for as long as your doctor told you to. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nHow to use \n\n   \n 1 2 3 \n\n \n\n Get the AZOPT bottle and a mirror \n\n Wash your hands \n\n Shake the bottle and twist off the cap. After the cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar \nis loose, remove before using product. \n\n Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and middle finger \n\n Tilt your head back. Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between \nthe eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 1) \n\n Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use the mirror if it helps \n\n Do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could \ninfect the drops \n\n Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of AZOPT at a time. \n\n Do not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs \n(picture 2) \n\n After using AZOPT, press a finger to the corner of your eye, by the nose (picture 3) for at least \n1 minute. This helps to stop AZOPT getting into the rest of the body. \n\n If you take drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. \n\n Put the bottle cap back on firmly immediately after use \n\n Use up one bottle before opening the next bottle. \n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drops, leave at least 5 minutes between putting in AZOPT and the other \n\ndrops. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\nIf you use more AZOPT than you should \n\nIf you get too much in your eyes, rinse it all out with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until \n\nit’s time for your next regular dose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use AZOPT \nUse a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular routine. Do not use a \n\ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using AZOPT \n\nIf you stop using AZOPT without speaking to your doctor, the pressure in your eye will not be \n\ncontrolled which could lead to loss of sight. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
