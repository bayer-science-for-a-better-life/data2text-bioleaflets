NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPradaxa 75 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains 75 mg of dabigatran etexilate (as mesilate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nCapsules with white, opaque cap and white, opaque body of size 2 (approx. 18 x 6 mm) filled with \nyellowish pellets. The cap is imprinted with the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol, the body with \n“R75”.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPrimary prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone \nelective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery.\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less than \n18 years of age.\n\nFor age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPradaxa capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or older who are able to \nswallow the capsules whole. Pradaxa coated granules can be used in children aged less than 12 years\nas soon as the child is able to swallow soft food. Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution should \nonly be used in children aged less than 1 year.\n\nWhen changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated \nin the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed for the age and weight of the child.\n\nPrimary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery\n\nThe recommended doses of dabigatran etexilate and the duration of therapy for primary prevention of \nVTE in orthopaedic surgery are shown in table 1.\n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1: Dose recommendations and duration of therapy for primary prevention of VTE in \northopaedic surgery\n\nTreatment initiation \non the day of surgery \n1-4 hours after \ncompleted surgery\n\nMaintenance \ndose starting \non the first day \nafter surgery\n\nDuration of \nmaintenance dose\n\nPatients following elective knee \nreplacement surgery\n\nsingle capsule of \n110 mg dabigatran \netexilate\n\n220 mg \ndabigatran \netexilate once \ndaily taken as \n2 capsules of \n110 mg\n\n10 days\n\nPatients following elective hip \nreplacement surgery 28-35 days\n\nDose reduction recommended\n\nPatients with moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \n(CrCL 30-50 mL/min) single capsule of \n\n75 mg dabigatran \netexilate\n\n150 mg \ndabigatran \netexilate once \ndaily taken as \n2 capsules of \n75 mg\n\n10 days (knee \nreplacement \nsurgery) or 28-\n35 days (hip \nreplacement \nsurgery)\n\nPatients who receive concomitant \nverapamil*, amiodarone, quinidine \n\nPatients aged 75 or above \n\n*For patients with moderate renal impairment concomitantly treated with verapamil see Special \npopulations\n\nFor both surgeries, if haemostasis is not secured, initiation of treatment should be delayed. If treatment \nis not started on the day of surgery then treatment should be initiated with 2 capsules once daily.\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment\n\nIn all patients and especially in the elderly (>75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this \nage group:\n? Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to \n\ninitiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment \n(i.e. CrCL <30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n? Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during \ntreatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal \nproducts ).\n\nThe method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method. \n\nMissed dose\n\nIt is recommended to continue with the remaining daily doses of dabigatran etexilate at the same time \nof the next day.\n\nNo double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be \ninstructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as \ndyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n4\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 24 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min), a dose reduction is recommended\n(see table 1 above and sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nConcomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. \namiodarone, quinidine or verapamil\n\nDosing should be reduced as indicated in table 1 (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation \ndabigatran etexilate and these medicinal products should be taken at the same time.\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with verapamil, a dose \nreduction of dabigatran etexilate to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nElderly\n\nFor elderly patients >75 years, a dose reduction is recommended (see table 1 above and sections 4.4 \nand 5.1).\n\nWeight\n\nThere is very limited clinical experience in patients with a body weight <50 kg or >110 kg at the \nrecommended posology. Given the available clinical and kinetic data no adjustment is necessary (see \nsection 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nGender\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of\nprimary prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or \ntotal knee replacement surgery.\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients\n\nFor the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with \na parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be \ninitiated following previous treatment.\n\n\n\n5\n\nDabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the \nevening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 12 hours \nas possible.\n\nThe recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules is based on the patient’s age and weight as \nshown in table 2. The table provides the single doses which are to be administered twice daily. The \ndose should be adjusted according to age and weight as treatment progresses.\n\nTable 2: Single dabigatran etexilate dose in milligrams (mg) by weight in kilograms (kg) and \nage in years of the patient to be administered twice daily\n\nAge in years\n8 to <9 9 to \n\n<10\n10 to \n<11\n\n11 to \n<12\n\n12 to \n<13\n\n13 to \n<14\n\n14 to \n<15\n\n15 to \n<16\n\n16 to \n<17\n\n17 to \n<18\n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nt \n\n[k\ng]\n\n>81 300 mg\nas two 150 mg capsules\n\nor\nfour 75 mg capsules\n\n71 to <81\n\n61 to <71\n\n51 to <61\n\n260 mg\nas one 110 mg plus one 150 mg capsule\n\nor\none 110 mg plus two 75 mg capsules\n\n41 to <51\n220 mg\n\nas two 110 mg capsules\n\n31 to <41\n185 mg\n\nas one 75 mg plus one 110 mg capsule\n\n26 to <31\n150 mg\n\nas one 150 mg capsule\nor\n\ntwo 75 mg capsules21 to <26\n\n16 to <21\nOne 110 mg capsule\n\n13 to <16\n\n11 to <13\nOne \n75 mg\ncapsule\n\nMeans that no dosing recommendation can be provided.\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during treatment\n\nPrior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated \nusing the Schwartz formula.\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with an eGFR ?50 mL/min/1.73m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 2.\n\nWhile on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected \nthat the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain \nco-medications, etc).\n\nDuration of use\n\nThe duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment.\n\n\n\n6\n\nMissed dose\n\nA forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. \nFrom 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. \nA double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients or their \ncaregivers should be instructed to contact the treating physician if the patient develops gastrointestinal \nsymptoms such as dyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of\ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nPatients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate.\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis medicinal product is for oral use.\nThe capsules can be taken with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed as a whole with a \nglass of water, to facilitate delivery to the stomach.\nPatients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see \nsections 5.2 and 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n? Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n? Severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) in adult patients\n? eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 in paediatric patients\n? Active clinically significant bleeding\n? Lesion or condition, if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include\n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities\n\n? Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), \noral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under specific circumstances. \nThese are switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is given at doses \n\n\n\n7\n\nnecessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during \ncatheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.5)\n\n? Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival\n? Concomitant treatment with the following strong P-gp inhibitors: systemic ketoconazole, \n\ncyclosporine, itraconazole, dronedarone and the fixed-dose combination \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir (see section 4.5)\n\n? Prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment (see section 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaemorrhagic risk\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or\nwith concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet \naggregation. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or \nhaematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.\n\nFor adult patients in situations of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the \nanticoagulation effect of dabigatran is required, the specific reversal agent idarucizumab is available. \nThe efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. \nHaemodialysis can remove dabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, \ncoagulation factor concentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet \nconcentrates are other possible options (see also section 4.9).\n\nUse of platelet aggregation inhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non \nsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or \ngastroesophageal reflux increase the risk of GI bleeding.\n\nRisk factors\n\nTable 3 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nTable 3: Factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nRisk factor\nPharmacodynamic and kinetic factors Age ?75 years\nFactors increasing dabigatran plasma levels Major:\n\n? Moderate renal impairment in adult \npatients (30-50 mL/min CrCL)\n\n? Strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.3 and \n4.5)\n\n? Mild to moderate P-gp inhibitor \nco-medication (e.g. amiodarone, verapamil, \nquinidine and ticagrelor; see section 4.5)\n\nMinor:\n? Low body weight (<50 kg) in adult patients\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions (see section 4.5) ? ASA and other platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel\n\n? NSAIDs\n? SSRIs or SNRIs\n? Other medicinal products which may \n\nimpair haemostasis\nDiseases / procedures with special \nhaemorrhagic risks\n\n? Congenital or acquired coagulation \ndisorders\n\n? Thrombocytopenia or functional platelet \n\n\n\n8\n\ndefects\n? Recent biopsy, major trauma\n? Bacterial endocarditis\n? Esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal \n\nreflux\n\nLimited data is available in adult patients <50 kg (see section 5.2). \n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric \npatients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5).\n\nPrecautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk\n\nFor the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9.\n\nBenefit-risk assessment \n\nThe presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, \nantiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major\nbleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the \nbenefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nLimited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with \nactive meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran \netexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nClose clinical surveillance\n\nClose observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, \nespecially if risk factors are combined (see table 3 above). Particular caution should be exercised when \ndabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp \ninhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.5).\nClose observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nNSAIDs (see section 4.5).\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nPatients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate (see also section 4.3).\n\nWhen severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated and \nuse of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) may be considered in adult patients. The efficacy and \nsafety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove \ndabigatran.\n\nUse of proton-pump inhibitors\n\nThe administration of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. In case \nof paediatric patients local labeling recommendations for proton pump inhibitors have to be followed.\n\n\n\n9\n\nLaboratory coagulation parameters\n\nAlthough this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the \nmeasurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to \ndabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors. \nDiluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test \nvariability (see section 5.1).\nThe international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false \npositive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed.\n\nTable 4 shows coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an \nincreased risk of bleeding. Respective thresholds for paediatric patients are not known (see section \n5.1).\n\nTable 4: Coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with \nan increased risk of bleeding.\n\nTest (trough value) Threshold\ndTT [ng/mL] >67\nECT [x-fold upper limit of normal] No data\naPTT [x-fold upper limit of normal] >1.3\nINR Should not be performed\n\nUse of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke\n\nThe use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be \nconsidered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal \n(ULN) according to the local reference range.\n\nSurgery and interventions\n\nPatients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for \nbleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran \netexilate.\n\nCaution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and \nanticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency \nmay take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such \ncases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still \nimpaired.\n\nEmergency surgery or urgent procedures\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. When rapid reversal of the anticoagulation \neffect is required the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran is available for adult \npatients. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. \nHaemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nReversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. \nDabigatran etexilate treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if the \npatient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved. \n\n\n\n10\n\nSubacute surgery/interventions\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery / intervention should be delayed if \npossible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding \nmay be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention.\n\nElective surgery\n\nIf possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical \nprocedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may \nbe required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery. \n\nTable 5 summarises discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients.\n\nTable 5: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients\n\nRenal function\n(CrCL in \nmL/min)\n\nEstimated half-life \n(hours)\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be stopped before elective \nsurgery\n\nHigh risk of bleeding or \nmajor surgery\n\nStandard risk\n\n?80 ~ 13 2 days before 24 hours before\n?50-<80 ~ 15 2-3 days before 1-2 days before\n?30-<50 ~ 18 4 days before 2-3 days before (>48 hours)\n\nDiscontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients are summarised in \ntable 6.\n\nTable 6: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients\n\nRenal function\n(eGFR in mL/min/1.73m2)\n\nStop dabigatran before elective surgery\n\n>80 24 hours before\n50 – 80 2 days before\n<50 These patients have not been studied (see section 4.3).\n\nSpinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture\n\nProcedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function.\n\nThe risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture \nand by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least \n2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients \nrequire frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma.\n\nPostoperative phase\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as \npossible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established. \n\nPatients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with reduced renal \nfunction (see also table 3), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nPatients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events\n\nThere are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and \ntherefore they should be treated with caution.\n\n\n\n11\n\nHip fracture surgery\n\nThere is no data on the use of dabigatran etexilate in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. \nTherefore treatment is not recommended.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes >2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment \nexperience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate \nis not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any \nimpact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nInteraction with P-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma \nconcentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for \npatients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular \nfor patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 2-\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.\n\nActive cancer patients (paediatric VTE)\n\nThere is limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nFor some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption \nmay be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTransporter interactions\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp \ninhibitors (see table 7) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.\n\nIf not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or \nanaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. Dose reductions \nmay be required in combination with some P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nTable 7: Transporter interactions\n\nP-gp inhibitors\n\nConcomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3)\n\nKetoconazole Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values by 2.38-fold and \n2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold and \n2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once\ndaily. \n\n\n\n12\n\nDronedarone When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total\ndabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, \nrespectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone bid, and about 2.1-fold \nand 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg. \n\nItraconazole,\ncyclosporine\n\nBased on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. \n\nGlecaprevir /\npibrentasvir\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of the \nP-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase exposure of \ndabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nTacrolimus Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-\ngp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate has not been \nclinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited clinical data with \nanother P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the inhibition of P-gp with \ntacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong P-gp inhibitors. \n\nCautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4)\n\nVerapamil When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the \nCmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this change \ndiffers depending on timing of administration and formulation of verapamil (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nThe greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an \nimmediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to the \ndabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC by about \n2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration of an \nextended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and AUC by about \n1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increase of Cmax by \nabout 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold).\n\nThere was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours \nafter dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC by about \n1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 2 hours.\n\nAmiodarone When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg\namiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active \nmetabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were \nincreased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the long half-life \nof amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks after \ndiscontinuation of amiodarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nQuinidine Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1,000 mg. \nDabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day \neither with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on \naverage by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with concomitant quinidine (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nClarithromycin When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with \ndabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold and \nCmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. \n\nTicagrelor When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered \nsimultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC and \nCmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After multiple doses \nof ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. the increase of dabigatran exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-\nfold for Cmax and AUC, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg \n\n\n\n13\n\ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss by \n1.49-fold  and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\nwas reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran \netexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended administration for \nstart of ticagrelor with a loading dose.\n\nConcomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor b.i.d. (maintenance dose) with \n110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\n1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone.\n\nPosaconazole Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. \nCaution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with \nposaconazole.\n\nP-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant use should be avoided.\n\ne.g. rifampicin, \nSt. John´s wort \n(Hypericum \nperforatum), \ncarbamazepine, \nor phenytoin\n\nConcomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran \nconcentrations.\n\nPre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for \n7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5% and 67%, \nrespectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure \nclose to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No further \nincrease in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.\n\nProtease inhibitors such as ritonavir\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\ne.g. ritonavir \nand its \ncombinations \nwith other \nprotease \ninhibitors\n\nThese affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and \nare therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran etexilate.\n\nP-gp substrate\n\nDigoxin In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was \nco-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant \nchanges on dabigatran exposure have been observed.\n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nThere is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of \nbleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated \nheparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, \ndesirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral \nanticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa \nreceptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n14\n\nUFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3).\n\nTable 8: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with \nincreased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With \nchronic use in a phase III clinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke \nprevention in atrial fibrillation patients (RE-LY), NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding \nby approximately 50 % on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. \n\nClopidogrel In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran \netexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times \ncompared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss and \nthe coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation \nas measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined \ntreatment and the respective mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or \n600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40 % \n(see section 4.4) .\n\nASA Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the \nrisk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 24 % with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nLMWH The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not \nbeen specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily \n40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to \ndabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of dabigatran etexilate \n(single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity was observed after \ndabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that after \ntreatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over \neffect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran \nrelated anti-coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of \nenoxaparin.\n\nOther interactions\n\nTable 9: Other interactions\n\nSelective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake \ninhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nSSRIs, SNRIs SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in all treatment groups of a phase III \nclinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial \nfibrillation patients (RE-LY).\n\nSubstances influencing gastric pH\n\nPantoprazole When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran \nAUC of approximately 30% was observed. Pantoprazole and other proton-pump \ninhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and concomitant \nPPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa.\n\nRanitidine Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran.\n\n\n\n15\n\nInteractions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no \nin vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions \nare not expected with dabigatran.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women.\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown.\n\nPradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding.\nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data available.\n\nIn animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations \nand an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure \nlevel compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence \non male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5- to 10-fold higher plasma \nexposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an \nincrease in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre- and post-natal study, an \nincrease in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to \na plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64,000 patients; \nthereof approximately 35,000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate.\n\nIn actively controlled VTE prevention trials 6,684 patients were treated with 150 mg or 220 mg \ndabigatran etexilate daily.\n\n\n\n16\n\nThe most commonly reported events are bleedings occurring in approximately 14 % of patients; the \nfrequency of major bleeds (including wound site bleedings) is less than 2 %.\n\nAlthough rare in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of \nlocation, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 10 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Classes (SOC) and\nfrequency using the following convention: very common (?1/10), common (? 1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (?1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (?1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 10: Adverse reactions\n\nSOC / Preferred term Frequency\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nHaemoglobin decreased Common\nAnaemia Uncommon\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon\nThrombocytopenia Rare\nNeutropenia Not known\nAgranulocytosis Not known\n\nImmune system disorder\nDrug hypersensitivity Uncommon\nAnaphylactic reaction Rare\nAngioedema Rare\nUrticaria Rare\nRash Rare\nPruritus Rare\nBronchospasm Not known\n\nNervous system disorders\nIntracranial haemorrhage Rare\n\nVascular disorders\nHaematoma Uncommon\nWound haemorrhage Uncommon\nHaemorrhage Rare \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis Uncommon\nHaemoptysis Rare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon\nRectal haemorrhage Uncommon\nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Uncommon\nDiarrhoea Uncommon\nNausea Uncommon\nVomiting Uncommon\nGastrointestinal ulcer, including oesophageal \nulcer \n\nRare\n\nGastroesophagitis Rare\nGastroesophageal reflux disease Rare\nAbdominal pain Rare\nDyspepsia Rare\nDysphagia Rare\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\n\n\n\n17\n\nHepatic function abnormal/ Liver function Test \nabnormal\n\nCommon\n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nHepatic enzyme increased Uncommon\nHyperbilirubinaemia Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorder\nSkin haemorrhage Uncommon\nAlopecia Not known\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nHaemarthrosis Uncommon\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nGenitourological haemorrhage, including \nhaematuria\n\nUncommon\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site haemorrhage Rare\nCatheter site haemorrhage Rare\nBloody discharge Rare\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon\nPost procedural haematoma Uncommon\nPost procedural haemorrhage Uncommon\nPost procedural discharge Uncommon\nWound secretion Uncommon\nIncision site haemorrhage Rare\nAnaemia postoperative Rare\n\nSurgical and medical procedures\nWound drainage Rare\nPost procedural drainage Rare\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nBleeding reactions\n\nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of dabigatran etexilate may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ. The signs, symptoms, and severity \n(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding \nand/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were \nseen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. \nThus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of \nvalue to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. \nthose patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis\nor strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may \npresent as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and \nunexplained shock.\n\nKnown bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to \nhypoperfusion have been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. For adult patients, a specific \nreversal agent for dabigatran, idarucizumab, is available in case of uncontrollable bleeding (see \nSection 4.9).\n\nThe table 11 shows the number (%) of patients experiencing the adverse reaction bleeding during the \ntreatment period in the indication primary VTE prevention after hip or knee replacement surgery in the \ntwo pivotal clinical trials, according to dose.\n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 11: Number (%) of patients experiencing the adverse reaction bleeding\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg\nN (%)\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n220 mg\nN (%)\n\nEnoxaparin\n\nN (%)\nTreated 1,866(100.0) 1,825(100.0) 1,848(100.0)\nMajor bleeding 24 (1.3) 33 (1.8) 27 (1.5)\nAny bleeding 258(13.8) 251(13.8) 247(13.4)\n\nAgranulocytosis and neutropenia\n\nAgranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported very rarely during post approval use of \ndabigatran etexilate. Because adverse reactions are reported in the postmarketing surveillance setting \nfrom a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably determine their frequency. The \nreporting rate was estimated as 7 events per 1 million patient years for agranulocytosis and as 5 events \nper 1 million patient years for neutropenia.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients was studied in two phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1160.108). In total, 328\npaediatric patients had been treated with dabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and weight \nadjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate.\n\nOverall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults.\n\nIn total, 26% of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of \nrecurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 12 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and \nprevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ \nClass (SOC) and frequency using the following convention: very common (?1/10), common (?1/100 \nto <1/10), uncommon (?1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (?1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 12: Adverse reactions\n\nFrequency\n\nSOC / Preferred term. treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nAnaemia Common\nHaemoglobin decreased Uncommon\nThrombocytopenia Common\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon\nNeutropenia Uncommon\nAgranulocytosis Not known\n\nImmune system disorder\nDrug hypersensitivity Uncommon\nRash Common\nPruritus Uncommon\nAnaphylactic reaction Not known\nAngioedema Not known\n\n\n\n19\n\nUrticaria Common\nBronchospasm Not known\n\nNervous system disorders\nIntracranial haemorrhage Uncommon\n\nVascular disorders\nHaematoma Common\nHaemorrhage Not known\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis Common\nHaemoptysis Uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon\nAbdominal pain Uncommon\nDiarrhoea Common\nDyspepsia Common\nNausea Common \nRectal haemorrhage Uncommon\nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Not known\nGastrointestinal ulcer, including \noesophageal ulcer\n\nNot known\n\nGastroesophagitis Uncommon\nGastroesophageal reflux disease Common\nVomiting Common\nDysphagia Uncommon\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nHepatic function abnormal/ Liver \nfunction Test abnormal\n\nNot known\n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nHepatic enzyme increased Common\nHyperbilirubinaemia Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorder\nSkin haemorrhage Uncommon \nAlopecia Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nHaemarthrosis Not known\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nGenitourological haemorrhage, \nincluding haematuria\n\nUncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site haemorrhage Not known\nCatheter site haemorrhage Not known\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon\nIncision site haemorrhage Not known\n\nBleeding reactions\n\nIn the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1%) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5%) a \nclinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9%) a minor bleeding event. The \nfrequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to <18 years: 28.6%) than \nin the younger age groups (birth to <2 years: 23.3%; 2 to <12 years: 16.2%). Major or severe bleeding, \nregardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\n\n\n20\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of \nbleeding.\n\nIn case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the \ntime by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional \nmeasures e.g. dialysis have been initiated.\n\nExcessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran \nis excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding \nis low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this \napproach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).\n\nManagement of bleeding complications\n\nIn the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and \nthe source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive \ntreatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the \nprescriber’s discretion.\n\nFor adult patients in situations when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is required \nthe specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran is \navailable. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nCoagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken \ninto account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in \nreversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and \nalso on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become \nunreliable following administration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be \nexercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of \nplatelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal \nproducts have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's \njudgement.\n\nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. \nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible \ndirect thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma.\nSince thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the \ncoagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free \nthrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant \nactivity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral \nadministration in various animal models of thrombosis.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant \neffect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT.\n\nThe calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma \nconcentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the \ncalibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of \nquantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered.\n\nThe ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nThe aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation \nintensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable \nfor precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of \ndabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value \nindicates that the patient is anticoagulated.\n\nIn general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran \nlevels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile \nof dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough (for aPTT \nthresholds see section 4.4, table 4) is considered to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nPrimary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery\n\nSteady state (after day 3) geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around \n2 hours after 220 mg dabigatran etexilate administration, was 70.8 ng/mL, with a range of \n35.2-162 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, \nmeasured at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 24 hours after a 220 mg dabigatran dose), was on \naverage 22.0 ng/mL, with a range of 13.0-35.7 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range).\n\nIn a dedicated study exclusively in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance, \nCrCL 30-50 mL/min) treated with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg QD, the dabigatran geometric mean \ntrough concentration, measured at the end of the dosing interval, was on average 47.5 ng/mL, with a \nrange of 29.6 - 72.2 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range).\n\nIn patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery with 220 mg \ndabigatran etexilate once daily,\n? the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations was 67 ng/mL, measured at trough \n\n(20-28 hours after the previous dose) (see section 4.4 and 4.9),\n? the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (20-28 hours after the previous dose) was 51 seconds, \n\nwhich would be 1.3-fold upper limit of normal.\n\n\n\n22\n\nThe ECT was not measured in patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement \nsurgery with 220 mg dabigatran etexilate once daily.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nEthnic origin\n\nNo clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or \nChinese patients were observed.\n\nClinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery\n\nIn 2 large randomised, parallel group, double-blind, dose-confirmatory trials, patients undergoing \nelective major orthopaedic surgery (one for knee replacement surgery and one for hip replacement \nsurgery) received 75 mg or 110 mg dabigatran etexilate within 1-4 hours of surgery followed by \n150 mg or 220 mg once daily thereafter, haemostasis having been secured, or enoxaparin 40 mg on the \nday prior to surgery and daily thereafter. \nIn the RE-MODEL trial (knee replacement) treatment was for 6-10 days and in the RE-NOVATE trial \n(hip replacement) for 28-35 days. Totals of 2,076 patients (knee) and 3,494 (hip) were treated \nrespectively.\n\nComposite of total VTE (including pulmonary embolism (PE), proximal and distal deep vein \nthrombosis (DVT), whatever symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and \nall-cause mortality constituted the primary end-point for both studies. Composite of major VTE \n(including PE and proximal DVT, whatever symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine \nvenography) and VTE-related mortality constituted a secondary end-point and is considered of better \nclinical relevance.\nResults of both studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of 220 mg and 150 mg dabigatran \netexilate were statistically non-inferior to that of enoxaparin on total VTE and all-cause mortality. The \npoint estimate for incidence of major VTE and VTE related mortality for the 150 mg dose was slightly \nworse than enoxaparin (table 13). Better results were seen with the 220 mg dose where the point \nestimate of Major VTE was slightly better than enoxaparin (table 13).\n\nThe clinical studies have been conducted in a patient population with a mean age >65 years.\n\nThere were no differences in the phase 3 clinical studies for efficacy and safety data between men and \nwomen.\n\nIn the studied patient population of RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE (5,539 patients treated), 51 % \nsuffered from concomitant hypertension, 9 % from concomitant diabetes, 9 % from concomitant\ncoronary artery disease and 20 % had a history of venous insufficiency. None of these diseases \nshowed an impact on the effects of dabigatran on VTE-prevention or bleeding rates.\n\nData for the major VTE and VTE-related mortality endpoint were homogeneous with regards to the \nprimary efficacy endpoint and are shown in table 13.\n\nData for the total VTE and all cause mortality endpoint are shown in table 14.\n\nData for adjudicated major bleeding endpoints are shown in table 15 below.\n\n\n\n23\n\nTable 13: Analysis of major VTE and VTE-related mortality during the treatment period in the \nRE-MODEL and the RE-NOVATE orthopaedic surgery studies\n\nTrial Dabigatran etexilate\n220 mg\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg\n\nEnoxaparin\n40 mg\n\nRE-NOVATE (hip)\nN 909 888 917\nIncidences (%) 28 (3.1) 38 (4.3) 36 (3.9)\nRisk ratio over \nenoxaparin\n\n0.78 1.09\n\n95 % CI 0.48, 1.27 0.70, 1.70\nRE-MODEL (knee)\nN 506 527 511\nIncidences (%) 13 (2.6) 20 (3.8) 18 (3.5)\nRisk ratio over \nenoxaparin\n\n0.73 1.08\n\n95 % CI 0.36, 1.47 0.58, 2.01\n\nTable 14: Analysis of total VTE and all cause mortality during the treatment period in the \nRE-NOVATE and the RE-MODEL orthopaedic surgery studies\n\nTrial Dabigatran etexilate\n220 mg\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg\n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg\n\nRE-NOVATE (hip)\nN 880 874 897\nIncidences (%) 53 (6.0) 75 (8.6) 60 (6.7)\nRisk ratio over \nenoxaparin\n\n0.9 1.28\n\n95 % CI (0.63, 1.29) (0.93, 1.78)\nRE-MODEL (knee)\nN 503 526 512\nIncidences (%) 183 (36.4) 213 (40.5) 193 (37.7)\nRisk ratio over \nenoxaparin\n\n0.97 1.07\n\n95 % CI (0.82, 1.13) (0.92, 1.25)\n\nTable 15: Major bleeding events by treatment in the individual RE-MODEL and the \nRE-NOVATE studies\n\nTrial Dabigatran etexilate\n220 mg\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg\n\nEnoxaparin\n40 mg\n\nRE-NOVATE (hip)\nTreated patients N 1,146 1,163 1,154\nNumber of MBE \nN(%)\n\n23 (2.0) 15 (1.3) 18 (1.6)\n\nRE-MODEL (knee)\nTreated patients N 679 703 694\nNumber of MBE \nN(%)\n\n10 (1.5) 9 (1.3) 9 (1.3)\n\nClinical trials for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves\n\nA phase II study examined dabigatran etexilate and warfarin in a total of 252 patients with recent \nmechanical valve replacement surgery (i.e. within the current hospital stay) and in patients who \nreceived a mechanical heart valve replacement more than three months ago. More thromboembolic \nevents (mainly strokes and symptomatic/asymptomatic prosthetic valve thrombosis) and more \n\n\n\n24\n\nbleeding events were observed with dabigatran etexilate than with warfarin. In the early post-operative \npatients, major bleeding manifested predominantly as haemorrhagic pericardial effusions, specifically \nin patients who started dabigatran etexilate early (i.e. on Day 3) after heart valve replacement surgery \n(see section 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPradaxa in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of thromboembolic events for the \nindication of primary prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone elective total hip \nreplacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse).\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients\n\nThe DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate \ncompared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, non-\ninferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-\nappropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses \nadjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or \nvitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a \ncomposite endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and \nfreedom from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and \nintracranial abscess.\nIn total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran \netexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were \n12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than \n2 years.\nOf the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients \n(42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus \nresolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The \ncorresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent \nresults were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the \ntreatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the \n3 different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the \ndabigatran etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1%) and 7/13 (53.8%) for patients \nfrom birth to <2 years, 21/43 (48.8%) and 12/21 (57.1%) for patients aged 2 to <12 years, and 47/112 \n(42.0%) and 19/56 (33.9%) for patients aged 12 to <18 years.\nAdjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and \n2 patients (2.2%) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first \nmajor bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6%) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients \n(24.4%) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The \ncombined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major \n(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4%) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group \nand 3 (3.3%) patients in the SOC group.\n\nAn open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was \nconducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the \npresence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least \n3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. \nEligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, \ncoated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a \nmaximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major \n\n\n\n25\n\nand minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic \nevents) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication \ncommittee.\nOverall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less \nthan 18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients \nin age stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients \n(1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. \nAdjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients \n(22.5%) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients \n(1.4%), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For \n3 patients (1.4%), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months. \nNo on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) developed post-\nthrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, \nwhich is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. \nThe absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa was approximately \n6.5 %.\nAfter oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran \nin plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 \nand 2.0 hours post administration.\n\nAbsorption\n\nA study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, \ndemonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth \nplasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma \nconcentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to \ncontributing factors such as anaesthesia, gastrointestinal paresis, and surgical effects independent of \nthe oral medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed \nabsorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran \nis rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration.\n\nFood does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma \nconcentrations by 2 hours.\n\nCmax and AUC were dose proportional.\n\nThe oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % after a single dose and 37 % at steady state \ncompared to the reference capsule formulation when the pellets are taken without the \nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, the integrity of the HPMC capsules \nshould always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally increased bioavailability of \ndabigatran etexilate (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\n\nLow (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was \nobserved. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60–70 L exceeded the volume of total body \nwater indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of \nradiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived \n\n\n\n26\n\nradioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the \nadministered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose \nby 168 hours post dose. \nDabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four \npositional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total \ndabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical \nmethods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of \napproximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate.\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of \n11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was \nobserved. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as \nshown in table 16.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal insufficiency\nIn phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran \netexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL \nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency.\n\nIn a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the \nexposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately \n2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and \n4.4).\n\nTable 16: Half-life of total dabigatran in healthy subjects and subjects with impaired renal \nfunction.\n\nglomerular filtration rate \n(CrCL,)\n\n[mL/min]\n\ngMean (gCV%; range) \nhalf-life \n\n[h] \n?80 13.4 (25.7 %; 11.0-21.6)\n\n?50-<80 15.3 (42.7 %;11.7-34.1) \n\n?30-<50 18.4 (18.5 %;13.3-23.0) \n<30 27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0)\n\nAdditionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label \nrandomised pharmacokinetic study in NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (defined as \ncreatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 75 mg twice daily.\nThis regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9 %), \nmeasured immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak \nconcentration of 202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6 %) measured two hours after the administration of the last \ndose.\n\nClearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 adult patients with end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow \nrate, four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted \nin a removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance\ncleared by dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The \nanticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD \nrelationship was not affected by the procedure.\n\n\n\n27\n\nElderly patients\nSpecific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the \nAUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects.\nThe effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % \nhigher trough concentration for subjects ? 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects \n<65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency \n(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBody weight\nThe dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in adult patients with a body weight \n>100 kg compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ?50 kg and \n<100 kg category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in \nadult patients <50 kg are available.\n\nGender\nActive substance exposure in the primary VTE prevention studies was about 40 % to 50 % higher in\nfemale patients and no dose adjustment is recommended.\n\nEthnic origin\nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic,\nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics.\n\nPaediatric population\nOral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted \nin exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT / PE. Based on the pooled analysis of \npharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1160.108, the observed geometric mean trough \nexposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to <2-year-old, 2 to <12-year-old and 12 \nto <18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nIn vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of \ncytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not \nshow any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin \n(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nEffects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \neffect of dabigatran.\n\nAn effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in \npre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were \ntoxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body \nweight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the \npre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the \ndams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding \nevents at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile \n\n\n\n28\n\nrats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in \nassociation with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile \ntoxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to \njuvenile animals.\n\nIn lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of \ndabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.\n\nDabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPrimary prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone \nelective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery.\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); age \n?75 years; heart failure (NYHA Class ?II); diabetes mellitus; hypertension.\n\nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less than \n18 years of age.\n\nFor age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPradaxa capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or older who are able to \nswallow the capsules whole. Pradaxa coated granules can be used in children aged less than 12 years\nas soon as the child is able to swallow soft food. Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution should \nonly be used in children aged less than 1 year.\n\nWhen changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated \nin the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed for the age and weight of the child.\n\nPrimary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery\n\nThe recommended doses of dabigatran etexilate and the duration of therapy for primary prevention of \nVTE in orthopaedic surgery are shown in table 1.\n\n\n\n32\n\nTable 1: Dose recommendations and duration of therapy for primary prevention of VTE in \northopaedic surgery\n\nTreatment initiation \non the day of surgery \n1-4 hours after \ncompleted surgery\n\nMaintenance \ndose starting \non the first day \nafter surgery\n\nDuration of \nmaintenance dose\n\nPatients following elective knee \nreplacement surgery\n\nsingle capsule of \n110 mg dabigatran \netexilate\n\n220 mg \ndabigatran \netexilate once \ndaily taken as \n2 capsules of \n110 mg\n\n10 days\n\nPatients following elective hip \nreplacement surgery 28-35 days\n\nDose reduction recommended\n\nPatients with moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \n(CrCL) 30-50 mL/min) single capsule of \n\n75 mg dabigatran \netexilate\n\n150 mg \ndabigatran \netexilate once \ndaily taken as \n2 capsules of \n75 mg\n\n10 days (knee \nreplacement \nsurgery) or 28-\n35 days (hip \nreplacement \nsurgery)\n\nPatients who receive concomitant \nverapamil*, amiodarone, quinidine \n\nPatients aged 75 or above \n\n*For patients with moderate renal impairment concomitantly treated with verapamil see Special \npopulations\n\nFor both surgeries, if haemostasis is not secured, initiation of treatment should be delayed. If treatment \nis not started on the day of surgery then treatment should be initiated with 2 capsules once daily.\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment\n\nIn all patients and especially in the elderly (>75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this \nage group:\n? Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to \n\ninitiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment \n(i.e. CrCL <30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n? Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during \ntreatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal \nproducts).\n\nThe method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method.\n\nMissed dose\n\nIt is recommended to continue with the remaining daily doses of dabigatran etexilate at the same time \nof the next day.\n\nNo double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be \ninstructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as \ndyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n33\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 24 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min), a dose reduction is recommended\n(see table 1 above and sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nConcomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. \namiodarone, quinidine or verapamil\n\nDosing should be reduced as indicated in table 1 (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation \ndabigatran etexilate and these medicinal products should be taken at the same time.\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with verapamil, a dose \nreduction of dabigatran etexilate to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nElderly\n\nFor elderly patients >75 years, a dose reduction is recommended (see table 1 above and sections 4.4 \nand 5.1).\n\nWeight\n\nThere is very limited clinical experience in patients with a body weight <50 kg or >110 kg at the \nrecommended posology. Given the available clinical and kinetic data no adjustment is necessary (see \nsection 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nGender\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of\nprimary prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or \ntotal knee replacement surgery.\n\n\n\n34\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk \nfactors (SPAF)\nTreatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE)\n\nThe recommended doses of dabigatran etexilate in the indications SPAF, DVT and PE are shown in \ntable 2.\n\nTable 2: Dose recommendations for SPAF, DVT and PE\n\nDose recommendation\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin adult patients with NVAF with one or \nmore risk factors (SPAF)\n\n300 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 150 mg \ncapsule twice daily\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE and prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE)\n\n300 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 150 mg \ncapsule twice daily following treatment with a \nparenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days\n\nDose reduction recommended\n\nPatients aged ?80 years\ndaily dose of 220 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one \n110 mg capsule twice daily Patients who receive concomitant verapamil\n\nDose reduction for consideration\n\nPatients between 75-80 years\n\ndaily dose of dabigatran etexilate of 300 mg or 220 mg \nshould be selected based on an individual assessment \nof the thromboembolic risk and the risk of bleeding \n\nPatients with moderate renal impairment \n(CrCL 30-50 mL/min)\n\nPatients with gastritis, esophagitis or \ngastroesophageal reflux\n\nOther patients at increased risk of bleeding\n\nFor DVT/PE the recommendation for the use of 220 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 110 mg \ncapsule twice daily is based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses and has not been \nstudied in this clinical setting. See further down and sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nIn case of intolerability to dabigatran etexilate, patients should be instructed to immediately consult \ntheir treating physician in order to be switched to alternate acceptable treatment options for prevention \nof stroke and systemic embolism associated with atrial fibrillation or for DVT/PE.\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment\n\nIn all patients and especially in the elderly (>75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this \nage group:\n? Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to \n\ninitiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment \n(i.e. CrCL <30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n? Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during \ntreatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal \nproducts).\n\nAdditional requirements in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and in patients aged over \n75 years:\n? Renal function should be assessed during treatment with dabigatran etexilate at least once a year \n\nor more frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal \n\n\n\n35\n\nfunction could decline or deteriorate (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of \nconcomitant use of certain medicinal products).\n\nThe method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method. \n\nDuration of use\n\nThe duration of use of dabigatran etexilate in the indications SPAF, DVT and PE are shown in table 3.\n\nTable 3: Duration of use for SPAF and DVT/PE\n\nIndication Duration of use\n\nSPAF Therapy should be continued long term.\n\nDVT/PE The duration of therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).\n\nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk factors \n(e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation) and longer durations should be based on \npermanent risk factors or idiopathic DVT or PE.\n\nMissed dose\n\nA forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. \nFrom 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose on, the missed dose should be omitted.\n\nNo double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be \ninstructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as \ndyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started\n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nThe starting time of the VKA should be adjusted based on CrCL as follows:\n\n? CrCL ? 50 mL/min, VKA should be started 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate\n? CrCL ?30-<50 mL/min, VKA should be started 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran \n\netexilate\n\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the International Normalised Ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\n\n\n\n36\n\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nCardioversion (SPAF)\n\nPatients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted.\n\nCatheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (SPAF)\n\nThere are no data available for 110 mg twice daily dabigatran etexilate treatment.\n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting (SPAF)\n\nPatients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo a PCI with stenting can be treated with \ndabigatran etexilate in combination with antiplatelets after haemostasis is achieved (see section 5.1).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nFor dose modifications in this population see table 2 above.\n\nPatients at risk of bleeding\n\nPatients with an increased bleeding risk (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2) should be closely \nmonitored clinically (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia). Dose adjustment should be decided at \nthe discretion of the physician, following assessment of the potential benefit and risk to an individual \npatient (see table 2 above). A coagulation test (see section 4.4) may help to identify patients with an \nincreased bleeding risk caused by excessive dabigatran exposure. When excessive dabigatran exposure \nis identified in patients at high risk of bleeding, a reduced dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule \ntwice daily is recommended. When clinically relevant bleeding occurs, treatment should be \ninterrupted.\n\nFor subjects with gastritis, esophagitis, or gastroesophageal reflux, a dose reduction may be considered\ndue to the elevated risk of major gastro-intestinal bleeding (see table 2 above and section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCL 50- ?80 mL/min). For \npatients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) the recommended dose of dabigatran \netexilate is also 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. However, for patients with high risk \nof bleeding, a dose reduction of dabigatran etexilate to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice \ndaily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in \npatients with renal impairment.\n\nConcomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. \namiodarone, quinidine or verapamil\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of amiodarone or quinidine (see sections 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.2).\n\nDose reductions are recommended for patients who receive concomitantly verapamil (see table 2\nabove and sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation dabigatran etexilate and verapamil should be taken at \nthe same time.\n\n\n\n37\n\nWeight\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended in \npatients with a body weight <50 kg (see section 4.4).\n\nGender\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of\nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF.\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients\n\nFor the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with \na parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be \ninitiated following previous treatment.\n\nDabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the \nevening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 12 hours \nas possible.\n\nThe recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules is based on the patient’s age and weight as \nshown in table 4. The table provides the single doses which are to be administered twice daily. The \ndose should be adjusted according to age and weight as treatment progresses.\n\n\n\n38\n\nTable 4: Single dabigatran etexilate dose in milligrams (mg) by weight in kilograms (kg) and \nage in years of the patient to be administered twice daily\n\nAge in years\n8 to <9 9 to \n\n<10\n10 to \n<11\n\n11 to \n<12\n\n12 to \n<13\n\n13 to \n<14\n\n14 to \n<15\n\n15 to \n<16\n\n16 to \n<17\n\n17 to \n<18\n\nW\nei\n\ng\nh\n\nt \n[k\n\ng\n]\n\n>81 300 mg\nas two 150 mg capsules\n\nor\nfour 75 mg capsules\n\n71 to <81\n\n61 to <71\n\n51 to <61\n\n260 mg\nas one 110 mg plus one 150 mg capsule\n\nor\none 110 mg plus two 75 mg capsules\n\n41 to <51\n220 mg\n\nas two 110 mg capsules\n\n31 to <41\n185 mg\n\nas one 75 mg plus one 110 mg capsule\n\n26 to <31\n150 mg\n\nas one 150 mg capsule\nor\n\ntwo 75 mg capsules21 to <26\n\n16 to <21\nOne 110 mg capsule\n\n13 to <16\n\n11 to <13\nOne \n75 mg\ncapsule\n\nMeans that no dosing recommendation can be provided.\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during treatment\n\nPrior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated \nusing the Schwartz formula.\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with an eGFR ?50 mL/min/1.73m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 4.\n\nWhile on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected \nthat the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain \nco-medications, etc).\n\nDuration of use\n\nThe duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment.\n\nMissed dose\n\nA forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. \nFrom 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. \nA double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken.\n\n\n\n39\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients or their \ncaregivers should be instructed to contact the treating physician if the patient develops gastrointestinal\nsymptoms such as dyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nPatients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate.\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the International Normalised Ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis medicinal product is for oral use.\nThe capsules can be taken with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed as a whole with a \nglass of water, to facilitate delivery to the stomach. \nPatients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see \nsections 5.2 and 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n? Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n? Severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) in adult patients\n? eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 in paediatric patients\n? Active clinically significant bleeding\n? Lesion or condition, if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities\n\n? Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), \noral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under specific circumstances. \nThese are switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is given at doses \nnecessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during \ncatheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.5)\n\n? Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival\n? Concomitant treatment with the following strong P-gp inhibitors: systemic ketoconazole, \n\ncyclosporine, itraconazole, dronedarone and the fixed-dose combination \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir (see section 4.5)\n\n? Prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment (see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n40\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaemorrhagic risk\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or\nwith concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet \naggregation. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or \nhaematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.\n\nFor adult patients in situations of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the \nanticoagulation effect of dabigatran is required, the specific reversal agent idarucizumab is available. \nThe efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. \nHaemodialysis can remove dabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, \ncoagulation factor concentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet \nconcentrates are other possible options (see also section 4.9).\n\nIn clinical trials, dabigatran etexilate was associated with higher rates of major gastrointestinal (GI) \nbleeding. An increased risk was seen in the elderly (?75 years) for the 150 mg twice daily dose \nregimen. Further risk factors (see also table 5) comprise co-medication with platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs\n(NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nRisk factors\n\nTable 5 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nTable 5: Factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nRisk factor\nPharmacodynamic and kinetic factors Age ?75 years\nFactors increasing dabigatran plasma levels Major:\n\n? Moderate renal impairment in adult \npatients (30-50 mL/min CrCL)\n\n? Strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.3 and \n4.5)\n\n? Mild to moderate P-gp inhibitor \nco-medication (e.g. amiodarone, verapamil, \nquinidine and ticagrelor; see section 4.5)\n\nMinor:\n? Low body weight (<50 kg) in adult patients\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions (see section 4.5) ? ASA and other platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel\n\n? NSAIDs\n? SSRIs or SNRIs\n? Other medicinal products which may \n\nimpair haemostasis\nDiseases / procedures with special \nhaemorrhagic risks\n\n? Congenital or acquired coagulation \ndisorders\n\n? Thrombocytopenia or functional platelet \ndefects\n\n? Recent biopsy, major trauma\n? Bacterial endocarditis\n? Esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal \n\nreflux\n\n\n\n41\n\nLimited data is available in adult patients <50 kg (see section 5.2). \n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric \npatients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5).\n\nPrecautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk\n\nFor the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9.\n\nBenefit-risk assessment \n\nThe presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, \nantiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major\nbleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the \nbenefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nLimited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with \nactive meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran \netexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nClose clinical surveillance\n\nClose observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, \nespecially if risk factors are combined (see table 5 above). Particular caution should be exercised when \ndabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp \ninhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.5).\nClose observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nNSAIDs (see section 4.5).\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nPatients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate (see also section 4.3).\n\nWhen severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated and \nuse of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) may be considered in adult patients. The efficacy and \nsafety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove \ndabigatran.\n\nUse of proton-pump inhibitors\n\nThe administration of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. In case \nof paediatric patients local labeling recommendations for proton pump inhibitors have to be followed.\n\nLaboratory coagulation parameters\n\nAlthough this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the \nmeasurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to \ndabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors. \nDiluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test \nvariability (see section 5.1).\nThe international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false \npositive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore, INR tests should not be performed.\n\n\n\n42\n\nTable 6 shows coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an \nincreased risk of bleeding. Respective thresholds for paediatric patients are not known (see section \n5.1).\n\nTable 6: Coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with \nan increased risk of bleeding.\n\nTest (trough value) Indication\nPrimary prevention of \nVTE in orthopaedic \nsurgery\n\nSPAF and DVT/PE\n\ndTT [ng/mL] >67 >200\nECT [x-fold upper limit of normal] No data >3\naPTT [x-fold upper limit of normal] >1.3 >2\nINR Should not be performed Should not be performed\n\nUse of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke\n\nThe use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be \nconsidered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal \n(ULN) according to the local reference range.\n\nSurgery and interventions\n\nPatients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for \nbleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran \netexilate.\n\nPatients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. There are no data available for \n110 mg twice daily dabigatran etexilate treatment in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial \nfibrillation (see section 4.2).\n\nCaution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and \nanticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency \nmay take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such \ncases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still \nimpaired.\n\nEmergency surgery or urgent procedures\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. When rapid reversal of the anticoagulation \neffect is required the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran is available for adult \npatients. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. \nHaemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nReversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. \nDabigatran etexilate treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if the \npatient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved.\n\nSubacute surgery/interventions\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery / intervention should be delayed if \npossible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding \nmay be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention.\n\n\n\n43\n\nElective surgery\n\nIf possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical \nprocedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may \nbe required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery. \n\nTable 7 summarises discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients.\n\nTable 7: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients\n\nRenal function\n(CrCL in\nmL/min)\n\nEstimated half-life \n(hours)\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be stopped before elective \nsurgery\n\nHigh risk of bleeding or \nmajor surgery\n\nStandard risk\n\n?80 ~ 13 2 days before 24 hours before\n?50-<80 ~ 15 2-3 days before 1-2 days before\n?30-<50 ~ 18 4 days before 2-3 days before (>48 hours)\n\nDiscontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients are summarised in \ntable 8.\n\nTable 8: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients\n\nRenal function\n(eGFR in mL/min/1.73m2)\n\nStop dabigatran before elective surgery\n\n>80 24 hours before\n50 – 80 2 days before\n<50 These patients have not been studied (see section 4.3).\n\nSpinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture\n\nProcedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function.\n\nThe risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture \nand by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least \n2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients \nrequire frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma.\n\nPostoperative phase\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should be resumed / started after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has \nbeen established.\n\nPatients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with reduced renal \nfunction (see also table 5), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nPatients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events\n\nThere are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and \ntherefore they should be treated with caution.\n\nHip fracture surgery\n\nThere is no data on the use of dabigatran etexilate in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. \nTherefore treatment is not recommended.\n\n\n\n44\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes >2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment \nexperience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate \nis not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any \nimpact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nInteraction with P-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma \nconcentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for \npatients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular \nfor patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 2-\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.\n\nMyocardial Infarction (MI)\n\nIn the phase III study RE-LY (SPAF, see section 5.1) the overall rate of MI was 0.82, 0.81, and \n0.64 % / year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily and \nwarfarin, respectively, an increase in relative risk for dabigatran of 29 % and 27 % compared to \nwarfarin. Irrespective of therapy, the highest absolute risk of MI was seen in the following subgroups, \nwith similar relative risk: patients with previous MI, patients ? 65 years with either diabetes or \ncoronary artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40 %, and patients with \nmoderate renal dysfunction. Furthermore a higher risk of MI was seen in patients concomitantly taking \nASA plus clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone.\n\nIn the three active controlled DVT/PE phase III studies, a higher rate of MI was reported in patients \nwho received dabigatran etexilate than in those who received warfarin: 0.4% vs. 0.2% in the short-\nterm RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies; and 0.8% vs. 0.1% in the long-term RE-MEDY trial. \nThe increase was statistically significant in this study (p=0.022).\n\nIn the RE-SONATE study, which compared dabigatran etexilate to placebo, the rate of MI was 0.1% \nfor patients who received dabigatran etexilate and 0.2% for patients who received placebo\n\nActive cancer patients (DVT/PE, paediatric VTE)\n\nThe efficacy and safety have not been established for DVT/PE patients with active cancer. There is \nlimited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nFor some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption \nmay be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTransporter interactions\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp \ninhibitors (see table 9) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.\n\n\n\n45\n\nIf not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or \nanaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. Dose reductions \nmay be required in combination with some P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nTable 9: Transporter interactions\n\nP-gp inhibitors\n\nConcomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\nKetoconazole Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values by 2.38-fold and \n2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold and \n2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once \ndaily. \n\nDronedarone When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total \ndabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, \nrespectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone bid, and about 2.1-fold \nand 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg.\n\nItraconazole,\ncyclosporine\n\nBased on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. \n\nGlecaprevir /\npibrentasvir\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of the \nP-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase exposure of \ndabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nTacrolimus Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-\ngp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate has not been \nclinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited clinical data with \nanother P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the inhibition of P-gp with \ntacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong P-gp inhibitors. \n\nCautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) \n\nVerapamil When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the \nCmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this change \ndiffers depending on timing of administration and formulation of verapamil (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nThe greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an \nimmediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to the \ndabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC by about \n2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration of an \nextended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and AUC by about \n1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increase of Cmax by \nabout 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold).\n\nThere was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours \nafter dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC by about \n1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 2 hours.\n\nAmiodarone When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg\namiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active \nmetabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were \nincreased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the long half-life \nof amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks after \n\n\n\n46\n\ndiscontinuation of amiodarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\nQuinidine Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1,000 mg. \n\nDabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day \neither with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on \naverage by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with concomitant quinidine (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nClarithromycin When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with \ndabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold and \nCmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. \n\nTicagrelor When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered \nsimultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC and \nCmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After multiple doses \nof ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. the increase of dabigatran exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-\nfold for Cmax and AUC, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss by \n1.49-fold  and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\nwas reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran \netexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended administration for \nstart of ticagrelor with a loading dose.\n\nConcomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor b.i.d. (maintenance dose) with \n110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\n1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone.\n\nPosaconazole Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. \nCaution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with \nposaconazole.\n\nP-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant use should be avoided.\n\ne.g. rifampicin, \nSt. John´s wort \n(Hypericum \nperforatum), \ncarbamazepine, \nor phenytoin\n\nConcomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran \nconcentrations.\n\nPre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for \n7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5% and 67%, \nrespectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure \nclose to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No further \nincrease in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.\n\nProtease inhibitors such as ritonavir\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\ne.g. ritonavir \nand its \ncombinations \nwith other \nprotease \ninhibitors\n\nThese affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and \nare therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran etexilate.\n\n\n\n47\n\nP-gp substrate\n\nDigoxin In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was \nco-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant \nchanges on dabigatran exposure have been observed.\n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nThere is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of \nbleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated \nheparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, \ndesirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral \nanticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa \nreceptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4).\n\nFrom the data collected in the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1) it was observed that the \nconcomitant use of other oral or parenteral anticoagulants increases major bleeding rates with both \ndabigatran etexilate and warfarin by approximately 2.5-fold, mainly related to situations when \nswitching from one anticoagulant to another (see section 4.3). Furthermore, concomitant use of \nantiplatelets, ASA or clopidogrel approximately doubled major bleeding rates with both dabigatran\netexilate and warfarin (see section 4.4).\n\nUFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3).\n\nTable 10: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with \nincreased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With \nchronic use in the RE-LY study, NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by \napproximately 50% on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin.\n\nClopidogrel In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran \netexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times \ncompared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss and \nthe coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation \nas measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined \ntreatment and the respective mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or \n600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40% (see \nsection 4.4) .\n\nASA Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the \nrisk for any bleeding from 12% to 18% and 24% with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nLMWH The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not \nbeen specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily \n40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to \ndabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of dabigatran etexilate \n(single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity was observed after \ndabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that after \ntreatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over \neffect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran \nrelated anti-coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of \nenoxaparin.\n\n\n\n48\n\nOther interactions\n\nTable 11: Other interactions\n\nSelective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake \ninhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nSSRIs, SNRIs SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups,\n\nSubstances influencing gastric pH\n\nPantoprazole When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran \nAUC of approximately 30% was observed. Pantoprazole and other proton-pump \ninhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and concomitant \nPPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa.\n\nRanitidine Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran.\n\nInteractions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no \nin vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions \nare not expected with dabigatran.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women.\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown.\n\nPradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding.\nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data available.\n\nIn animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations \nand an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure \nlevel compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence \non male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5- to 10-fold higher plasma \nexposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an \n\n\n\n49\n\nincrease in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre- and post-natal study, an \nincrease in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to \na plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64,000 patients; \nthereof approximately 35,000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate.\nIn total, about 9% of patients treated for elective hip or knee surgery (short-term treatment for up to \n42 days), 22% of patients with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism (long-term treatment for up to 3 years), 14% of patients treated for DVT/PE and 15% of \npatients treated for DVT/PE prevention experienced adverse reactions.\n\nThe most commonly reported events are bleedings occurring in approximately 14% of patients treated \nshort-term for elective hip or knee replacement surgery, 16.6% in patients with atrial fibrillation \ntreated long-term for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, and in 14.4% of adult patients \ntreated for DVT/PE. Furthermore, bleeding occurred in 19.4% of patients in the DVT/PE prevention \ntrial RE-MEDY (adult patients) and in 10.5% of patients in the DVT/PE prevention trial RE-SONATE\n(adult patients). \n\nSince the patient populations treated in the three indications are not comparable and bleeding events \nare distributed over several System Organ Classes (SOC), a summary description of major and any \nbleeding are broken down by indication and provided in tables 13-17 below.\n\nAlthough low in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of \nlocation, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 12 shows the adverse reactions identified from studies and post-marketing data in the \nindications primary VTE prevention after hip or knee replacement surgery, prevention of \nthromboembolic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, DVT/PE treatment \nand DVT/PE prevention. They are ranked under headings of System Organ Class (SOC) and \nfrequency using the following convention: very common (?1/10), common (?1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (?1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (?1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 12: Adverse reactions\n\nFrequency\n\nSOC / Preferred term.

The signs, symptoms, and severity \n(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding \nand/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were \nseen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. \nThus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of \nvalue to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. \nthose patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis\nor strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may \npresent as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and \nunexplained shock.\n\nKnown bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to \nhypoperfusion have been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. For adult patients, a specific \nreversal agent for dabigatran, idarucizumab, is available in case of uncontrollable bleeding (see \nSection 4.9).\n\nPrimary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery\n\nThe table 13 shows the number (%) of patients experiencing the adverse reaction bleeding during the \ntreatment period in the VTE prevention in the two pivotal clinical trials, according to dose.\n\nTable 13: Number (%) of patients experiencing the adverse reaction bleeding\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg once daily\nN (%)\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n220 mg once daily\nN (%)\n\nEnoxaparin\n\nN (%)\nTreated 1,866 (100.0) 1,825 (100.0) 1,848 (100.0)\nMajor bleeding 24 (1.3) 33 (1.8) 27 (1.5)\nAny bleeding 258 (13.8) 251 (13.8) 247 (13.4)\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors\n\nThe table 14 shows bleeding events broken down to major and any bleeding in the pivotal study \ntesting the prevention of thromboembolic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial \n\n\n\n52\n\nfibrillation.\n\nTable 14: Bleeding events in a study testing the prevention of thromboembolic stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin \n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022\nMajor bleeding 347 (2.92 %) 409 (3.40 %) 426 (3.61 %)\n\nIntracranial bleeding 27 (0.23 %) 39 (0.32 %) 91 (0.77 %)\nGI bleeding 134 (1.13 %) 192 (1.60 %) 128 (1.09 %)\nFatal bleeding 26 (0.22 %) 30 (0.25 %) 42 (0.36 %)\n\nMinor bleeding 1,566 (13.16 %) 1,787 (14.85 %) 1,931 (16.37 %)\nAny bleeding 1,759 (14.78 %) 1,997 (16.60 %) 2,169 (18.39 %)\n\nSubjects randomised to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily had a \nsignificantly lower risk for life-threatening bleeds and intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [p \n<0.05]. Both dose strengths of dabigatran etexilate had also a statistically significant lower total bleed \nrate. Subjects randomised to 110 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly lower risk for \nmajor bleeds compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.81 [p=0.0027]). Subjects randomised to 150 mg \ndabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly higher risk for major GI bleeds compared with \nwarfarin (hazard ratio 1.48 [p=0.0005]. This effect was seen primarily in patients ?75 years.\nThe clinical benefit of dabigatran with regard to stroke and systemic embolism prevention and \ndecreased risk of ICH compared to warfarin is preserved across individual subgroups, e.g. renal \nimpairment, age, concomitant medicinal product use such as anti-platelets or P-gp inhibitors. While \ncertain patient subgroups are at an increased risk of major bleeding when treated with an \nanticoagulant, the excess bleeding risk for dabigatran is due to GI bleeding, typically seen within the \nfirst 3-6 months following initiation of dabigatran etexilate therapy.\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment)\n\nTable 15 shows bleeding events in the pooled pivotal studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II testing \nthe treatment of DVT and PE.

The \nreporting rate was estimated as 7 events per 1 million patient years for agranulocytosis and as 5 events \nper 1 million patient years for neutropenia.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients was studied in two phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1160.108). In total,\n328 paediatric patients had been treated with dabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and \nweight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate.\n\nOverall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults.\n\nIn total, 26% of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of \nrecurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 18 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and \nprevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ \nClass (SOC) and frequency using the following convention: very common (?1/10), common (?1/100 \nto <1/10), uncommon (?1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (?1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 18: Adverse reactions\n\nFrequency\n\nSOC / Preferred term. treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\n\n\n55\n\nAnaemia Common\nHaemoglobin decreased Uncommon\nThrombocytopenia Common\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon\nNeutropenia Uncommon\nAgranulocytosis Not known\n\nImmune system disorder\nDrug hypersensitivity Uncommon\nRash Common\nPruritus Uncommon\nAnaphylactic reaction Not known\nAngioedema Not known\nUrticaria Common\nBronchospasm Not known\n\nNervous system disorders\nIntracranial haemorrhage Uncommon\n\nVascular disorders\nHaematoma Common\nHaemorrhage Not known\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis Common\nHaemoptysis Uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon\nAbdominal pain Uncommon\nDiarrhoea Common\nDyspepsia Common\nNausea Common \nRectal haemorrhage Uncommon\nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Not known\nGastrointestinal ulcer, including \noesophageal ulcer\n\nNot known\n\nGastroesophagitis Uncommon\nGastroesophageal reflux disease Common\nVomiting Common\nDysphagia Uncommon\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nHepatic function abnormal/ Liver \nfunction Test abnormal\n\nNot known\n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nHepatic enzyme increased Common\nHyperbilirubinaemia Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorder\nSkin haemorrhage Uncommon \nAlopecia Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nHaemarthrosis Not known\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nGenitourological haemorrhage, \nincluding haematuria\n\nUncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site haemorrhage Not known\nCatheter site haemorrhage Not known\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\n\n\n\n56\n\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon\nIncision site haemorrhage Not known\n\nBleeding reactions\n\nIn the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1%) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5%) a \nclinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9%) a minor bleeding event. The \nfrequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to <18 years: 28.6%) than \nin the younger age groups (birth to <2 years: 23.3%; 2 to <12 years: 16.2%). Major or severe bleeding, \nregardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended expose the patient to increased risk of \nbleeding.\n\nIn case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections\n4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the \ntime by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional \nmeasures e.g. dialysis have been initiated.\n\nExcessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran \nis excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding \nis low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this \napproach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).\n\nManagement of bleeding complications\n\nIn the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and \nthe source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive\ntreatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the \nprescriber’s discretion.\n\nFor adult patients in situations when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is required\nthe specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran is \navailable. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nCoagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken \ninto account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in \nreversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and \nalso on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become \nunreliable following administration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be \nexercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of \nplatelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal \nproducts have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's \njudgement.\n\nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n57\n\nmajor bleedings.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07.\n\nMechanism of action \n\nDabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. \nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible \ndirect thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma.\nSince thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the \ncoagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free \nthrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant \nactivity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral \nadministration in various animal models of thrombosis.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant \neffect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT.\n\nThe calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma \nconcentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the \ncalibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of \nquantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered.\n\nThe ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nThe aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation \nintensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable \nfor precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of \ndabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value \nindicates that the patient is anticoagulated.\n\nIn general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran \nlevels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile \nof dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough (for aPTT \nthresholds see section 4.4, table 6) is considered to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nPrimary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery\n\nSteady state (after day 3) geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around \n2 hours after 220 mg dabigatran etexilate administration, was 70.8 ng/mL, with a range of \n35.2-162 ng/mL (25th–75th percentile range).The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, \nmeasured at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 24 hours after a 220 mg dabigatran dose), was on \naverage 22.0 ng/mL, with a range of 13.0-35.7 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range).\n\nIn a dedicated study exclusively in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance, \nCrCL 30-50 mL/min) treated with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg QD, the dabigatran geometric mean \n\n\n\n58\n\ntrough concentration, measured at the end of the dosing interval, was on average 47.5 ng/mL, with a \nrange of 29.6 - 72.2 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range).\n\nIn patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery with 220 mg \ndabigatran etexilate once daily,\n? the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations was 67 ng/mL, measured at trough \n\n(20-28 hours after the previous dose) (see section 4.4 and 4.9),\n? the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (20-28 hours after the previous dose) was 51 seconds, \n\nwhich would be 1.3-fold upper limit of normal.\n\nThe ECT was not measured in patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement \nsurgery with 220 mg dabigatran etexilate once daily.\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors\n(SPAF)\n\nSteady state geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 2 hours after \n150 mg dabigatran etexilate administration twice daily, was 175 ng/mL, with a range of \n117-275 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, \nmeasured at trough in the morning, at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg \ndabigatran evening dose), was on average 91.0 ng/mL, with a range of 61.0-143 ng/mL\n(25th-75th percentile range).\n\nFor patients with NVAF treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism with 150 mg \ndabigatran etexilate twice daily,\n? the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after \n\nthe previous dose) was about 200 ng/mL,\n? an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 3-fold upper \n\nlimit of normal refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 103 seconds,\n? an aPTT ratio greater than 2-fold upper limit of normal (aPTT prolongation of about \n\n80 seconds), at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) reflects the 90th percentile of \nobservations.\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE)\n\nIn patients treated for DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily, the dabigatran \ngeometric mean trough concentration, measured within 10?16 hours after dose, at the end of the \ndosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran evening dose), was 59.7 ng/ml, with a range \nof 38.6 - 94.5 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range). For treatment of DVT and PE, with dabigatran \netexilate 150 mg twice daily,\n? the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after \n\nthe previous dose) was about 146 ng/ml,\n? an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 2.3-fold \n\ncompared to baseline refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 74 seconds,\n? the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) was 62 seconds, \n\nwhich would be 1.8-fold compared to baseline.\n\nIn patients treated for prevention of recurrent of DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice \ndaily no pharmacokinetic data are available. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nEthnic origin\n\nNo clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or \nChinese patients were observed.\n\n\n\n59\n\nClinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery\n\nIn 2 large randomised, parallel group, double-blind, dose-confirmatory trials, patients undergoing \nelective major orthopaedic surgery (one for knee replacement surgery and one for hip replacement \nsurgery) received 75 mg or 110 mg dabigatran etexilate within 1-4 hours of surgery followed by \n150 mg or 220 mg once daily thereafter, haemostasis having been secured, or enoxaparin 40 mg on the \nday prior to surgery and daily thereafter.\nIn the RE-MODEL trial (knee replacement) treatment was for 6-10 days and in the RE-NOVATE trial \n(hip replacement) for 28-35 days. Totals of 2,076 patients (knee) and 3,494 (hip) were treated \nrespectively.\n\nComposite of total VTE (including PE, proximal and distal DVT, whatever symptomatic or \nasymptomatic detected by routine venography) and all-cause mortality constituted the primary \nend-point for both studies. Composite of major VTE (including PE and proximal DVT, whatever \nsymptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and VTE-related mortality constituted \na secondary end-point and is considered of better clinical relevance.\nResults of both studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of 220 mg and 150 mg dabigatran \netexilate were statistically non-inferior to that of enoxaparin on total VTE and all-cause mortality. The \npoint estimate for incidence of Major VTE and VTE related mortality for the 150 mg dose was slightly \nworse than enoxaparin (table 19). Better results were seen with the 220 mg dose where the point \nestimate of Major VTE was slightly better than enoxaparin (table 19).\n\nThe clinical studies have been conducted in a patient population with a mean age >65 years.\n\nThere were no differences in the phase 3 clinical studies for efficacy and safety data between men and \nwomen.\n\nIn the studied patient population of RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE (5,539 patients treated), 51% \nsuffered from concomitant hypertension, 9% from concomitant diabetes, 9% from concomitant \ncoronary artery disease and 20% had a history of venous insufficiency. None of these diseases showed \nan impact on the effects of dabigatran on VTE-prevention or bleeding rates.\n\nData for the major VTE and VTE-related mortality endpoint were homogeneous with regards to the \nprimary efficacy endpoint and are shown in table 19.\n\nData for the total VTE and all cause mortality endpoint are shown in table 20.\n\nData for adjudicated major bleeding endpoints are shown in table 21 below.\n\nTable 19: Analysis of major VTE and VTE-related mortality during the treatment period in the \nRE-MODEL and the RE-NOVATE orthopaedic surgery studies.\n\nTrial Dabigatran etexilate\n220 mg once daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg once daily\n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg\n\nRE-NOVATE (hip)\nN 909 888 917\nIncidences (%) 28 (3.1) 38 (4.3) 36 (3.9)\nRisk ratio over enoxaparin 0.78 1.09\n95 % CI 0.48, 1.27 0.70, 1.70\nRE-MODEL (knee)\nN 506 527 511\nIncidences (%) 13 (2.6) 20 (3.8) 18 (3.5)\nRisk ratio over enoxaparin 0.73 1.08\n95 % CI 0.36, 1.47 0.58, 2.01\n\n\n\n60\n\nTable 20: Analysis of total VTE and all cause mortality during the treatment period in the \nRE-NOVATE and the RE-MODEL orthopaedic surgery studies.\n\nTrial Dabigatran etexilate\n220 mg once daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg once daily\n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg\n\nRE-NOVATE (hip)\nN 880 874 897\nIncidences (%) 53 (6.0) 75 (8.6) 60 (6.7)\nRisk ratio over enoxaparin 0.9 1.28\n95 % CI (0.63, 1.29) (0.93, 1.78)\nRE-MODEL (knee)\nN 503 526 512\nIncidences (%) 183 (36.4) 213 (40.5) 193 (37.7)\nRisk ratio over enoxaparin 0.97 1.07\n95 % CI (0.82, 1.13) (0.92, 1.25)\n\nTable 21: Major bleeding events by treatment in the individual RE-MODEL and the \nRE-NOVATE studies.\n\nTrial Dabigatran etexilate\n220 mg once daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg once daily\n\nEnoxaparin\n40 mg\n\nRE-NOVATE (hip)\nTreated patients N 1,146 1,163 1,154\nNumber of MBE N(%) 23 (2.0) 15 (1.3) 18 (1.6)\nRE-MODEL (knee)\nTreated patients N 679 703 694\nNumber of MBE N(%) 10 (1.5) 9 (1.3) 9 (1.3)\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors\n\nThe clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate is derived from the RE-LY study \n(Randomised Evaluation of Long–term anticoagulant therapy) a multi-centre, multi-national, \nrandomised parallel group study of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110 mg and 150 mg \ntwice daily) compared to open-label warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk \nof stroke and systemic embolism. The primary objective in this study was to determine if dabigatran \netexilate was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint stroke and \nsystemic embolism. Statistical superiority was also analysed.\n\nIn the RE-LY study, a total of 18,113 patients were randomised, with a mean age of 71.5 years and a \nmean CHADS2 score of 2.1. The patient population was 64% male, 70% Caucasian and 16% Asian. \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR)\n(INR 2-3) was 64.4% (median TTR 67%).\n\nThe RE-LY study demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, at a dose of 110 mg twice daily, is \nnon-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in subjects with atrial \nfibrillation, with a reduced risk of ICH, total bleeding and major bleeding. The dose of 150 mg twice \ndaily reduces significantly the risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, ICH and total \nbleeding compared to warfarin. Major bleeding rates with this dose were comparable to warfarin.\nMyocardial infarction rates were slightly increased with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily and \n150 mg twice daily compared to warfarin (hazard ratio 1.29; p=0.0929 and hazard ratio 1.27; \np=0.1240, respectively). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of dabigatran \netexilate compared to warfarin diminish.\n\n\n\n61\n\nTables 22-24 display details of key results in the overall population:\n\nTable 22: Analysis of first occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism (primary endpoint) \nduring the study period in RE-LY.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin \n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022\n\nStroke and/or systemic \nembolism\n\nIncidences (%) 183 (1.54) 135 (1.12) 203 (1.72)\nHazard ratio over \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.89 (0.73, 1.09) 0.65 (0.52, 0.81)\n\np value superiority p=0.2721 p=0.0001\n% refers to yearly event rate\n\nTable 23: Analysis of first occurrence of ischemic or haemorrhagic strokes during the study \nperiod in RE-LY.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin\n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022\nStroke\n\nIncidences (%) 171 (1.44) 123 (1.02) 187 (1.59)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.91 (0.74, 1.12) 0.64 (0.51, 0.81)\n\np-value 0.3553 0.0001\nSystemic embolism\n\nIncidences (%) 15 (0.13) 13 (0.11) 21 (0.18)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.71 (0.37, 1.38) 0.61 (0.30, 1.21)\n\np-value 0.3099 0.1582\nIschemic stroke\n\nIncidences (%) 152 (1.28) 104 (0.86) 134 (1.14)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI) \n\n1.13 (0.89, 1.42) 0.76 (0.59, 0.98)\n\np-value 0.3138 0.0351\nHaemorrhagic stroke\n\nIncidences (%) 14 (0.12) 12 (0.10) 45 (0.38)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.31 (0.17, 0.56) 0.26 (0.14, 0.49)\n\np-value 0.0001 <0.0001\n% refers to yearly event rate \n\n\n\n62\n\nTable 24: Analysis of all cause and cardiovascular survival during the study period in RE-LY.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin\n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022 \nAll-cause mortality\n\nIncidences (%) 446 (3.75) 438 (3.64) 487 (4.13)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.91 (0.80, 1.03) 0.88 (0.77, 1.00)\n\np-value 0.1308 0.0517\nVascular mortality\n\nIncidences (%) 289 (2.43) 274 (2.28) 317 (2.69)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.90 (0.77, 1.06) 0.85 (0.72, 0.99)\n\np-value 0.2081 0.0430\n% refers to yearly event rate \n\nTables 25-26 display results of the primary efficacy and safety endpoint in relevant sub-populations:\n\nFor the primary endpoint, stroke and systemic embolism, no subgroups (i.e., age, weight, gender, renal \nfunction, ethnicity, etc.) were identified with a different risk ratio compared to warfarin.\n\nTable 25: Hazard Ratio and 95 % CI for stroke/systemic embolism by subgroups\n\nEndpoint Dabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily vs. Warfarin\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily vs. warfarin\n\nAge (years)\n<65 1.10 (0.64, 1.87) 0.51 (0.26, 0.98)\n\n65? and <75 0.86 (0.62, 1.19) 0.67 (0.47, 0.95)\n?75 0.88 (0.66, 1.17) 0.68 (0.50, 0.92)\n?80 0.68 (0.44, 1.05) 0.67 (0.44, 1.02)\n\nCrCL(mL/min)\n30? and <50 0.89 (0.61, 1.31) 0.48 (0.31, 0.76)\n50? and <80 0.91 (0.68, 1.20) 0.65 (0.47, 0.88)\n\n?80 0.81 (0.51, 1.28) 0.69 (0.43, 1.12)\n\nFor the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding there was an interaction of treatment effect and age. \nThe relative risk of bleeding with dabigatran compared to warfarin increased with age.

Patients \nwere eligible for the RELY-ABLE trial if they had not permanently discontinued study medication at \nthe time of their final RE-LY study visit. Enrolled patients continued to receive the same double-blind \ndabigatran etexilate dose randomly allocated in RE-LY, for up to 43 months of follow up after RE-LY \n(total mean follow-up RE-LY + RELY-ABLE, 4.5 years). There were 5897 patients enrolled, \nrepresenting 49 % of patients originally randomly assigned to receive dabigatran etexilate in RE-LY \nand 86 % of RELY-ABLE–eligible patients. \nDuring the additional 2.5 years of treatment in RELY-ABLE, with a maximum exposure of over \n6 years (total exposure in RELY + RELY-ABLE), the long-term safety profile of dabigatran etexilate \nwas confirmed for both test doses 110 mg b.i.d. and 150 mg b.i.d.. No new safety findings were \nobserved.\nThe rates of outcome events including, major bleed and other bleeding events were consistent with \nthose seen in RE-LY.\n\nData from non-interventional studies\n\nA non-interventional study (GLORIA-AF) prospectively collected (in its second phase) safety and \neffectiveness data in newly diagnosed NVAF patients on dabigatran etexilate in a real-world setting. \nThe study included 4,859 patients on dabigatran etexilate (55% treated with 150 mg bid, 43% treated \nwith 110 mg bid, 2% treated with 75 mg bid). Patients were followed-up for 2 years. The mean \nCHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were 1.9 and 1.2, respectively. Mean on-therapy follow-up time was \n18.3 months. Major bleeding occurred in 0.97 per 100 patient-years. Life-threatening bleeding was \nreported in 0.46 per 100 patient-years, intracranial haemorrhage in 0.17 per 100 patient-years and \ngastrointestinal bleeding in 0.60 per 100 patient-years. Stroke occurred in 0.65 per 100 patient-years. \n\nIn addition, in a non-interventional study [Graham DJ et al., Circulation. 2015;131:157-164] in more \nthan 134,000 elderly patients with NVAF in the United States (contributing more than 37,500 patient-\nyears of on-therapy follow-up time) dabigatran etexilate (84% patients treated with 150 mg bid, 16% \npatients treated with 75 mg bid) was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio \n0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 – 0.96), intracranial haemorrhage (hazard ratio 0.34, CI 0.26 –\n0.46), and mortality (hazard ratio 0.86, CI 0.77 – 0.96) and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding \n\n(hazard ratio 1.28, CI 1.14 – 1.44) compared to warfarin. No difference was found for major bleeding \n(hazard ratio 0.97, CI 0.88 – 1.07).\n\nThese observations in real-world settings are consistent with the established safety and efficacy profile \nfor dabigatran etexilate in the RE-LY study in this indication.\n\n\n\n64\n\nPatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting\n\nA prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study (Phase IIIb) to evaluate dual-\ntherapy with dabigatran etexilate (110 mg or 150 mg bid) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor (P2Y12 \nantagonist) vs. triple-therapy with warfarin (adjusted to a INR 2.0 – 3.0) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor \nand ASA was conducted in 2725 patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI \nwith stenting (RE-DUAL PCI). Patients were randomised to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg bid dual-\ntherapy, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg bid dual-therapy or warfarin triple-therapy. Elderly patients \noutside of the United States (?80 years of age for all countries, ?70 years of age for Japan) were \nrandomly assigned to the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg dual-therapy group or the warfarin triple-therapy \ngroup. The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint of major bleeds based on ISTH definition or \nclinically relevant non-major bleeding event.\n\nThe incidence of the primary endpoint was 15.4% (151 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg \ndual-therapy group as compared with 26.9% (264 patients) in the warfarin triple-therapy group (HR \n0.52; 95% CI 0.42, 0.63; P<0.0001 for non-inferiority and P<0.0001 for superiority) and 20.2% \n(154 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 25.7 % \n(196 patients) in the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58, 0.88; \nP<0.0001 for non-inferiority and P=0.002 for superiority). As part of the descriptive analysis, TIMI \n(Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding events was lower in both dabigatran etexilate \ndual-therapy groups than in the warfarin triple-therapy group: 14 events (1.4%) in the dabigatran \netexilate 110 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 37 events (3.8%) in the warfarin triple-therapy \ngroup (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20, 0.68; P=0.002) and 16 events (2.1%) in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg \ndual-therapy group as compared with 30 events (3.9%) in the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy \ngroup (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.28, 0.93; P=0.03). Both dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy groups had lower \nrates of intracranial hemorrhage than the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group: 3 events (0.3%) \nin the 110 mg dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 10 events (1.0%) in the \nwarfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.08, 1.07; P=0.06) and 1 event (0.1%) in the 150 mg \ndabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 8 events (1.0%) in the corresponding \nwarfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.12; 95% CI 0.02, 0.98; P=0.047). The incidence of the composite \nefficacy endpoint of death, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic \nembolism) or unplanned revascularization in the two dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy groups \ncombined was non-inferior to the warfarin triple-therapy group (13.7% vs. 13.4% respectively; HR \n1.04; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.29; P=0.0047 for non-inferiority).There were no statistical differences in the \nindividual components of the efficacy endpoints between either dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy \ngroups and warfarin triple-therapy.\n\nThis study demonstrated that dual-therapy with dabigatran etexilate and a P2Y12 antagonist \nsignificantly reduced the risk of bleeding vs. warfarin triple-therapy with non-inferiority for composite \nof thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stenting.\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment)\n\nThe efficacy and safety was investigated in two multi-center, randomised, double blind, parallel-\ngroup, replicate studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II. These studies compared dabigatran etexilate \n(150 mg bid) with warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) in patients with acute DVT and/or PE. The primary \nobjective of these studies was to determine if dabigatran etexilate was non-inferior to warfarin in \nreducing the occurrence of the primary endpoint which was the composite of recurrent symptomatic \nDVT and/or PE and related deaths within the 6 month treatment period. \n\nIn the pooled RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies, a total of 5,153 patients were randomised and \n5,107 were treated.\n\nThe duration of treatment with fixed dose of dabigatran was 174.0 days without coagulation \nmonitoring. For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0 to 3.0) \nwas 60.6%. \n\n\n\n65\n\nThe trials, demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior\nto the treatment with warfarin (non-inferiority margin for RE-COVER, and RE-COVER II: 3.6 for risk \ndifference and 2.75 for hazard ratio). \n\nTable 27: Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (VTE is a composite of \nDVT and/or PE) until the end of post-treatment period for the pooled studies RE-\nCOVER and RE-COVER II\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily \n\nWarfarin\n\nTreated patients 2,553 2,554 \nRecurrent symptomatic \nVTE and VTE-related \ndeath\n\n68 ( 2.7 %) 62 ( 2.4 %)\n\nHazard ratio vs warfarin\n(95% confidence \ninterval)\n\n1.09\n(0.77, 1.54)\n\nSecondary efficacy \nendpoints\nRecurrent symptomatic \nVTE and all-cause \ndeaths\n\n109 (4.3 %) 104 (4.1 %)\n\n95 % confidence \ninterval \n\n3.52, 5.13 3.34, 4.91\n\nSymptomatic DVT 45 (1.8 %) 39 (1.5 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n1.29, 2.35 1.09, 2.08\n\nSymptomatic PE 27 (1.1 %) 26 (1.0 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n0.70, 1.54 0.67, 1.49\n\nVTE-related deaths 4 (0.2 %) 3 (0.1 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n0.04, 0.40 0.02, 0.34\n\nAll-cause deaths 51 (2.0 %) 52 (2.0 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n1.49, 2.62 1.52, 2.66\n\nPrevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE prevention)\n\nTwo randomised, parallel group, double-blind studies were performed in patients previously treated \nwith anticoagulation therapy.

A total of 2,866 patients were randomised and 2,856 patients \nwere treated. Duration of dabigatran etexilate treatment ranged from 6 to 36 months (median \n534.0 days).

The intended therapy was 6 months dabigatran \netexilate 150 mg twice daily without need for monitoring. \n\nRE-SONATE demonstrated dabigatran etexilate was superior to placebo for the prevention of \nrecurrent symptomatic DVT/PE events including unexplained deaths, with a risk reduction from 5.6% \nto 0.4% (relative risk reduction 92% based on hazard ratio ) during the treatment period (p<0.0001). \nAll secondary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints showed \nsuperiority of dabigatran etexilate over placebo.\n\nThe study included observational follow-up for 12 months after the conclusion of treatment. After \ndiscontinuation of study medication the effect was maintained until the end of the follow-up, \nindicating that the initial treatment effect of dabigatran etexilate was sustained.

More thromboembolic \nevents (mainly strokes and symptomatic/asymptomatic prosthetic valve thrombosis) and more \nbleeding events were observed with dabigatran etexilate than with warfarin. In the early post-operative \npatients, major bleeding manifested predominantly as haemorrhagic pericardial effusions, specifically \nin patients who started dabigatran etexilate early (i.e. on Day 3) after heart valve replacement surgery \n(see section 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPradaxa in all subsets of the paediatric population for the indication of primary prevention of VTE in \npatients who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery\nand the indication of prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n\n\n68\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients\n\nThe DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate \ncompared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, non-\ninferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-\nappropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses \nadjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or \nvitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a \ncomposite endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and \nfreedom from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and \nintracranial abscess.\nIn total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran \netexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were \n12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than \n2 years.\nOf the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients \n(42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus \nresolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The \ncorresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent \nresults were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the \ntreatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the \n3 different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the \ndabigatran etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1%) and 7/13 (53.8%) for patients \nfrom birth to <2 years, 21/43 (48.8%) and 12/21 (57.1%) for patients aged 2 to <12 years, and 47/112 \n(42.0%) and 19/56 (33.9%) for patients aged 12 to <18 years.\nAdjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and \n2 patients (2.2%) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first \nmajor bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6%) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients \n(24.4%) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The \ncombined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major \n(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4%) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group \nand 3 (3.3%) patients in the SOC group.\n\nAn open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was\nconducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the \npresence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least \n3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. \nEligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, \ncoated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a \nmaximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major \nand minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic \nevents) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication \ncommittee.\nOverall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less \nthan 18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients \nin age stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients \n(1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. \nAdjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients \n(22.5%) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients \n(1.4%), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For \n3 patients (1.4%), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months. \nNo on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) developed post-\nthrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months.\n\n\n\n69\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, \nwhich is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. \nThe absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa was approximately \n6.5%.\nAfter oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran \nin plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 \nand 2.0 hours post administration.\n\nAbsorption\n\nA study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, \ndemonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth \nplasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma \nconcentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to \ncontributing factors such as anaesthesia, GI paresis, and surgical effects independent of the oral \nmedicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed \nabsorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran \nis rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration.\n\nFood does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma \nconcentrations by 2 hours.\n\nCmax and AUC were dose proportional.\n\nThe oral bioavailability may be increased by 75% after a single dose and 37% at steady state \ncompared to the reference capsule formulation when the pellets are taken without the \nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, the integrity of the HPMC capsules \nshould always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally increased bioavailability of \ndabigatran etexilate (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\n\nLow (34-35%) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was \nobserved. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60–70 L exceeded the volume of total body \nwater indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of \nradiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived \nradioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85%). Faecal excretion accounted for 6% of the \nadministered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94% of the administered dose \nby 168 hours post dose.\nDabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four \npositional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10% of total \ndabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical \nmethods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of \napproximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate.\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of \n11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was \n\n\n\n70\n\nobserved. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as \nshown in table 30.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal insufficiency\nIn phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran \netexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL \nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency.\n\nIn a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the \nexposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately \n2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and \n4.4).\n\nTable 30: Half-life of total dabigatran in healthy subjects and subjects with impaired renal \nfunction.\n\nglomerular filtration rate \n(CrCL,)\n\n[mL/min]\n\ngMean (gCV %; range) \nhalf-life \n\n[h] \n?80 13.4 (25.7 %; 11.0-21.6)\n\n?50-<80 15.3 (42.7 %;11.7-34.1) \n\n?30-<50 18.4 (18.5 %;13.3-23.0) \n<30 27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0)\n\nAdditionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label \nrandomised pharmacokinetic study in NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (defined as \ncreatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 75 mg twice daily.\nThis regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9 %), \nmeasured immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak \nconcentration of 202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6 %) measured two hours after the administration of the last \ndose.\n\nClearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 adult patients with end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow \nrate, four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted \nin a removal of 50% to 60% of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance\ncleared by dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The \nanticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD \nrelationship was not affected by the procedure.\n\nThe median CrCL in RE-LY was 68.4 mL/min. Almost half (45.8%) of the RE-LY patients had a \nCrCL >50-<80 mL/min. Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min) \nhad on average 2.29-fold and 1.81-fold higher pre- and post-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations, \nrespectively, when compared with patients without renal impairment (CrCL ? 80 mL/min).\n\nThe median CrCL in the RE-COVER study was 100.4 mL/min. 21.7% of patients had mild renal \nimpairment (CrCL >50 - <80 mL/min) and 4.5% of patients had a moderate renal impairment (CrCL \nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min). Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment had at steady state an \naverage 1.8-fold and 3.6-fold higher pre-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations compared with \npatients with CrCL >80 mL/min, respectively. Similar values for CrCL were found in RE-COVER II.\n\nThe median CrCL in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies were 99.0 mL/min and 99.7 mL/min, \nrespectively. 22.9% and 22.5% of the patients had a CrCL >50-<80 mL/min, and 4.1% and 4.8% had \na CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies.\n\n\n\n71\n\nElderly patients\nSpecific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60% in the \nAUC and of more than 25% in Cmax compared to young subjects.\nThe effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31% \nhigher trough concentration for subjects ?75 years and by about 22% lower trough level for subjects \n<65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency \n(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBody weight\nThe dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20% lower in adult patients with a body weight \n>100 kg compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8%) of the subjects were in the ?50 kg and \n<100 kg category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in \nadult patients <50 kg are available.\n\nGender\nActive substance exposure in the primary VTE prevention studies was about 40% to 50% higher in \nfemale patients and no dose adjustment is recommended. In atrial fibrillation patients females had on \naverage 30% higher trough and post-dose concentrations. No dose adjustment is required (see section \n4.2).\n\nEthnic origin\nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic,\nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics.\n\nPaediatric population\nOral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted \nin exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT/PE. Based on the pooled analysis of \npharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1160.108, the observed geometric mean trough \nexposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to <2-year-old, 2 to <12-year-old and 12 \nto <18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nIn vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of \ncytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not \nshow any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin \n(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nEffects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \neffect of dabigatran.\n\nAn effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in \npre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were \ntoxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body \nweight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the \npre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the \ndams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\n\n\n72\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding \nevents at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile \nrats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in \nassociation with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile \ntoxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to \njuvenile animals.\n\nIn lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of \ndabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.\n\nDabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); age\n?75 years; heart failure (NYHA Class ?II); diabetes mellitus; hypertension.\n\nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults\n\nTreatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years of age.\n\nFor age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPradaxa capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or older who are able to \nswallow the capsules whole. Pradaxa coated granules can be used in children aged less than 12 years\nas soon as the child is able to swallow soft food. Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution should \nonly be used in children aged less than 1 year.\n\nWhen changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated \nin the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed for the age and weight of the child.\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk \nfactors (SPAF)\nTreatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE)\n\nThe recommended doses of dabigatran etexilate in the indications SPAF, DVT and PE are shown in \ntable 1.\n\n\n\n76\n\nTable 1: Dose recommendations for SPAF, DVT and PE \n\nDose recommendation\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism \nin adult patients with NVAF with one or \nmore risk factors (SPAF)\n\n300 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 150 mg \ncapsule twice daily\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE and prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE)\n\n300 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 150 mg \ncapsule twice daily following treatment with a \nparenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days\n\nDose reduction recommended\n\nPatients aged ?80 years\ndaily dose of 220 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one \n110 mg capsule twice daily Patients who receive concomitant verapamil\n\nDose reduction for consideration\n\nPatients between 75-80 years\n\ndaily dose of dabigatran etexilate of 300 mg or 220 mg \nshould be selected based on an individual assessment \nof the thromboembolic risk and the risk of bleeding \n\nPatients with moderate renal impairment \n(CrCL 30-50 mL/min)\n\nPatients with gastritis, esophagitis or \ngastroesophageal reflux\n\nOther patients at increased risk of bleeding\n\nFor DVT/PE the recommendation for the use of 220 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 110 mg \ncapsule twice daily is based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses and has not been \nstudied in this clinical setting. See further down and sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nIn case of intolerability to dabigatran etexilate, patients should be instructed to immediately consult \ntheir treating physician in order to be switched to alternate acceptable treatment options for prevention \nof stroke and systemic embolism associated with atrial fibrillation or for DVT/PE.\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment\n\nIn all patients and especially in the elderly (>75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this \nage group:\n? Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to \n\ninitiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment \n(i.e. CrCL <30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n? Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during \ntreatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal \nproducts).\n\nAdditional requirements in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and in patients aged over \n75 years:\n? Renal function should be assessed during treatment with dabigatran etexilate at least once a year \n\nor more frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal \nfunction could decline or deteriorate (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of \nconcomitant use of certain medicinal products).\n\nThe method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method. \n\n\n\n77\n\nDuration of use\n\nThe duration of use of dabigatran etexilate in the indications SPAF, DVT and PE are shown in table 2.\n\nTable 2: Duration of use for SPAF and DVT/PE\n\nIndication Duration of use\n\nSPAF Therapy should be continued long term.\n\nDVT/PE The duration of therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).\n\nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk factors \n(e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation) and longer durations should be based on \npermanent risk factors or idiopathic DVT or PE.\n\nMissed dose \n\nA forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. \nFrom 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose on, the missed dose should be omitted.\n\nNo double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be \ninstructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as \ndyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started\n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nThe starting time of the VKA should be adjusted based on CrCL as follows:\n? CrCL ?50 mL/min, VKA should be started 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate\n? CrCL ?30-<50 mL/min, VKA should be started 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate\n\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the International Normalised Ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nCardioversion (SPAF)\n\nPatients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted.\n\n\n\n78\n\nCatheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (SPAF)\n\nCatheter ablation can be conducted in patients on 150 mg twice daily dabigatran etexilate treatment. \nDabigatran etexilate treatment does not need to be interrupted (see section 5.1).\n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting (SPAF)\n\nPatients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo a PCI with stenting can be treated with \ndabigatran etexilate in combination with antiplatelets after haemostasis is achieved (see section 5.1).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nFor dose modifications in this population see table 1 above.\n\nPatients at risk of bleeding\n\nPatients with an increased bleeding risk (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2) should be closely \nmonitored clinically (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia). Dose adjustment should be decided at \nthe discretion of the physician, following assessment of the potential benefit and risk to an individual \npatient (see table 1 above). A coagulation test (see section 4.4) may help to identify patients with an \nincreased bleeding risk caused by excessive dabigatran exposure. When excessive dabigatran exposure \nis identified in patients at high risk of bleeding, a reduced dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule \ntwice daily is recommended. When clinically relevant bleeding occurs, treatment should be \ninterrupted.\n\nFor subjects with gastritis, esophagitis, or gastroesophageal reflux, a dose reduction may be considered \ndue to the elevated risk of major gastro-intestinal bleeding (see table 1 above and section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCL 50- ?80 mL/min). For \npatients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) the recommended dose of dabigatran \netexilate is also 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. However, for patients with high risk \nof bleeding, a dose reduction of dabigatran etexilate to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice \ndaily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in \npatients with renal impairment.\n\nConcomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. \namiodarone, quinidine or verapamil\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of amiodarone or quinidine (see sections 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.2).\n\nDose reductions are recommended for patients who receive concomitantly verapamil (see table 1 \nabove and sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation dabigatran etexilate and verapamil should be taken at \nthe same time.\n\nWeight\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended in \npatients with a body weight <50 kg (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n79\n\nGender\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of\nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF.\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients\n\nFor the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with \na parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be \ninitiated following previous treatment.\n\nDabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the \nevening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 12 hours \nas possible.\n\nThe recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules is based on the patient’s age and weight as \nshown in table 3. The table provides the single doses which are to be administered twice daily. The \ndose should be adjusted according to age and weight as treatment progresses.\n\nTable 3: Single dabigatran etexilate dose in milligrams (mg) by weight in kilograms (kg) and \nage in years of the patient to be administered twice daily\n\nAge in years\n8 to <9 9 to \n\n<10\n10 to \n<11\n\n11 to \n<12\n\n12 to \n<13\n\n13 to \n<14\n\n14 to \n<15\n\n15 to \n<16\n\n16 to \n<17\n\n17 to \n<18\n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nt \n\n[k\ng]\n\n>81 300 mg\nas two 150 mg capsules\n\nor\nfour 75 mg capsules\n\n71 to <81\n\n61 to <71\n\n51 to <61\n\n260 mg\nas one 110 mg plus one 150 mg capsule\n\nor\none 110 mg plus two 75 mg capsules\n\n41 to <51\n220 mg\n\nas two 110 mg capsules\n\n31 to <41\n185 mg\n\nas one 75 mg plus one 110 mg capsule\n\n26 to <31\n150 mg\n\nas one 150 mg capsule\nor\n\ntwo 75 mg capsules21 to <26\n\n16 to <21\nOne 110 mg capsule\n\n13 to <16\n\n11 to <13\nOne \n75 mg\ncapsule\n\nMeans that no dosing recommendation can be provided.\n\n\n\n80\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during treatment\n\nPrior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated \nusing the Schwartz formula.\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with an eGFR ?50 mL/min/1.73m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 3.\n\nWhile on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected \nthat the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain \nco-medications, etc).\n\nDuration of use\n\nThe duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment.\n\nMissed dose\n\nA forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. \nFrom 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. \nA double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients or their \ncaregivers should be instructed to contact the treating physician if the patient develops gastrointestinal \nsymptoms such as dyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nPatients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate.\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the International Normalised Ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis medicinal product is for oral use.\nThe capsules can be taken with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed as a whole with a \nglass of water, to facilitate delivery to the stomach.\n\n\n\n81\n\nPatients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see \nsections 5.2 and 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n? Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n? Severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) in adult patients\n? eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 in paediatric patients\n? Active clinically significant bleeding\n? Lesion or condition, if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities\n\n? Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), \noral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under specific circumstances. \nThese are switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is given at doses \nnecessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during \ncatheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.5)\n\n? Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival\n? Concomitant treatment with the following strong P-gp inhibitors: systemic ketoconazole, \n\ncyclosporine, itraconazole, dronedarone and the fixed-dose combination \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir (see section 4.5)\n\n? Prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment (see section 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaemorrhagic risk\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or\nwith concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet \naggregation. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or \nhaematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.\n\nFor adult patients in situations of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the \nanticoagulation effect of dabigatran is required, the specific reversal agent idarucizumab is available. \nThe efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. \nHaemodialysis can remove dabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, \ncoagulation factor concentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet \nconcentrates are other possible options (see also section 4.9).\n\nIn clinical trials, dabigatran etexilate was associated with higher rates of major gastrointestinal (GI) \nbleeding. An increased risk was seen in the elderly (?75 years) for the 150 mg twice daily dose \nregimen. Further risk factors (see also table 4) comprise co-medication with platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs\n(NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux.\n\n\n\n82\n\nRisk factors\n\nTable 4 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nTable 4: Factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nRisk factor\nPharmacodynamic and kinetic factors Age ?75 years\nFactors increasing dabigatran plasma levels Major:\n\n? Moderate renal impairment in adult \npatients (30-50 mL/min CrCL)\n\n? Strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.3 and \n4.5)\n\n? Mild to moderate P-gp inhibitor \nco-medication (e.g. amiodarone, verapamil, \nquinidine and ticagrelor; see section 4.5)\n\nMinor:\n? Low body weight (<50 kg) in adult patients\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions (see section 4.5) ? ASA and other platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel\n\n? NSAIDs\n? SSRIs or SNRIs\n? Other medicinal products which may \n\nimpair haemostasis\nDiseases / procedures with special \nhaemorrhagic risks\n\n? Congenital or acquired coagulation \ndisorders\n\n? Thrombocytopenia or functional platelet \ndefects\n\n? Recent biopsy, major trauma\n? Bacterial endocarditis\n? Esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal \n\nreflux\n\nLimited data is available in adult patients <50 kg (see section 5.2). \n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric \npatients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5).\n\nPrecautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk\n\nFor the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9.\n\nBenefit-risk assessment \n\nThe presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, \nantiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major\nbleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the \nbenefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nLimited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with \nactive meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran \netexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\n\n\n83\n\nClose clinical surveillance\n\nClose observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, \nespecially if risk factors are combined (see table 4 above). Particular caution should be exercised when \ndabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp \ninhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.5).\nClose observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nNSAIDs (see section 4.5).\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nPatients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate (see also section 4.3).\n\nWhen severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated and \nuse of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) may be considered in adult patients. The efficacy and \nsafety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove \ndabigatran.\n\nUse of proton-pump inhibitors\n\nThe administration of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. In case \nof paediatric patients local labeling recommendations for proton pump inhibitors have to be followed.\n\nLaboratory coagulation parameters\n\nAlthough this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the \nmeasurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to \ndabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors.\nDiluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test \nvariability (see section 5.1).\nThe international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false \npositive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore, INR tests should not be performed.\n\nTable 5 shows coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an \nincreased risk of bleeding. Respective thresholds for paediatric patients are not known (see section \n5.1).\n\nTable 5: Coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with \nan increased risk of bleeding.\n\nTest (trough value) Indication\nSPAF and DVT/PE\n\ndTT [ng/mL] >200\nECT [x-fold upper limit of normal] >3\naPTT [x-fold upper limit of normal] >2\nINR Should not be performed\n\nUse of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke\n\nThe use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be \nconsidered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal \n(ULN) according to the local reference range.\n\n\n\n84\n\nSurgery and interventions\n\nPatients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for \nbleeding. Therefore surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran\netexilate.\n\nPatients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. Dabigatran etexilate treatment \n(150 mg twice daily) does not need to be interrupted in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial \nfibrillation (see section 4.2).\n\nCaution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and \nanticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency \nmay take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such \ncases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still \nimpaired.\n\nEmergency surgery or urgent procedures\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. When rapid reversal of the anticoagulation \neffect is required the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran is available for adult \npatients. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. \nHaemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nReversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. \nDabigatran etexilate treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if the \npatient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved.\n\nSubacute surgery/interventions\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery / intervention should be delayed if \npossible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding \nmay be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention.\n\nElective surgery\n\nIf possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical \nprocedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may \nbe required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery.\n\nTable 6 summarises discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients.\n\nTable 6: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients\n\nRenal function\n(CrCL in \nmL/min)\n\nEstimated half-life \n(hours)\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be stopped before elective \nsurgery\n\nHigh risk of bleeding or \nmajor surgery\n\nStandard risk\n\n?80 ~ 13 2 days before 24 hours before\n?50-<80 ~ 15 2-3 days before 1-2 days before\n?30-<50 ~ 18 4 days before 2-3 days before (>48 hours)\n\n\n\n85\n\nDiscontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients are summarised in \ntable 7.\n\nTable 7: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients\n\nRenal function\n(eGFR in mL/min/1.73m2)\n\nStop dabigatran before elective surgery\n\n>80 24 hours before\n50 – 80 2 days before\n<50 These patients have not been studied (see section 4.3).\n\nSpinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture\n\nProcedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function.\n\nThe risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture \nand by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least \n2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients \nrequire frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma.\n\nPostoperative phase\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should be resumed / startedafter the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has \nbeen established. \n\nPatients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with reduced renal \nfunction (see also table 4), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nPatients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events\n\nThere are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and \ntherefore they should be treated with caution.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes >2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment \nexperience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate \nis not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any \nimpact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nInteraction with P-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma \nconcentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for \npatients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular \nfor patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 2-\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.\n\n\n\n86\n\nMyocardial Infarction (MI) \n\nIn the phase III study RE-LY (SPAF, see section 5.1) the overall rate of MI was 0.82, 0.81, and \n0.64% / year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily and \nwarfarin, respectively, an increase in relative risk for dabigatran of 29% and 27% compared to \nwarfarin. Irrespective of therapy, the highest absolute risk of MI was seen in the following subgroups, \nwith similar relative risk: patients with previous MI, patients ?65 years with either diabetes or \ncoronary artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and patients with \nmoderate renal dysfunction. Furthermore a higher risk of MI was seen in patients concomitantly taking \nASA plus clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone.\n\nIn the three active controlled DVT/PE phase III studies, a higher rate of MI was reported in patients \nwho received dabigatran etexilate than in those who received warfarin: 0.4% vs. 0.2% in the short-\nterm RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies; and 0.8% vs. 0.1% in the long-term RE-MEDY trial. \nThe increase was statistically significant in this study (p=0.022).\n\nIn the RE-SONATE study, which compared dabigatran etexilate to placebo, the rate of MI was 0.1% \nfor patients who received dabigatran etexilate and 0.2% for patients who received placebo\n\nActive cancer patients (DVT/PE, paediatric VTE)\n\nThe efficacy and safety have not been established for DVT/PE patients with active cancer. There is \nlimited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nFor some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption \nmay be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTransporter interactions\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp \ninhibitors (see table 8) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.\n\nIf not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or \nanaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. Dose reductions \nmay be required in combination with some P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nTable 8: Transporter interactions\n\nP-gp inhibitors\n\nConcomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\nKetoconazole Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values by 2.38-fold and \n2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold and \n2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once \ndaily. \n\nDronedarone When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total \ndabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, \nrespectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone bid, and about 2.1-fold \nand 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg.\n\nItraconazole, Based on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. \n\n\n\n87\n\ncyclosporine\nGlecaprevir /\npibrentasvir\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of the \nP-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase exposure of \ndabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nTacrolimus Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-\ngp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate has not been \nclinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited clinical data with \nanother P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the inhibition of P-gp with \ntacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong P-gp inhibitors. \n\nCautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) \n\nVerapamil When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the \nCmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this change \ndiffers depending on timing of administration and formulation of verapamil (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nThe greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an \nimmediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to the \ndabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC by about \n2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration of an \nextended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and AUC by about \n1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increase of Cmax by \nabout 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold).\n\nThere was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours \nafter dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC by about \n1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 2 hours.\n\nAmiodarone When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg\namiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active \nmetabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were \nincreased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the long half-life \nof amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks after \ndiscontinuation of amiodarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nQuinidine Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1,000 mg. \nDabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day \neither with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on \naverage by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with concomitant quinidine (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nClarithromycin When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with \ndabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold and \nCmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. \n\nTicagrelor When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered \nsimultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC and \nCmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After multiple doses \nof ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. the increase of dabigatran exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-\nfold for Cmax and AUC, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss by \n1.49-fold  and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\nwas reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran \n\n\n\n88\n\netexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended administration for \nstart of ticagrelor with a loading dose.\n\nConcomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor b.i.d. (maintenance dose) with \n110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\n1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone.\n\nPosaconazole Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. \nCaution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with \nposaconazole.\n\nP-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant use should be avoided.\n\ne.g. rifampicin, \nSt. John´s wort \n(Hypericum \nperforatum), \ncarbamazepine, \nor phenytoin\n\nConcomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran \nconcentrations.\n\nPre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for \n7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5% and 67%, \nrespectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure \nclose to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No further \nincrease in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.\n\nProtease inhibitors such as ritonavir\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\ne.g. ritonavir \nand its \ncombinations \nwith other \nprotease \ninhibitors\n\nThese affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and \nare therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran etexilate.\n\nP-gp substrate\n\nDigoxin In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was \nco-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant \nchanges on dabigatran exposure have been observed.\n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nThere is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of \nbleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated \nheparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, \ndesirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral \nanticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa \nreceptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4).\n\nFrom the data collected in the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1) it was observed that the \nconcomitant use of other oral or parenteral anticoagulants increases major bleeding rates with both \ndabigatran etexilate and warfarin by approximately 2.5-fold, mainly related to situations when \nswitching from one anticoagulant to another (see section 4.3). Furthermore, concomitant use of \n\n\n\n89\n\nantiplatelets, ASA or clopidogrel approximately doubled major bleeding rates with both dabigatran\netexilate and warfarin (see section 4.4).\n\nUFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3).\n\nTable 9: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with \nincreased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With \nchronic use in the RE-LY study, NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by \napproximately 50% on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. \n\nClopidogrel In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran \netexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times \ncompared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss and \nthe coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation \nas measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined \ntreatment and the respective mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or \n600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40% (see \nsection 4.4) .\n\nASA Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the \nrisk for any bleeding from 12% to 18% and 24% with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nLMWH The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not \nbeen specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily \n40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to \ndabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of dabigatran etexilate \n(single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity was observed after \ndabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that after \ntreatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over \neffect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran \nrelated anti-coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of \nenoxaparin.\n\nOther interactions\n\nTable 10: Other interactions\n\nSelective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake \ninhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nSSRIs, SNRIs SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups,\n\nSubstances influencing gastric pH\n\nPantoprazole When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran \nAUC of approximately 30% was observed. Pantoprazole and other proton-pump \ninhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and concomitant \nPPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa.\n\nRanitidine Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran.\n\n\n\n90\n\nInteractions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no \nin vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions \nare not expected with dabigatran.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women.\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown.\n\nPradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding.\nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data available.\n\nIn animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations \nand an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure \nlevel compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence \non male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5- to 10-fold higher plasma \nexposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an \nincrease in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre- and post-natal study, an \nincrease in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to \na plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64,000 patients; \nthereof approximately 35,000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate.\nIn total, 22% of patients with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism (long-term treatment for up to 3 years), 14% of patients treated for DVT/PE and 15% of \npatients treated for DVT/PE prevention experienced adverse reactions.\n\n\n\n91\n\nThe most commonly reported events are bleedings occurring in approximately 16.6% in patients with \natrial fibrillation treated long-term for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism and in 14.4% of \nadult patients treated for DVT/PE. Furthermore, bleeding occurred in 19.4% of patients in the \nDVT/PE prevention trial RE-MEDY (adult patients) and in 10.5% of patients in the DVT/PE \nprevention trial RE-SONATE (adult patients). \n\nSince the patient populations treated in the three indications are not comparable and bleeding events \nare distributed over several System Organ Classes (SOC), a summary description of major and any \nbleeding are broken down by indication and are provided in tables 12-15 below. \n\nAlthough low in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of \nlocation, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 11 shows the adverse reactions identified studies and post-marketing data in the indications \nprevention of thromboembolic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, \nDVT/PE treatment and DVT/PE prevention.

The signs, symptoms, and severity \n(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding \nand/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were \nseen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. \nThus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of \nvalue to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. \nthose patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis\nor strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may \npresent as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and \nunexplained shock.\n\nKnown bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to \nhypoperfusion have been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. For adult patients, a specific \n\n\n\n93\n\nreversal agent for dabigatran, idarucizumab, is available in case of uncontrollable bleeding (see \nSection 4.9).\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors (SPAF)\n\nThe table 12 shows bleeding events broken down to major and any bleeding in the pivotal study \ntesting the prevention of thromboembolic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial \nfibrillation.\n\nTable 12: Bleeding events in a study testing the prevention of thromboembolic stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin \n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022\nMajor bleeding 347 (2.92 %) 409 (3.40 %) 426 (3.61 %)\n\nIntracranial bleeding 27 (0.23 %) 39 (0.32 %) 91 (0.77 %)\nGI bleeding 134 (1.13 %) 192 (1.60 %) 128 (1.09 %)\nFatal bleeding 26 (0.22 %) 30 (0.25 %) 42 (0.36 %)\n\nMinor bleeding 1,566 (13.16 %) 1,787 (14.85 %) 1,931 (16.37 %)\nAny bleeding 1,759 (14.78 %) 1,997 (16.60 %) 2,169 (18.39 %)\n\nSubjects randomised to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily had a \nsignificantly lower risk for life-threatening bleeds and intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [p \n<0.05]. Both dose strengths of dabigatran etexilate had also a statistically significant lower total bleed \nrate. Subjects randomised to 110 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly lower risk for \nmajor bleeds compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.81 [p=0.0027]). Subjects randomised to 150 mg \ndabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly higher risk for major GI bleeds compared with \nwarfarin (hazard ratio 1.48 [p=0.0005]. This effect was seen primarily in patients ?75 years.\nThe clinical benefit of dabigatran with regard to stroke and systemic embolism prevention and \ndecreased risk of ICH compared to warfarin is preserved across individual subgroups, e.g. renal \nimpairment, age, concomitant medicinal product use such as anti-platelets or P-gp inhibitors. While \ncertain patient subgroups are at an increased risk of major bleeding when treated with an \nanticoagulant, the excess bleeding risk for dabigatran is due to GI bleeding, typically seen within the \nfirst 3-6 months following initiation of dabigatran etexilate therapy.\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment)\n\nTable 13 shows bleeding events in the pooled pivotal studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II testing \nthe treatment of DVT and PE. In the pooled studies the primary safety endpoints of major bleeding, \nmajor or clinically relevant bleeding and any bleeding were significantly lower than warfarin at a \nnominal alpha level of 5%. \n\n\n\n94\n\nTable 13: Bleeding events in the studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II testing the treatment \nof DVT and PE\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin Hazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin\n\n(95% confidence \ninterval)\n\nPatients included in safety \nanalysis \n\n2,456 2,462 \n\nMajor bleeding events 24 (1.0 %) 40 (1.6 %) 0.60 (0.36, 0.99)\n           Intracranial\n           Bleeding\n\n2 (0.1 %) 4 (0.2 %) 0.50 (0.09, 2.74)\n\n           Major GI bleeding 10 (0.4 %) 12 (0.5 %) 0.83 (0.36, 1.93)\n           Life-threatening\n           bleed\n\n4 (0.2 %) 6 (0.2 %) 0.66 (0.19, 2.36)\n\nMajor bleeding \nevents/clinically relevant \nbleeds \n\n109 (4.4 %) 189 (7.7 %) 0.56 (0.45, 0.71)\n\nAny bleeding 354 (14.4 %) 503 (20.4 %) 0.67 (0.59, 0.77)\n          Any GI bleeding 70 (2.9 %) 55 (2.2 %) 1.27 (0.90, 1.82)\n\nBleeding events for both treatments are counted from the first intake of dabigatran etexilate or \nwarfarin after the parenteral therapy has been discontinued (oral only treatment period).

Because adverse reactions are reported in the postmarketing surveillance setting \nfrom a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably determine their frequency. The \nreporting rate was estimated as 7 events per 1 million patient years for agranulocytosis and as 5 events \nper 1 million patient years for neutropenia.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients was studied in two phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1160.108). In total,\n328 paediatric patients had been treated with dabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and \nweight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate.\n\nOverall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults.\n\nIn total, 26% of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of \nrecurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 16 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and \nprevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients.

The \nfrequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to <18 years: 28.6%) than \nin the younger age groups (birth to <2 years: 23.3%; 2 to <12 years: 16.2%). Major or severe bleeding, \nregardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of \nbleeding.\n\nIn case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the \ntime by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional \nmeasures e.g. dialysis have been initiated.\n\nExcessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran \nis excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding \nis low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this \napproach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).\n\nManagement of bleeding complications\n\nIn the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and \nthe source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive \ntreatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the \nprescriber’s discretion.\n\nFor adult patients in situations when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is required\nthe specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran is \navailable. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nCoagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken \ninto account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in \nreversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and \nalso on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become \nunreliable following administration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be \nexercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of \nplatelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal \nproducts have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's \njudgement.\n\nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n98\n\nmajor bleedings.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. \nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible \ndirect thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma.\nSince thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the \ncoagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free \nthrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant \nactivity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral \nadministration in various animal models of thrombosis.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant \neffect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT.\n\nThe calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma \nconcentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the \ncalibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of \nquantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered.\n\nThe ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nThe aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation \nintensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable \nfor precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of \ndabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value \nindicates that the patient is anticoagulated. \n\nIn general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran \nlevels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile \nof dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough (for aPTT \nthresholds see section 4.4, table 5) is considered to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors \n(SPAF)\n\nSteady state geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 2 hours after \n150 mg dabigatran etexilate administration twice daily, was 175 ng/mL, with a range of \n117-275 ng/mL (25th–75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, \nmeasured at trough in the morning, at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg \ndabigatran evening dose), was on average 91.0 ng/mL, with a range of 61.0-143 ng/mL (25th–\n75th percentile range).\n\n\n\n99\n\nFor patients with NVAF treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism with 150 mg \ndabigatran etexilate twice daily,\n? the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after \n\nthe previous dose) was about 200 ng/mL,\n? an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 3-fold upper \n\nlimit of normal refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 103 seconds,\n? an aPTT ratio greater than 2-fold upper limit of normal (aPTT prolongation of about \n\n80 seconds), at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) reflects the 90th percentile of \nobservations.\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE)\n\nIn patients treated for DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily, the dabigatran \ngeometric mean trough concentration, measured within 10?16 hours after dose, at the end of the \ndosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran evening dose), was 59.7 ng/ml, with a range \nof 38.6 - 94.5 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range). For treatment of DVT and PE, with dabigatran \netexilate 150 mg twice daily,\n? the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after \n\nthe previous dose) was about 146 ng/ml,\n? an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 2.3-fold \n\ncompared to baseline refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 74 seconds,\n? the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) was 62 seconds, \n\nwhich would be 1.8-fold compared to baseline.\n\nIn patients treated for prevention of recurrent of DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice \ndaily no pharmacokinetic data are available. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nEthnic origin\n\nNo clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or \nChinese patients were observed.\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors\n\nThe clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate is derived from the RE-LY study \n(Randomised Evaluation of Long –term anticoagulant therapy) a multi-centre, multi-national, \nrandomised parallel group study of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110 mg and 150 mg \ntwice daily) compared to open-label warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk \nof stroke and systemic embolism. The primary objective in this study was to determine if dabigatran \netexilate was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint stroke and \nsystemic embolism. Statistical superiority was also analysed.\n\nIn the RE-LY study, a total of 18,113 patients were randomised, with a mean age of 71.5 years and a \nmean CHADS2 score of 2.1. The patient population was 64% male, 70 % Caucasian and 16% Asian. \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR)\n(INR 2-3) was 64.4% (median TTR 67%).\n\nThe RE-LY study demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, at a dose of 110 mg twice daily, is \nnon-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in subjects with atrial \nfibrillation, with a reduced risk of ICH, total bleeding and major bleeding. The dose of 150 mg twice \ndaily, reduces significantly the risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, ICH and \ntotal bleeding compared to warfarin. Major bleeding rates with this dose were comparable to warfarin.\nMyocardial infarction rates were slightly increased with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily and \n150 mg twice daily compared to warfarin (hazard ratio 1.29; p=0.0929 and hazard ratio 1.27; \n\n\n\n100\n\np=0.1240, respectively). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of dabigatran \netexilate compared to warfarin diminish.\n\nTables 17-19 display details of key results in the overall population:\n\nTable 17: Analysis of first occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism (primary endpoint) \nduring the study period in RE-LY.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin \n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022\nStroke and/or systemic \n\nembolism\nIncidences (%) 183 (1.54) 135 (1.12) 203 (1.72)\nHazard ratio over \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.89 (0.73, 1.09) 0.65 (0.52, 0.81)\n\np value superiority p=0.2721 p=0.0001\n% refers to yearly event rate\n\nTable 18: Analysis of first occurrence of ischemic or haemorrhagic strokes during the study \nperiod in RE-LY.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin \n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022\nStroke\n\nIncidences (%) 171 (1.44) 123 (1.02) 187 (1.59)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.91 (0.74, 1.12) 0.64 (0.51, 0.81)\n\n          p-value 0.3553 0.0001\nSystemic embolism\n\nIncidences (%) 15 (0.13) 13 (0.11) 21 (0.18)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.71 (0.37, 1.38) 0.61 (0.30, 1.21)\n\n          p-value 0.3099 0.1582\nIschemic stroke\n\nIncidences (%) 152 (1.28) 104 (0.86) 134 (1.14)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI) \n\n1.13 (0.89, 1.42) 0.76 (0.59, 0.98)\n\n          p-value 0.3138 0.0351\nHaemorrhagic stroke\n\nIncidences (%) 14 (0.12) 12 (0.10) 45 (0.38)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.31 (0.17, 0.56) 0.26 (0.14, 0.49)\n\n          p-value 0.0001 <0.0001\n% refers to yearly event rate\n\n\n\n101\n\nTable 19: Analysis of all cause and cardiovascular survival during the study period in RE-LY.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin \n\nSubjects randomised 6,015 6,076 6,022 \nAll-cause mortality\n\nIncidences (%) 446 (3.75) 438 (3.64) 487 (4.13)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.91 (0.80, 1.03) 0.88 (0.77, 1.00)\n\np-value 0.1308 0.0517\nVascular mortality\n\nIncidences (%) 289 (2.43) 274 (2.28) 317 (2.69)\nHazard ratio vs. \nwarfarin (95 % CI)\n\n0.90 (0.77, 1.06) 0.85 (0.72, 0.99)\n\n          p-value 0.2081 0.0430\n% refers to yearly event rate\n\nTables 20-21 display results of the primary efficacy and safety endpoint in relevant sub-populations:\n\nFor the primary endpoint, stroke and systemic embolism, no subgroups (i.e., age, weight, gender, renal \nfunction, ethnicity, etc.) were identified with a different risk ratio compared to warfarin.\n\nTable 20: Hazard Ratio and 95 % CI for stroke/systemic embolism by subgroups\n\nEndpoint Dabigatran etexilate\n110 mg twice daily vs. warfarin\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily vs. warfarin\n\nAge (years)\n<65 1.10 (0.64, 1.87) 0.51 (0.26, 0.98)\n\n65? and <75 0.86 (0.62, 1.19) 0.67 (0.47, 0.95)\n?75 0.88 (0.66, 1.17) 0.68 (0.50, 0.92)\n?80 0.68 (0.44, 1.05) 0.67 (0.44, 1.02)\n\nCrCL(mL/min)\n30? and <50 0.89 (0.61, 1.31) 0.48 (0.31, 0.76)\n50? and <80 0.91 (0.68, 1.20) 0.65 (0.47, 0.88)\n\n?80 0.81 (0.51, 1.28) 0.69 (0.43, 1.12)\n\nFor the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding there was an interaction of treatment effect and age. \nThe relative risk of bleeding with dabigatran compared to warfarin increased with age.

Patients \nwere eligible for the RELY-ABLE trial if they had not permanently discontinued study medication at \nthe time of their final RE-LY study visit. Enrolled patients continued to receive the same double-blind \ndabigatran etexilate dose randomly allocated in RE-LY, for up to 43 months of follow up after RE-LY \n(total mean follow-up RE-LY + RELY-ABLE, 4.5 years). There were 5897 patients enrolled, \nrepresenting 49% of patients originally randomly assigned to receive dabigatran etexilate in RE-LY \nand 86% of RELY-ABLE–eligible patients. \nDuring the additional 2.5 years of treatment in RELY-ABLE, with a maximum exposure of over \n6 years (total exposure in RELY + RELY-ABLE), the long-term safety profile of dabigatran etexilate \nwas confirmed for both test doses 110 mg b.i.d. and 150 mg b.i.d.. No new safety findings were \nobserved.\nThe rates of outcome events including, major bleed and other bleeding events were consistent with \nthose seen in RE-LY.\n\nData from non-interventional studies\n\nA non-interventional study (GLORIA-AF) prospectively collected (in its second phase) safety and \neffectiveness data in newly diagnosed NVAF patients on dabigatran etexilate in a real-world setting. \nThe study included 4,859 patients on dabigatran etexilate (55% treated with 150 mg bid, 43% treated \nwith 110 mg bid, 2% treated with 75 mg bid). Patients were followed-up for 2 years. The mean \nCHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were 1.9 and 1.2, respectively. Mean on-therapy follow-up time was \n18.3 months. Major bleeding occurred in 0.97 per 100 patient-years. Life-threatening bleeding was \nreported in 0.46 per 100 patient-years, intracranial haemorrhage in 0.17 per 100 patient-years and \ngastrointestinal bleeding in 0.60 per 100 patient-years. Stroke occurred in 0.65 per 100 patient-years. \n\nIn addition, in a non-interventional study [Graham DJ et al., Circulation. 2015;131:157-164] in more \nthan 134,000 elderly patients with NVAF in the United States (contributing more than 37,500 patient-\nyears of on-therapy follow-up time) dabigatran etexilate (84% patients treated with 150 mg bid, 16% \npatients treated with 75 mg bid) was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio \n0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 – 0.96), intracranial haemorrhage (hazard ratio 0.34, CI 0.26 –\n0.46), and mortality (hazard ratio 0.86, CI 0.77 – 0.96) and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding \n\n(hazard ratio 1.28, CI 1.14 – 1.44) compared to warfarin. No difference was found for major bleeding \n(hazard ratio 0.97, CI 0.88 – 1.07).\n\nThese observations in real-world settings are consistent with the established safety and efficacy profile \nfor dabigatran etexilate in the RE-LY study in this indication.\n\n\n\n103\n\nPatients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation\n\nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicenter, exploratory study with blinded, centrally \nadjudicated endpoint evaluation (RE-CIRCUIT) was conducted in 704 patients who were under stable \nanticoagulant treatment. The study compared 150 mg twice daily uninterrupted dabigatran etexilate \nwith uninterrupted INR-adjusted warfarin in catheter ablation of paroxysmal or persistent atrial \nfibrillation. Of the 704 enrolled patients, 317 underwent atrial fibrillation ablation on uninterrupted \ndabigatran and 318 underwent atrial fibrillation ablation on uninterrupted warfarin. All patients \nunderwent a Trans-oesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) prior to catheter ablation. The primary \noutcome (adjudicated major bleeding according to ISTH criteria) occurred in 5 (1.6%) patients in the \ndabigatran etexilate group and 22 (6.9%) patients in the warfarin group (risk difference ?5.3%; 95% \nCI ?8.4, ?2.2; P=0.0009). There was no stroke/systemic embolism/TIA (composite) event in the \ndabigatran etexilate arm, and one event (TIA) in the warfarin arm from the time of ablation and until\n8 weeks post-ablation. This exploratory study showed that dabigatran etexilate was associated with a \nsignificant reduction in MBE rate compared with INR-adjusted warfarin in the setting of ablation.\n\nPatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting\n\nA prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study (Phase IIIb) to evaluate dual-\ntherapy with dabigatran etexilate (110 mg or 150 mg bid) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor (P2Y12 \nantagonist) vs. triple-therapy with warfarin (adjusted to a INR 2.0 – 3.0) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor \nand ASA was conducted in 2725 patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI \nwith stenting (RE-DUAL PCI). Patients were randomised to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg bid dual-\ntherapy, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg bid dual-therapy or warfarin triple-therapy. Elderly patients \noutside of the United States (?80 years of age for all countries, ?70 years of age for Japan) were \nrandomly assigned to the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg dual-therapy group or the warfarin triple-therapy \ngroup. The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint of major bleeds based on ISTH definition or \nclinically relevant non-major bleeding event.\n\nThe incidence of the primary endpoint was 15.4% (151 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg \ndual-therapy group as compared with 26.9% (264 patients) in the warfarin triple-therapy group (HR \n0.52; 95% CI 0.42, 0.63; P<0.0001 for non-inferiority and P<0.0001 for superiority) and 20.2% \n(154 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 25.7% \n(196 patients) in the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58, 0.88; \nP<0.0001 for non-inferiority and P=0.002 for superiority). As part of the descriptive analysis, TIMI \n(Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding events was lower in both dabigatran etexilate \ndual-therapy groups than in the warfarin triple-therapy group: 14 events (1.4%) in the dabigatran \netexilate 110 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 37 events (3.8%) in the warfarin triple-therapy \ngroup (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20, 0.68; P=0.002) and 16 events (2.1%) in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg \ndual-therapy group as compared with 30 events (3.9%) in the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy \ngroup (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.28, 0.93; P=0.03). Both dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy groups had lower \nrates of intracranial hemorrhage than the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group: 3 events (0.3%) \nin the 110 mg dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 10 events (1.0%) in the \nwarfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.08, 1.07; P=0.06) and 1 event (0.1%) in the 150 mg \ndabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 8 events (1.0%) in the corresponding \nwarfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.12; 95% CI 0.02, 0.98; P=0.047). The incidence of the composite \nefficacy endpoint of death, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic \nembolism) or unplanned revascularization in the two dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy groups \ncombined was non-inferior to the warfarin triple-therapy group (13.7% vs. 13.4% respectively; HR \n1.04; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.29; P=0.0047 for non-inferiority).There were no statistical differences in the \nindividual components of the efficacy endpoints between either dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy \ngroups and warfarin triple-therapy.\n\nThis study demonstrated that dual-therapy with dabigatran etexilate and a P2Y12 antagonist \nsignificantly reduced the risk of bleeding vs. warfarin triple-therapy with non-inferiority for composite \nof thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stenting.\n\n\n\n104\n\nTreatment of DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment)\n\nThe efficacy and safety was investigated in two multi-center, randomised, double blind, parallel-\ngroup, replicate studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II. These studies compared dabigatran etexilate \n(150 mg bid) with warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) in patients with acute DVT and/or PE. The primary \nobjective of these studies was to determine if dabigatran etexilate was non-inferior to warfarin in \nreducing the occurrence of the primary endpoint which was the composite of recurrent symptomatic \nDVT and/or PE and related deaths within the 6 month treatment period. \n\nIn the pooled RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies, a total of 5,153 patients were randomised and \n5,107 were treated.\n\nThe duration of treatment with fixed dose of dabigatran was 174.0 days without coagulation \nmonitoring. For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0 to 3.0) \nwas 60.6%. \n\nThe trials, demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior \nto the treatment with warfarin (non-inferiority margin for RE-COVER and RE-COVER II: 3.6 for risk \ndifference and 2.75 for hazard ratio).\n\nTable 22: Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (VTE is a composite of \nDVT and/or PE) until the end of post-treatment period for the pooled studies RE-\nCOVER and RE-COVER II\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily \n\nWarfarin\n\nTreated patients 2,553 2,554 \n\nRecurrent symptomatic \nVTE and VTE-related \ndeath\n\n68 ( 2.7 %) 62 ( 2.4 %)\n\nHazard ratio vs warfarin\n(95% confidence \ninterval)\n\n1.09\n(0.77, 1.54)\n\nSecondary efficacy \nendpoints\nRecurrent symptomatic \nVTE and all-cause \ndeaths\n\n109 (4.3 %) 104 (4.1 %)\n\n95 % confidence \ninterval \n\n3.52, 5.13 3.34, 4.91\n\nSymptomatic DVT 45 (1.8 %) 39 (1.5 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n1.29, 2.35 1.09, 2.08\n\nSymptomatic PE 27 (1.1 %) 26 (1.0 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n0.70, 1.54 0.67, 1.49\n\nVTE-related deaths 4 (0.2 %) 3 (0.1 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n0.04, 0.40 0.02, 0.34\n\nAll-cause deaths 51 (2.0 %) 52 (2.0 %)\n95 % confidence \ninterval\n\n1.49, 2.62 1.52, 2.66\n\n\n\n105\n\nPrevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE prevention)\n\nTwo randomised, parallel group, double-blind studies were performed in patients previously treated \nwith anticoagulation therapy. RE-MEDY, warfarin controlled study, enrolled patients already treated \nfor 3 to 12 months with the need for further anticoagulant treatment and RE-SONATE, the placebo \ncontrolled study, enrolled patients already treated for 6 to 18 months with Vitamin K inhibitors.\n\nThe objective of the RE-MEDY study was to compare the safety and efficacy of oral dabigatran \netexilate (150 mg bid) to warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) for the long-term treatment and prevention of \nrecurrent, symptomatic DVT and/or PE. A total of 2,866 patients were randomised and 2,856 patients \nwere treated. Duration of dabigatran etexilate treatment ranged from 6 to 36 months (median \n534.0 days). For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) \nwas 64.9%. \n\nRE-MEDY demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior \nto warfarin (non-inferiority margin: 2.85 for hazard ratio and 2.8 for risk difference).\n\nTable 23: Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (VTE is a composite of \nDVT and/or PE) until the end of post-treatment period for the RE-MEDY study\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nWarfarin\n\nTreated patients 1430 1426 \nRecurrent symptomatic VTE and VTE-\nrelated death\n\n26 (1.8 %) 18 (1.3 %)\n\nHazard ratio vs warfarin \n(95% confidence interval)\n\n1.44\n(0.78, 2.64)\n\nnon-inferiority margin 2.85\nPatients with event  at 18 months 22 17\nCumulative risk at \n18 months (%)\n\n1.7 1.4\n\nRisk difference vs. warfarin (%) 0.4\n\n95% confidence interval\nnon-inferiority margin 2.8\nSecondary efficacy endpoints\nRecurrent symptomatic VTE and all-\ncause deaths\n\n42 (2.9 %) 36 (2.5 %)\n\n95 % confidence interval 2.12, 3.95 1.77, 3.48\nSymptomatic DVT 17 (1.2 %) 13 (0.9 %)\n95 % confidence interval 0.69, 1.90 0.49, 1.55\nSymptomatic PE 10 (0.7 %) 5 (0.4 %)\n95 % confidence interval 0.34, 1.28 0.11, 0.82\nVTE-related deaths 1 (0.1 %) 1 (0.1 %)\n95 % confidence interval 0.00, 0.39 0.00, 0.39\nAll-cause deaths 17 (1.2 %) 19 (1.3 %)\n95 % confidence interval 0.69, 1.90 0.80, 2.07\n\nThe objective of the RE-SONATE study was to evaluate superiority of dabigatran etexilate versus \nplacebo for the prevention of recurrent symptomatic DVT and/or PE in patients who had already \ncompleted 6 to 18 months of treatment with VKA. The intended therapy was 6 months dabigatran \netexilate 150 mg twice daily without need for monitoring. \n\nRE-SONATE demonstrated dabigatran etexilate was superior to placebo for the prevention of \nrecurrent symptomatic DVT/PE events including unexplained deaths, with a risk reduction from 5.6% \nto 0.4% (relative risk reduction 92% based on hazard ratio) during the treatment period (p<0.0001). \n\n\n\n106\n\nAll secondary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints showed \nsuperiority of dabigatran etexilate over placebo.\n\nThe study included observational follow-up for 12 months after the conclusion of treatment. After \ndiscontinuation of study medication the effect was maintained until the end of the follow-up, \nindicating that the initial treatment effect of dabigatran etexilate was sustained. No rebound effect was \nobserved. At the end of the follow-up VTE events in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate was \n6.9% vs. 10.7% among the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.61 (95% CI 0.42, 0.88), p=0.0082).\n\nTable 24: Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (VTE is a composite of \nDVT and/or PE) until the end of post-treatment period for the RE-SONATE study.\n\nDabigatran etexilate\n150 mg twice daily\n\nPlacebo\n\nTreated patients 681 662 \nRecurrent symptomatic \nVTE and related deaths\n\n3 (0.4 %) 37 (5.6 %)\n\nHazard Ratio vs placebo \n(95% confidence \ninterval)\n\n0.08\n(0.02, 0.25)\n\np-value for superiority <0.0001\nSecondary efficacy  \nendpoints\nRecurrent symptomatic \nVTE and all-cause \ndeaths\n\n3 (0.4 %) 37 (5.6 %)\n\n95% confidence interval 0.09, 1.28 3.97, 7.62\nSymptomatic DVT 2 (0.3 %) 23 (3.5 %)\n95% confidence interval 0.04, 1.06 2.21, 5.17\nSymptomatic PE 1 (0.1 %) 14 (2.1 %)\n95% confidence interval 0.00, 0.82 1.16, 3.52\nVTE-related deaths 0 (0) 0 (0)\n95% confidence interval 0.00, 0.54 0.00, 0.56\nUnexplained deaths 0 (0) 2 (0.3 %)\n95% confidence interval 0.00, 0.54 0.04, 1.09\nAll-cause deaths 0 (0) 2 (0.3 %)\n95% confidence interval 0.00, 0.54 0.04, 1.09\n\nClinical trials for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves\n\nA phase II study examined dabigatran etexilate and warfarin in a total of 252 patients with recent \nmechanical valve replacement surgery (i.e. within the current hospital stay) and in patients who \nreceived a mechanical heart valve replacement more than three months ago. More thromboembolic \nevents (mainly strokes and symptomatic/asymptomatic prosthetic valve thrombosis) and more \nbleeding events were observed with dabigatran etexilate than with warfarin. In the early post-operative \npatients, major bleeding manifested predominantly as haemorrhagic pericardial effusions, specifically \nin patients who started dabigatran etexilate early (i.e. on Day 3) after heart valve replacement surgery \n(see section 4.3).\n\n\n\n107\n\nPaediatric population\n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPradaxa in all subsets of the paediatric population for the indication of prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with NVAF (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients\n\nThe DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate \ncompared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, non-\ninferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-\nappropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses \nadjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or \nvitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a \ncomposite endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and \nfreedom from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and \nintracranial abscess.\nIn total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran \netexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were \n12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than \n2 years. \nOf the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients \n(42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus \nresolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The \ncorresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent \nresults were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the \ntreatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the \n3 different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the \ndabigatran etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1%) and 7/13 (53.8%) for patients \nfrom birth to <2 years, 21/43 (48.8%) and 12/21 (57.1%) for patients aged 2 to <12 years, and 47/112 \n(42.0%) and 19/56 (33.9%) for patients aged 12 to <18 years.\nAdjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and \n2 patients (2.2%) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first \nmajor bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6%) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients \n(24.4%) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The \ncombined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major \n(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4%) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group \nand 3 (3.3%) patients in the SOC group.\n\nAn open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was \nconducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the \npresence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least \n3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. \nEligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, \ncoated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a \nmaximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major \nand minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic \nevents) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication \ncommittee.\nOverall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less \nthan 18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients \nin age stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients \n(1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. \n\n\n\n108\n\nAdjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients \n(22.5%) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients \n(1.4%), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For \n3 patients (1.4%), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months. \nNo on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) developed post-\nthrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, \nwhich is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. \nThe absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa was approximately \n6.5%.\nAfter oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran \nin plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 \nand 2.0 hours post administration.\n\nAbsorption\n\nA study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, \ndemonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth \nplasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma \nconcentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to \ncontributing factors such as anaesthesia, GI paresis, and surgical effects independent of the oral \nmedicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed \nabsorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran \nis rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration.\n\nFood does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma \nconcentrations by 2 hours.\n\nCmax and AUC were dose proportional.\n\nThe oral bioavailability may be increased by 75% after a single dose and 37% at steady state \ncompared to the reference capsule formulation when the pellets are taken without the \nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, the integrity of the HPMC capsules \nshould always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally increased bioavailability of \ndabigatran etexilate (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\n\nLow (34-35%) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was \nobserved. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60-70 L exceeded the volume of total body \nwater indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of \nradiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived \nradioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85%). Faecal excretion accounted for 6% of the\nadministered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94% of the administered dose \nby 168 hours post dose.\nDabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four \npositional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10% of total \ndabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical \n\n\n\n109\n\nmethods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of \napproximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate.\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of \n11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was \nobserved. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as \nshown in table 25.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal insufficiency\nIn phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran \netexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL \nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency.\n\nIn a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the \nexposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately \n2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and \n4.4).\n\nTable 25: Half-life of total dabigatran in healthy subjects and subjects with impaired renal \nfunction.\n\nglomerular filtration rate \n(CrCL,)\n\n[mL/min]\n\ngMean (gCV %; range) \nhalf-life \n\n[h] \n?80 13.4 (25.7 %; 11.0-21.6)\n\n?50-<80 15.3 (42.7 %;11.7-34.1) \n\n?30-<50 18.4 (18.5 %;13.3-23.0) \n<30 27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0)\n\nAdditionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label \nrandomised pharmacokinetic study in NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (defined as \ncreatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 75 mg twice daily.\nThis regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9%), \nmeasured immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak \nconcentration of 202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6%) measured two hours after the administration of the last \ndose.\n\nClearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 adult patients with end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow \nrate, four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted \nin a removal of 50% to 60% of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance\ncleared by dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The \nanticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD \nrelationship was not affected by the procedure.\n\nThe median CrCL in RE-LY was 68.4 mL/min. Almost half (45.8%) of the RE-LY patients had a \nCrCL >50-<80 mL/min. Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min) \nhad on average 2.29-fold and 1.81-fold higher pre- and post-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations, \nrespectively, when compared with patients without renal impairment (CrCL ?80 mL/min).\n\nThe median CrCL in the RE-COVER study was 100.4 mL/min. 21.7% of patients had mild renal \nimpairment (CrCL >50 - <80 mL/min) and 4.5% of patients had a moderate renal impairment (CrCL \n\n\n\n110\n\nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min). Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment had at steady state an \naverage 1.8-fold and 3.6-fold higher pre-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations compared with \npatients with CrCL >80 mL/min, respectively. Similar values for CrCL were found in RE-COVER II.\n\nThe median CrCL in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies were 99.0 mL/min and 99.7 mL/min, \nrespectively. 22.9% and 22.5% of the patients had a CrCL >50-<80 mL/min, and 4.1% and 4.8% had \na CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies.\n\nElderly patients\nSpecific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60% in the \nAUC and of more than 25% in Cmax compared to young subjects.\nThe effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31% \nhigher trough concentration for subjects ?75 years and by about 22% lower trough level for subjects \n<65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency \n(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBody weight\nThe dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20% lower in adult patients with a body weight \n>100 kg compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8%) of the subjects were in the ?50 kg and \n<100 kg category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in \nadult patients <50 kg are available.\n\nGender\nIn atrial fibrillation patients females had on average 30% higher trough and post-dose concentrations. \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 4.2).\n\nEthnic origin\nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic,\nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics.\n\nPaediatric population\nOral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted \nin exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT/PE. Based on the pooled analysis of \npharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1160.108, the observed geometric mean trough \nexposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to <2-year-old, 2 to <12-year-old and 12 \nto <18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nIn vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of \ncytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not \nshow any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin \n(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nEffects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \neffect of dabigatran.\n\n\n\n111\n\nAn effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in\npre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were \ntoxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body \nweight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the \npre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the \ndams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding \nevents at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile \nrats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in \nassociation with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile \ntoxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to \njuvenile animals.\n\nIn lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of \ndabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.\n\nDabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years of age.\n\nFor age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPradaxa coated granules can be used in children aged less than 12 years as soon as the child is able to \nswallow soft food. Pradaxa capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or older\nwho are able to swallow the capsules whole. Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution should only \nbe used in children aged less than 1 year.\n\nWhen changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated \nin the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed for the age and weight of the child.\n\nFor the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with \na parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be \ninitiated following previous treatment.\n\nDabigatran etexilate coated granules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one \ndose in the evening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close \nto 12 hours as possible.\n\n\n\n115\n\nThe recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate coated granules is based on the patient’s age and \nweight as shown in tables 1 and 2.

If a dose has only been \ntaken partially, there should be no attempt to administer a second dose at that time-point, and the next \ndose should be taken as scheduled approximately 12 hours later.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Caregivers should \nbe instructed to contact the treating physician if their treated child develops gastrointestinal symptoms \nsuch as dyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nPatients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate.\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis medicinal product is for oral use.\n\nThe coated granules should be mixed with food prior to intake and only be used with apple juice or the \nsoft foods mentioned in the instructions for use. After mixing with food or apple juice, the medicinal \nproduct has to be administered within 30 minutes. The coated granules are not compatible with milk or \nmilk products.\n\nThis medicinal product is not compatible with feeding tubes.\n\nDetailed instructions for the use of this medicinal product are provided in ‘Instructions for use’ in the \npackage leaflet.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n? Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n\n\n\n118\n\n? eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 in paediatric patients\n? Active clinically significant bleeding\n? Lesion or condition, if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities\n\n? Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), \noral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under specific circumstances. \nThese are switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses \nnecessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).\n\n? Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival\n? Concomitant treatment with the following strong P-gp inhibitors: systemic ketoconazole, \n\ncyclosporine, itraconazole, dronedarone and the fixed-dose combination \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir (see section 4.5)\n\n? Prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment (see section 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaemorrhagic risk\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or \nwith concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet \naggregation. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or \nhaematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.\n\nThe efficacy and safety of the specific reversal agent idarucizumab used for adult patients in situations \nof life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the anticoagulation effect of \ndabigatran is required, have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove \ndabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factor \nconcentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet concentrates are other \npossible options (see also section 4.9).\n\nUse of platelet aggregation inhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non \nsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or \ngastroesophageal reflux increase the risk of GI bleeding.\n\n\n\n119\n\nRisk factors\n\nTable 3 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk. \n\nTable 3: Risk factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk. \n\nRisk factor\nFactors increasing dabigatran plasma levels Major:\n\n? Strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.3 and \n4.5)\n\n? Mild to moderate P-gp inhibitor co-\nmedication (e.g. amiodarone, verapamil, \nquinidine and ticagrelor; see section 4.5)\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions (see section 4.5) ? ASA and other platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel\n\n? NSAIDs\n? SSRIs or SNRIs\n? Other medicinal products which may \n\nimpair haemostasis\nDiseases / procedures with special \nhaemorrhagic risks\n\n? Congenital or acquired coagulation \ndisorders\n\n? Thrombocytopenia or functional platelet \ndefects\n\n? Recent biopsy, major trauma\n? Bacterial endocarditis\n? Esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal \n\nreflux\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric \npatients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5).\n\nPrecautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk\n\nFor the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9.\n\nBenefit-risk assessment \n\nThe presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, \nantiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major \nbleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the \nbenefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nLimited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with \nactive meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran \netexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nClose clinical surveillance\n\nClose observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, \nespecially if risk factors are combined (see table 3 above). Particular caution should be exercised when \ndabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp \ninhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.5).\nClose observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nNSAIDs (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n120\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nPatients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate.\n\nWhen severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated.\nThe efficacy and safety of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran have not been \nestablished in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nLaboratory coagulation parameters\n\nAlthough this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the \nmeasurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to \ndabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors.\nDiluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test\nvariability (see section 5.1).\nThe international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false \npositive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore, INR tests should not be performed.\n\nCoagulation test thresholds at trough for paediatric patients that may be associated with an increased \nrisk of bleeding are not known.\n\nUse of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke\n\nThe use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be \nconsidered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal \n(ULN) according to the local reference range.\n\nSurgery and interventions \n\nPatients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for \nbleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran \netexilate.\n\nCaution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and \nanticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency \nmay take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such \ncases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still \nimpaired.\n\nEmergency surgery or urgent procedures\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. \n\nThe efficacy and safety of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran have not been \nestablished in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nSubacute surgery/interventions\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery / intervention should be delayed if \npossible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding \nmay be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention.\n\n\n\n121\n\nElective surgery\n\nIf possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical \nprocedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may \nbe required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery.\n\nDiscontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients are summarised in \ntable 4.\n\nTable 4: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients\n\nRenal function\n(eGFR in mL/min/1.73m2)\n\nStop dabigatran before elective surgery\n\n>80 24 hours before\n50 – 80 2 days before\n<50 These patients have not been studied (see section 4.3).\n\nSpinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture\n\nProcedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function.\n\nThe risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture \nand by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least \n2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients \nrequire frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma.\n\nPostoperative phase\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should be resumed / started after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has \nbeen established. \n\nPatients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure (see table 3) should be treated with \ncaution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nPatients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events\n\nThere are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and \ntherefore they should be treated with caution.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes >2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment \nexperience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate \nis not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any \nimpact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nInteraction with P-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma \nconcentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for \npatients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular \nfor patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 2-\n\n\n\n122\n\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.\n\nActive cancer patients\n\nThere is limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer.\n\nVery specific paediatric population\n\nFor some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption \nmay be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nTransporter interactions\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp \ninhibitors (see table 5) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.\n\nIf not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or \nanaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. See also sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nTable 5: Transporter interactions\n\nP-gp inhibitors\n\nConcomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\nKetoconazole Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values by 2.38-fold and \n2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold and \n2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once \ndaily. \n\nDronedarone When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total \ndabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, \nrespectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone bid, and about 2.1-fold \nand 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg. \n\nItraconazole, \ncyclosporine\n\nBased on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. \n\nGlecaprevir /\npibrentasvir\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of the \nP-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase exposure of \ndabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nTacrolimus Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-\ngp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate has not been \nclinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited clinical data with \nanother P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the inhibition of P-gp with \ntacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong P-gp inhibitors. \n\nCautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see section 4.4)\n\n\n\n123\n\nVerapamil When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the \nCmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this change \ndiffers depending on timing of administration and formulation of verapamil (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nThe greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an \nimmediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to the \ndabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC by about \n2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration of an \nextended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and AUC by about \n1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increase of Cmax by \nabout 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold).\n\nThere was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours \nafter dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC by about \n1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 2 hours.\n\nAmiodarone When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg\namiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active \nmetabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were \nincreased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the long half-life \nof amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks after \ndiscontinuation of amiodarone (see section 4.4).\n\nQuinidine Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1,000 mg. \nDabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day \neither with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on \naverage by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with concomitant quinidine (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nClarithromycin When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with \ndabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold and \nCmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. \n\nTicagrelor When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered \nsimultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC and \nCmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After multiple doses \nof ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. the increase of dabigatran exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-\nfold for Cmax and AUC, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss by \n1.49-fold  and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\nwas reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran \netexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended administration for \nstart of ticagrelor with a loading dose.\n\nConcomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor b.i.d. (maintenance dose) with \n110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\n1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone.\n\nPosaconazole Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. \nCaution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with \nposaconazole.\n\nP-gp inducers\n\n\n\n124\n\nConcomitant use should be avoided.\n\ne.g. rifampicin, \nSt. John´s wort \n(Hypericum \nperforatum), \ncarbamazepine, \nor phenytoin\n\nConcomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran \nconcentrations.\n\nPre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for \n7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5% and 67%, \nrespectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure \nclose to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No further \nincrease in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.\n\nProtease inhibitors such as ritonavir\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\ne.g. ritonavir \nand its \ncombinations \nwith other \nprotease \ninhibitors\n\nThese affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and \nare therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran etexilate.\n\nP-gp substrate\n\nDigoxin In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was \nco-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant \nchanges on dabigatran exposure have been observed.\n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nThere is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of \nbleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated \nheparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, \ndesirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral \nanticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa \nreceptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4).\n\nUFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter \n(see section 4.3).\n\n\n\n125\n\nTable 6: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with \nincreased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With \nchronic use in a phase III clinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke \nprevention in atrial fibrillation patients (RE-LY), NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding \nby approximately 50% on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin.\n\nClopidogrel In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran \netexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times \ncompared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss and \nthe coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation \nas measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined \ntreatment and the respective mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or \n600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40% (see \nsection 4.4) .\n\nASA Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the \nrisk for any bleeding from 12% to 18% and 24% with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nLMWH The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not \nbeen specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily \n40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to \ndabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of dabigatran etexilate \n(single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity was observed after \ndabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that after \ntreatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over \neffect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran \nrelated anti-coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of \nenoxaparin.\n\nOther interactions\n\nTable 7: Other interactions\n\nSelective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake \ninhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nSSRIs, SNRIs SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in all treatment groups of a phase III \nclinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial \nfibrillation patients (RE-LY).\n\nSubstances influencing gastric pH\n\nPantoprazole When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran \nAUC of approximately 30% was observed. Pantoprazole and other proton-pump \ninhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and concomitant \nPPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa.\n\nRanitidine Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran.\n\nInteractions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no \nin vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions \nare not expected with dabigatran.\n\n\n\n126\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Pradaxa in pregnant women.\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown.\n\nPradaxa should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding.\nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pradaxa.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data available.\n\nIn animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations \nand an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure \nlevel compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence \non male fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64,000 patients; \nthereof approximately 35,000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate. The safety of dabigatran \netexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients was studied in \ntwo phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1160.108). In total, 328 paediatric patients had been treated with \ndabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate \nformulation of dabigatran etexilate.\n\nOverall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults.\n\nIn total, 26% of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of \nrecurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 8 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and prevention \nof recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ Class (SOC) \nand frequency using the following convention: very common (?1/10), common (?1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (?1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (?1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\n\n\n127\n\nTable 8: Adverse reactions\n\nFrequency\n\nSOC / Preferred term. treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nAnaemia Common\nHaemoglobin decreased Uncommon\nThrombocytopenia Common\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon\nNeutropenia Uncommon\nAgranulocytosis Not known\n\nImmune system disorder\nDrug hypersensitivity Uncommon\nRash Common\nPruritus Uncommon\nAnaphylactic reaction Not known\nAngioedema Not known\nUrticaria Common\nBronchospasm Not known\n\nNervous system disorders\nIntracranial haemorrhage Uncommon\n\nVascular disorders\nHaematoma Common\nHaemorrhage Not known\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis Common\nHaemoptysis Uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon\nAbdominal pain Uncommon\nDiarrhoea Common\nDyspepsia Common\nNausea Common \nRectal haemorrhage Uncommon\nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Not known\nGastrointestinal ulcer, including \noesophageal ulcer\n\nNot known\n\nGastroesophagitis Uncommon\nGastroesophageal reflux disease Common\nVomiting Common\nDysphagia Uncommon\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nHepatic function abnormal/ Liver \nfunction Test abnormal\n\nNot known\n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nHepatic enzyme increased Common\nHyperbilirubinaemia Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorder\nSkin haemorrhage Uncommon \nAlopecia Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nHaemarthrosis Not known\n\n\n\n128\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nGenitourological haemorrhage, \nincluding haematuria\n\nUncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site haemorrhage Not known\nCatheter site haemorrhage Not known\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon\nIncision site haemorrhage Not known\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nBleeding reactions\n\nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of dabigatran etexilate may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ. The signs, symptoms, and severity \n(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding \nand/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were \nseen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. \nThus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of \nvalue to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. \nthose patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis \nor strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may \npresent as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and \nunexplained shock.\n\nKnown bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to \nhypoperfusion have been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n\nIn the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1%) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5%) a \nclinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9%) a minor bleeding event. The \nfrequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to <18 years: 28.6%) than \nin the younger age groups (birth to <2 years: 23.3%; 2 to <12 years: 16.2%). Major or severe bleeding, \nregardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of \nbleeding.\n\nIn case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the \ntime by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional \nmeasures e.g. dialysis have been initiated.\n\nExcessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran \nis excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n129\n\nis low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this \napproach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).\n\nManagement of bleeding complications\n\nIn the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and \nthe source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive \ntreatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the \nprescriber’s discretion.\n\nCoagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken \ninto account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in \nreversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and \nalso on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become \nunreliable following adminstration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be \nexercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of \nplatelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal \nproducts have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's \njudgement.\n\nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. \nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible \ndirect thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma.\nSince thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the \ncoagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free \nthrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant \nactivity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral \nadministration in various animal models of thrombosis.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant \neffect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT.\n\nThe calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma \nconcentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the \ncalibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of \nquantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered.\n\n\n\n130\n\nThe ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nThe aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation \nintensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable \nfor precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of \ndabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value \nindicates that the patient is anticoagulated.\n\nIn general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran \nlevels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate \ncompared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, non-\ninferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-\nappropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses \nadjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or \nvitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a \ncomposite endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and \nfreedom from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and \nintracranial abscess.\nIn total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran \netexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were \n12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than \n2 years. \nOf the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients \n(42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus \nresolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The \ncorresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent \nresults were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the \ntreatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the 3 \ndifferent age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the dabigatran \netexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1%) and 7/13 (53.8%) for patients from birth \nto <2 years, 21/43 (48.8%) and 12/21 (57.1%) for patients aged 2 to <12 years, and 47/112 (42.0%) \nand 19/56 (33.9%) for patients aged 12 to <18 years.\nAdjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and \n2 patients (2.2%) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first \nmajor bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6%) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients \n(24.4%) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The \ncombined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major \n(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4%) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group \nand 3 (3.3%) patients in the SOC group.\n\nAn open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was \nconducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the \npresence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least \n3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. \nEligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, \ncoated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a \nmaximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major \nand minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic \nevents) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication \ncommittee.\n\n\n\n131\n\nOverall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less \nthan 18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients \nin age stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients \n(1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. \nAdjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients \n(22.5%) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients \n(1.4%), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For \n3 patients (1.4%), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months. \nNo on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) developed post-\nthrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nOral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted \nin exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT / PE. Based on the pooled analysis of \npharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1160.108, the observed geometric mean trough \nexposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to <2-year-old, 2 to <12-year-old and 12 \nto <18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively.\n\nExperience from adults\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa capsules was \napproximately 6.5 %.\n\nAfter oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran \nin plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 \nand 2.0 hours post administration.\nA study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, \ndemonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth \nplasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma \nconcentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to \ncontributing factors such as anaesthesia, GI paresis, and surgical effects independent of the oral \nmedicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed \nabsorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran \nis rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration.\n\nFood does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma \nconcentrations by 2 hours. Pradaxa coated granules are not compatible with milk or milk products (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nCmax and AUC were dose proportional.\n\nDistribution\n\nIn adults, low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins \nwas observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60-70 L exceeded the volume of total body \nwater indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran.\n\n\n\n132\n\nBiotransformation\n\nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, \nwhich is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction.\n\nMetabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of \nradiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived \nradioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85%). Faecal excretion accounted for 6% of the \nadministered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94% of the administered dose \nby 168 hours post dose.\nDabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four \npositional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10% of total \ndabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical \nmethods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of \napproximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate.\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of \n11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was \nobserved. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as \nshown in table 9.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal insufficiency\nIn phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran \netexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL \nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency.\n\nIn a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the \nexposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately \n2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nTable 9: Half-life of total dabigatran in healthy subjects and subjects with impaired renal \nfunction (adults).\n\nglomerular filtration rate \n(CrCL,)\n\n[mL/min]\n\ngMean (gCV %; range) \nhalf-life \n\n[h] \n?80 13.4 (25.7 %; 11.0-21.6)\n\n?50-<80 15.3 (42.7 %;11.7-34.1) \n\n?30-<50 18.4 (18.5 %;13.3-23.0) \n<30 27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0)\n\nAdditionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label \nrandomised pharmacokinetic study in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with severe \nrenal impairment (defined as creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate \n75 mg twice daily.\nThis regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9%), \nmeasured immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak \nconcentration of 202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6%) measured two hours after the administration of the last \ndose.\n\nClearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 patients with end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow rate, \n\n\n\n133\n\nfour hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted in a \nremoval of 50% to 60% of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance cleared \nby dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The \nanticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD \nrelationship was not affected by the procedure.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency \n(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see section 4.4).\n\nGender\nIn atrial fibrillation patients females had on average 30% higher trough and post-dose concentrations.\nNo dose adjustment is recommended (see section 4.2).\n\nEthnic origin\nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nIn vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of \ncytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not \nshow any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin \n(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nEffects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \neffect of dabigatran.\n\nAn effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in \npre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were \ntoxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body \nweight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the \npre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the \ndams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding \nevents at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile \nrats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in \nassociation with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile \ntoxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to \njuvenile animals.\n\nIn lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of \ndabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.\n\nDabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.\n\n\n\n134\n\n6.

The dosing interval should be as close to \n12 hours as possible.\n\nThe recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate oral solution is based on the patient’s age and weight \nas shown in table 1. The table provides the single doses which are to be administered twice daily. The \ndose should be adjusted according to age and weight as treatment progresses.\n\n\n\n137\n\nTable 1: Single dabigatran etexilate dose in millilitres (mL) by weight in kilograms (kg) and \nage in months of the patient to be administered twice daily\n\nAge in months\n\n<1\n1 to\n<2\n\n2 to\n<3\n\n3 to\n<4\n\n4 to\n<5\n\n5 to\n<6\n\n6 to\n<7\n\n7 to\n<8\n\n8 to\n<9\n\n9 to \n<10\n\n10 to \n<11\n\n11 to \n<12\n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nt \n\n[k\ng]\n\n13 to <16 12 mL 12 mL\n\n11 to <13 10 mL 10 mL 10 mL 11 mL\n\n9 to <11 7 mL 7 mL 8 mL 8 mL 9 mL 9 mL 9 mL\n\n7 to <9 5 mL 6 mL 6 mL 7 mL 7 mL 7 mL 7 mL 8 mL 8 mL\n\n5 to <7 3 mL 3 mL 4 mL 4 mL 5 mL 5 mL 5 mL 5 mL 6 mL 6 mL 6 mL 7 mL\n\n4 to <5 2 mL 3 mL 3 mL 4 mL 4 mL 4 mL 4 mL 4 mL 5 mL 5 mL\n\n3 to <4 2 mL 2 mL 3 mL 3 mL 3 mL 3 mL\n\n2.5 to <3 2 mL 2 mL 2 mL 2 mL 3 mL\n\nMeans that no dosing recommendation can be provided.\n\noral solution \n[mL]\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\ncontains \ndabigatran \n\netexilate [mg]\n12.50 18.75 25.00 31.25 37.50 43.75 50.00 56.25 62.50 68.75 75.00\n\nThe maximum dose stated in the dosing table for Pradaxa oral solution must not be exceeded (see also \nsection 5.3).\n\nAssessment of renal function prior to and during treatment\n\nPrior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated \nusing the Schwartz formula.\n\nTreatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with an eGFR ? 50 mL/min/1.73m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 1.\n\nWhile on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected \nthat the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain \nco-medications, etc).\n\nDuration of use\n\nThe duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment.\n\n\n\n138\n\nMissed dose\n\nA forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. \nFrom 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. \nA double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken. If a dose has only been \ntaken partially, there should be no attempt to administer a second dose at that time-point, and the next \ndose should be taken as scheduled approximately 12 hours later.\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Caregivers should \nbe instructed to contact the treating physician if their treated child develops gastrointestinal symptoms \nsuch as dyspepsia (see section 4.8).\n\nSwitching\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant:\nIt is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a \nparenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5).\n\nParenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started \n0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of \ndiscontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA):\nPatients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate.\nBecause dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better \nreflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, \nINR values should be interpreted with caution.\n\nVKA to dabigatran etexilate:\nThe VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is <2.0.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis medicinal product is for oral use.\n\nInstructions For Use must be carefully followed. Detailed instructions for the preparation of the oral \nsolution and the administration with the dosing pipette are provided in ‘Instructions for use’ in the \npackage leaflet.\n\nPradaxa oral solution should be reconstituted by a healthcare professional. Caregivers may reconstitute \nthe oral solution themselves if the treating physician determines that it is appropriate.\n\nIn case the anticoagulant treatment has been initiated in the hospital and has to be continued after \ndischarge the following options are possible:\n? the treatment is continued with Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution if reconstitution of \n\nthe oral solution on a daily basis, either by a healthcare professional or a caregiver, is assured. \nThe instructions for use and particularly the storage conditions for the reconstituted oral solution \nhave to always be carefully followed.\n\n? the treatment is continued with Pradaxa coated granules\n? the treatment is continued with standard of care\n\nAfter reconstitution, Pradaxa oral solution is a clear colourless to clear yellowish solution. The pH of \nthe reconstituted oral solution is approximately 2.1.\n\n\n\n139\n\nThe oral solution should not be mixed with milk, other beverages or food.\n\nThe dosing pipettes provided are not compatible with feeding tubes. The oral solution should not be \nadministered via feeding tubes.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n? Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n? eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 in paediatric patients\n? Active clinically significant bleeding\n? Lesion or condition, if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities\n\n? Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), \noral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under specific circumstances. \nThese are switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses \nnecessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5).\n\n? Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival\n? Concomitant treatment with the following strong P-gp inhibitors: systemic ketoconazole, \n\ncyclosporine, itraconazole, dronedarone and the fixed-dose combination \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir (see section 4.5)\n\n? Prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment (see section 5.1).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaemorrhagic risk\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or \nwith concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet \naggregation. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or \nhaematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.\n\nThe efficacy and safety of the specific reversal agent idarucizumab used for adult patients in situations \nof life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the anticoagulation effect of \ndabigatran is required, have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove \ndabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factor \nconcentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet concentrates are other \npossible options (see also section 4.9).\n\nUse of platelet aggregation inhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non \nsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or \ngastroesophageal reflux increase the risk of GI bleeding.\n\n\n\n140\n\nRisk factors\n\nTable 2 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk. \n\nTable 2: Risk factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.\n\nRisk factor\nFactors increasing dabigatran plasma levels Major:\n\n? Strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.3 and \n4.5)\n\n? Mild to moderate P-gp inhibitor co-\nmedication (e.g. amiodarone, verapamil, \nquinidine and ticagrelor; see section 4.5)\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions (see section 4.5) ? ASA and other platelet aggregation \ninhibitors such as clopidogrel\n\n? NSAIDs\n? SSRIs or SNRIs\n? Other medicinal products which may \n\nimpair haemostasis\nDiseases / procedures with special \nhaemorrhagic risks\n\n? Congenital or acquired coagulation \ndisorders\n\n? Thrombocytopenia or functional platelet \ndefects\n\n? Recent biopsy, major trauma\n? Bacterial endocarditis\n? Esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal \n\nreflux\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric \npatients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5).\n\nPrecautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk\n\nFor the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9.\n\nBenefit-risk assessment \n\nThe presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, \nantiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major \nbleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the \nbenefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nLimited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with \nactive meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran \netexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks.\n\nClose clinical surveillance\n\nClose observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, \nespecially if risk factors are combined (see table 2 above). Particular caution should be exercised when \ndabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp \ninhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.5).\nClose observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with \nNSAIDs (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n141\n\nDiscontinuation of dabigatran etexilate\n\nPatients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate.\n\nWhen severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated.\nThe efficacy and safety of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran have not been \nestablished in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nLaboratory coagulation parameters\n\nAlthough this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the \nmeasurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to \ndabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors.\nDiluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test\nvariability (see section 5.1).\nThe international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false \npositive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore, INR tests should not be performed.\n\nCoagulation test thresholds at trough for paediatric patients that may be associated with an increased \nrisk of bleeding are not known.\n\nUse of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke\n\nThe use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be \nconsidered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal \n(ULN) according to the local reference range.\n\nSurgery and interventions \n\nPatients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for \nbleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran \netexilate.\n\nCaution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and \nanticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency \nmay take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such \ncases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still \nimpaired.\n\nEmergency surgery or urgent procedures\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. \n\nThe efficacy and safety of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran have not been \nestablished in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran.\n\nSubacute surgery/interventions\n\nDabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery / intervention should be delayed if \npossible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding \nmay be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention.\n\n\n\n142\n\nElective surgery\n\nIf possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical \nprocedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may \nbe required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery.\n\nDiscontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients are summarised in \ntable 3.\n\nTable 3: Discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for paediatric patients\n\nRenal function\n(eGFR in mL/min/1.73m2)\n\nStop dabigatran before elective surgery\n\n>80 24 hours before\n50 – 80 2 days before\n<50 These patients have not been studied (see section 4.3).\n\nSpinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture\n\nProcedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function.\n\nThe risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture \nand by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least \n2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients \nrequire frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma.\n\nPostoperative phase\n\nDabigatran etexilate treatment should be resumed / started after the invasive procedure or surgical \nintervention as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has \nbeen established. \n\nPatients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure (see table 2) should be treated with \ncaution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nPatients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events\n\nThere are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and \ntherefore they should be treated with caution.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes >2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment \nexperience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate \nis not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any \nimpact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nInteraction with P-gp inducers\n\nConcomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma \nconcentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for \npatients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular \nfor patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 2-\n\n\n\n143\n\nglycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of \nrecurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.\n\nActive cancer patients\n\nThere is limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer.\n\nVery specific paediatric population\n\nFor some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption \nmay be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nTransporter interactions\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp \ninhibitors (see table 4) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.\n\nIf not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or \nanaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. See also sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nTable 4: Transporter interactions\n\nP-gp inhibitors\n\nConcomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\nKetoconazole Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values by 2.38-fold and \n2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold and \n2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole once \ndaily. \n\nDronedarone When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total \ndabigatran AUC0-? and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, \nrespectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone bid, and about 2.1-fold \nand 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg. \n\nItraconazole,\ncyclosporine\n\nBased on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. \n\nGlecaprevir /\npibrentasvir\n\nThe concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of the \nP-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase exposure of \ndabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nTacrolimus Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-\ngp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate has not been \nclinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited clinical data with \nanother P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the inhibition of P-gp with \ntacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong P-gp inhibitors. \n\nCautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see section 4.4)\n\n\n\n144\n\nVerapamil When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, the \nCmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this change \ndiffers depending on timing of administration and formulation of verapamil (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nThe greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose of an \nimmediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior to the \ndabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC by about \n2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration of an \nextended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and AUC by about \n1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil (increase of Cmax by \nabout 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold).\n\nThere was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 2 hours \nafter dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC by about \n1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 2 hours.\n\nAmiodarone When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 600 mg\namiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active \nmetabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were \nincreased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the long half-life \nof amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks after \ndiscontinuation of amiodarone (see section 4.4).\n\nQuinidine Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1,000 mg. \nDabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, on the 3rd day \neither with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased on \naverage by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with concomitant quinidine (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nClarithromycin When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with \ndabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold and \nCmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. \n\nTicagrelor When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered \nsimultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC and \nCmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After multiple doses \nof ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. the increase of dabigatran exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-\nfold for Cmax and AUC, respectively.\n\nConcomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss by \n1.49-fold  and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 110 mg \ndabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\nwas reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran \netexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended administration for \nstart of ticagrelor with a loading dose.\n\nConcomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor b.i.d. (maintenance dose) with \n110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss\n1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given \nalone.\n\nPosaconazole Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. \nCaution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with \nposaconazole.\n\nP-gp inducers\n\n\n\n145\n\nConcomitant use should be avoided.\n\ne.g. rifampicin, \nSt. John´s wort \n(Hypericum \nperforatum), \ncarbamazepine, \nor phenytoin\n\nConcomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran \nconcentrations.\n\nPre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for \n7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5% and 67%, \nrespectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran exposure \nclose to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No further \nincrease in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.\n\nProtease inhibitors such as ritonavir\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\ne.g. ritonavir \nand its \ncombinations \nwith other \nprotease \ninhibitors\n\nThese affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and \nare therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran etexilate.\n\nP-gp substrate\n\nDigoxin In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was \nco-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant \nchanges on dabigatran exposure have been observed.\n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nThere is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of \nbleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated \nheparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, \ndesirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral \nanticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa \nreceptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4).\n\nUFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter \n(see section 4.3).\n\n\n\n146\n\nTable 5: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products\n\nNSAIDs NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with \nincreased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With \nchronic use in a phase III clinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke \nprevention in atrial fibrillation patients (RE-LY), NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding \nby approximately 50% on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. \n\nClopidogrel In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran \netexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times \ncompared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss and \nthe coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation \nas measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined \ntreatment and the respective mono-treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mg or \n600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUC?,ss and Cmax,ss were increased by about 30-40% (see \nsection 4.4) .\n\nASA Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the \nrisk for any bleeding from 12% to 18% and 24% with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nLMWH The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has not \nbeen specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once daily \n40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to \ndabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of dabigatran etexilate \n(single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity was observed after \ndabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-treatment compared to that after \ntreatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is considered to be due to the carry-over \neffect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran \nrelated anti-coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of \nenoxaparin.\n\nOther interactions\n\nTable 6: Other interactions\n\nSelective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake \ninhibitors (SNRIs)\n\nSSRIs, SNRIs SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in all treatment groups of a phase III \nclinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial \nfibrillation patients (RE-LY).\n\nSubstances influencing gastric pH\n\nPantoprazole When Pradaxa was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in the dabigatran \nAUC of approximately 30% was observed. Pantoprazole and other proton-pump \ninhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with Pradaxa in clinical trials, and concomitant \nPPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of Pradaxa.\n\nRanitidine Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran.\n\nInteractions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no \nin vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions \nare not expected with dabigatran.\n\n\n\n147\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution is intended to be used in children below the age of \n12 months.

Information in this section will not be relevant in the context of this patient group.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nDabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64,000 patients; \nthereof approximately 35,000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate. The safety of dabigatran \netexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients was studied in \ntwo phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1160.108). In total, 328 paediatric patients had been treated with \ndabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate \nformulation of dabigatran etexilate.\n\nOverall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults.\n\nIn total, 26% of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of \nrecurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 7 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and prevention \nof recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ Class (SOC) \nand frequency using the following convention: very common (?1/10), common (?1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (?1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (?1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 7: Adverse reactions\n\nFrequency\n\nSOC / Preferred term. treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nAnaemia Common\nHaemoglobin decreased Uncommon\nThrombocytopenia Common\nHaematocrit decreased Uncommon\nNeutropenia Uncommon\nAgranulocytosis Not known\n\nImmune system disorder\nDrug hypersensitivity Uncommon\nRash Common\nPruritus Uncommon\nAnaphylactic reaction Not known\nAngioedema Not known\nUrticaria Common\nBronchospasm Not known\n\n\n\n148\n\nNervous system disorders\nIntracranial haemorrhage Uncommon\n\nVascular disorders\nHaematoma Common\nHaemorrhage Not known\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nEpistaxis Common\nHaemoptysis Uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon\nAbdominal pain Uncommon\nDiarrhoea Common\nDyspepsia Common\nNausea Common \nRectal haemorrhage Uncommon\nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Not known\nGastrointestinal ulcer, including \noesophageal ulcer\n\nNot known\n\nGastroesophagitis Uncommon\nGastroesophageal reflux disease Common\nVomiting Common\nDysphagia Uncommon\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nHepatic function abnormal/ Liver \nfunction Test abnormal\n\nNot known\n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Uncommon\nHepatic enzyme increased Common\nHyperbilirubinaemia Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorder\nSkin haemorrhage Uncommon \nAlopecia Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nHaemarthrosis Not known\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nGenitourological haemorrhage, \nincluding haematuria\n\nUncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site haemorrhage Not known\nCatheter site haemorrhage Not known\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon\nIncision site haemorrhage Not known\n\n\n\n149\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nBleeding reactions\n\nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of dabigatran etexilate may be associated with an \nincreased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ. The signs, symptoms, and severity \n(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding \nand/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were \nseen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. \nThus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of \nvalue to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. \nthose patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis \nor strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may \npresent as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and \nunexplained shock.\n\nKnown bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to \nhypoperfusion have been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is \nto be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n\nIn the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in \npaediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1%) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5%) a \nclinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9%) a minor bleeding event. The \nfrequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to <18 years: 28.6%) than \nin the younger age groups (birth to <2 years: 23.3%; 2 to <12 years: 16.2%). Major or severe bleeding, \nregardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of \nbleeding.\n\nIn case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow prediction of the \ntime by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case additional \nmeasures e.g. dialysis have been initiated.\n\nExcessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran \nis excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding \nis low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this \napproach in clinical studies (see section 5.2).\n\nManagement of bleeding complications\n\nIn the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and \nthe source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive \ntreatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the \nprescriber’s discretion.\n\nCoagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n150\n\ninto account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in \nreversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and \nalso on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become \nunreliable following adminstration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be \nexercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of \nplatelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal \nproducts have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's \njudgement.\n\nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. \nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible \ndirect thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma.\nSince thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the \ncoagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free \nthrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant \nactivity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral \nadministration in various animal models of thrombosis.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant \neffect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT.\n\nThe calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma \nconcentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the \ncalibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of \nquantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered.\n\nThe ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nThe aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation \nintensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable \nfor precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of \ndabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value \nindicates that the patient is anticoagulated.\n\nIn general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran \nlevels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk.\n\n\n\n151\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate \ncompared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, non-\ninferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-\nappropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses \nadjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or \nvitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a \ncomposite endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and \nfreedom from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and \nintracranial abscess.\nIn total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran \netexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were \n12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than \n2 years. \nOf the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients \n(42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus \nresolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The \ncorresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent \nresults were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the \ntreatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the 3 \ndifferent age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the dabigatran \netexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1%) and 7/13 (53.8%) for patients from birth \nto <2 years, 21/43 (48.8%) and 12/21 (57.1%) for patients aged 2 to <12 years, and 47/112 (42.0%) \nand 19/56 (33.9%) for patients aged 12 to <18 years.\nAdjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and \n2 patients (2.2%) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first \nmajor bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6%) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients \n(24.4%) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The \ncombined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major \n(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4%) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group \nand 3 (3.3%) patients in the SOC group.\n\nAn open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was \nconducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric \npatients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the \npresence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least \n3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. \nEligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, \ncoated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a \nmaximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major \nand minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic \nevents) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication \ncommittee.\nOverall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less \nthan 18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients \nin age stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients \n(1.4%) had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. \nAdjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients \n(22.5%) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients \n(1.4%), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For \n3 patients (1.4%), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months. \nNo on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) developed post-\nthrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months.\n\n\n\n152\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nOral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted \nin exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT / PE. Based on the pooled analysis of \npharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1160.108, the observed geometric mean trough \nexposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to <2-year-old, 2 to <12-year-old and 12 \nto <18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively.\n\nExperience from adults\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of Pradaxa capsules was \napproximately 6.5%.\n\nAfter oral administration of Pradaxa in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran \nin plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained within 0.5 \nand 2.0 hours post administration.\nA study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, \ndemonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth \nplasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma \nconcentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to \ncontributing factors such as anaesthesia, GI paresis, and surgical effects independent of the oral \nmedicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed \nabsorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran \nis rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration.\n\nFood does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma \nconcentrations by 2 hours. Pradaxa oral solution should not be mixed with milk, other beverages or \nfood (see section 4.5).\n\nCmax and AUC were dose proportional.\n\nDistribution\n\nIn adults, low (34-35%) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins \nwas observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60-70 L exceeded the volume of total body \nwater indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nAfter oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, \nwhich is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by \nesterase-catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction.\n\nMetabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of \nradiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived \nradioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85%). Faecal excretion accounted for 6% of the \nadministered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94% of the administered dose \nby 168 hours post dose.\nDabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four \npositional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10% of total \ndabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical \nmethods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of \napproximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate.\n\n\n\n153\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of \n11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was \nobserved. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as \nshown in table 8.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal insufficiency\nIn phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran \netexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL \nbetween 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency.\n\nIn a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the \nexposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately \n2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nTable 8: Half-life of total dabigatran in healthy subjects and subjects with impaired renal \nfunction (adults).\n\nglomerular filtration rate \n(CrCL,)\n\n[mL/min]\n\ngMean (gCV %; range) \nhalf-life \n\n[h] \n?80 13.4 (25.7 %; 11.0-21.6)\n\n?50-<80 15.3 (42.7 %;11.7-34.1) \n\n?30-<50 18.4 (18.5 %;13.3-23.0) \n<30 27.2(15.3 %; 21.6-35.0)\n\nAdditionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label \nrandomised pharmacokinetic study in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with severe \nrenal impairment (defined as creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate \n75 mg twice daily.\nThis regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9%), \nmeasured immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak \nconcentration of 202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6%) measured two hours after the administration of the last \ndose.\n\nClearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 patients with end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow rate, \nfour hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted in a\nremoval of 50% to 60% of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance cleared \nby dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The \nanticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD \nrelationship was not affected by the procedure.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency \n(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see section 4.4).\n\nGender\nIn atrial fibrillation patients females had on average 30% higher trough and post-dose concentrations.\nNo dose adjustment is recommended (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n154\n\nEthnic origin\nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nIn vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of \ncytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not \nshow any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin \n(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nEffects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \neffect of dabigatran.\n\nAn effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in \npre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were \ntoxic to the mothers (5- to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body \nweight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the \npre- and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the \ndams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients).\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding\nevents at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile \nrats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in \nassociation with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile \ntoxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to \njuvenile animals.\n\nIn lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of \ndabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg. At doses exceeding the maximum recommended \nhuman dose for patients aged less than 1 year, a mesilate ester assumed to be mutagenic due to its \nstructure may be present above acceptable levels.\n\nDabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.\n\n6.

Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.\n\nTake Pradaxa as recommended for the following conditions:\n\nPrevention of blood clot formation after knee or hip replacement surgery\n\nThe recommended dose is 220 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg).\n\nIf your kidney function is decreased by more than half or if you are 75 years of age or older, the \nrecommended dose is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg).\n\nIf you are taking amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil containing medicines the recommended dose \nis 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg).\n\nIf you are taking verapamil containing medicines and your kidney function is decreased by more \nthan half, you should be treated with a reduced dose of 75 mg Pradaxa because your bleeding risk may \nbe increased.\n\nFor both surgery types, treatment should not be started if there is bleeding from the site of operation. If \nthe treatment cannot be started until the day after surgery, dosing should be started with 2 capsules \nonce a day.\n\nAfter knee replacement surgery\n\nYou should start treatment with Pradaxa within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, taking a single \ncapsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 10 days.\n\nAfter hip replacement surgery \nYou should start treatment with Pradaxa within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, taking a single \ncapsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 28-35 days.\n\nPrevention of brain or body vessel obstruction by blood clot formation developing after abnormal \nheart beats and Treatment of blood clots in the veins of your legs and lungs including prevention of \nblood clots from re-occurring in the vein of your legs and lungs\n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice a day.\n\nIf you are 80 years or older, the recommended dose is 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice a \nday.\n\nIf you are taking verapamil containing medicines, you should be treated with a reduced Pradaxa dose \nof 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice a day, because your bleeding risk may be increased.\n\nIf you have a potentially higher risk for bleeding, your doctor may decide to prescribe a dose of \n220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice a day.\n\nYou can continue to take this medicine if your heart beat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure \ncalled cardioversion. Take Pradaxa as your physician has told you.\n\nIf a medical device (stent) has been deployed in a blood vessel to keep it open in a procedure called \npercutaneous coronary intervention with stenting, you can be treated with Pradaxa after your physician \nhas decided that normal control of blood coagulation is achieved. Take Pradaxa as your physician has \ntold you.\n\n\n\n233\n\nTreatment of blood clots and prevention of blood clots from reoccurring in children\n\nPradaxa should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening, at \napproximately the same time every day.

Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nPradaxa affects blood clotting, so most side effects are related to signs such as bruising or bleeding.\nMajor or severe bleeding may occur, these constitute the most serious side effects and, regardless of \nlocation, may become disabling, life-threatening or even lead to death. In some cases these bleedings \nmay not be obvious.\n\n\n\n235\n\nIf you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of \nexcessive bleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling) consult your doctor immediately.
