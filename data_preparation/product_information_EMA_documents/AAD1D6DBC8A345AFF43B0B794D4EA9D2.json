NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVictoza 6 mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide*. One pre-filled pen contains 18 mg liraglutide in 3 ml. \n \n* human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue produced by recombinant DNA technology in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \nClear and colourless or almost colourless, isotonic solution; pH=8.15. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVictoza is indicated for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with \ninsufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise \n• as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or \n\ncontraindications \n• in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. \nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTo improve gastro-intestinal tolerability, the starting dose is 0.6 mg liraglutide daily. After at least one \nweek, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. Some patients are expected to benefit from an increase \nin dose from 1.2 mg to 1.8 mg and based on clinical response, after at least one week, the dose can be \nincreased to 1.8 mg to further improve glycaemic control. Daily doses higher than 1.8 mg are not \nrecommended. \n \nWhen Victoza is added to a sulfonylurea or insulin, a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin \nshould be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Combination therapy with \nsulfonylurea is only valid for adult patients. \n \nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose is not needed in order to adjust the dose of Victoza. Blood glucose \nself-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulfonylurea and insulin, particularly when Victoza \ntherapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin dose reduction is \nrecommended.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (>65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. There is \nno therapeutic experience in patients with end-stage renal disease, and Victoza is therefore not \nrecommended for use in these patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Victoza \nis not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo dose adjustment is required for adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. No data are \navailable for children below 10 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nVictoza must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n \nVictoza is administered once daily at any time, independent of meals, and can be injected \nsubcutaneously in the abdomen, in the thigh or in the upper arm. The injection site and timing can be \nchanged without dose adjustment. However, it is preferable that Victoza is injected around the same \ntime of the day, when the most convenient time of the day has been chosen. For further instructions on \nadministration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLiraglutide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis. \n \nLiraglutide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in insulin-dependent \npatients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2).  \n \nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart \nAssociation (NYHA) class IV, and liraglutide is therefore not recommended for use in these patients. \n \nThere is limited experience in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic gastroparesis. \nUse of liraglutide is not recommended in these patients since it is associated with transient \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.  \n \nAcute pancreatitis \n \nAcute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients should be \ninformed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide \nshould be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide should not be restarted (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nThyroid disease \n \nThyroid adverse events, such as goitre, have been reported in clinical trials and in particular in patients \nwith pre-existing thyroid disease. Liraglutide should therefore be used with caution in these patients. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nPatients receiving liraglutide in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nof hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by a reduction in the \ndose of sulfonylurea or insulin. \n \nDehydration \n \nSigns and symptoms of dehydration, including renal impairment and acute renal failure, have been \nreported in patients treated with liraglutide. Patients treated with liraglutide should be advised of the \npotential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid \nfluid depletion. \n \nExcipients \n \nVictoza contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, therefore the medicinal product is \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro, liraglutide has shown very low potential to be involved in pharmacokinetic interactions with \nother active substances related to cytochrome P450 and plasma protein binding. \n \nThe small delay of gastric emptying with liraglutide may influence absorption of concomitantly \nadministered oral medicinal products. Interaction studies did not show any clinically relevant delay of \nabsorption and therefore no dose adjustment is required. Few patients treated with liraglutide reported \nat least one episode of severe diarrhoea. Diarrhoea may affect the absorption of concomitant oral \nmedicinal products. \n \nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \n \nNo interaction study has been performed. A clinically relevant interaction with active substances with \npoor solubility or with narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin cannot be excluded. Upon initiation \nof liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, more frequent \nmonitoring of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended. \n \nParacetamol \n \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of paracetamol following a single dose of 1000 mg. \nParacetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was delayed up to 15 min. No dose \nadjustment for concomitant use of paracetamol is required. \n \nAtorvastatin \n \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin to a clinically relevant degree following \nsingle dose administration of atorvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is \nrequired when given with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was \ndelayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. \n \nGriseofulvin \n \nLiraglutide did not change the overall exposure of griseofulvin following administration of a single \ndose of griseofulvin 500 mg. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. \nDose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are \nnot required. \n \nDigoxin \n \nA single dose administration of digoxin 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC \nby 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median tmax was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. No adjustment of \n\n\n\n 5 \n\ndigoxin dose is required based on these results. \n \nLisinopril \n \nA single dose administration of lisinopril 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril \nAUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with \nliraglutide. No dose adjustment of lisinopril is required based on these results. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nLiraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12 and 13%, respectively, following \nadministration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 h with \nliraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of \neither ethinyloestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be \nunaffected when co-administered with liraglutide. \n \nInsulin \n \nNo pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between liraglutide and insulin \ndetemir when administering a single dose of insulin detemir 0.5 U/kg with liraglutide 1.8 mg at steady \nstate in patients with type 2 diabetes. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of liraglutide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nLiraglutide should not be used during pregnancy, and the use of insulin is recommended instead. If a \npatient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Victoza should be \ndiscontinued. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether liraglutide is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that the \ntransfer of liraglutide and metabolites of close structural relationship into milk is low. Non-clinical \nstudies have shown a treatment-related reduction of neonatal growth in suckling rat pups (see section \n5.3). Because of lack of experience, Victoza should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nApart from a slight decrease in the number of live implants, animal studies did not indicate harmful \neffects with respect to fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVictoza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using \nmachines, in particular when Victoza is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn five large long-term clinical phase 3a trials over 2,500 adult patients have received treatment with \nVictoza alone or in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea (with or without metformin) or \nmetformin plus rosiglitazone. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical trials were gastrointestinal disorders: \nnausea and diarrhoea were very common, whereas vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and \ndyspepsia were common. At the beginning of the therapy, these gastrointestinal adverse reactions may \noccur more frequently. These reactions usually diminish within a few days or weeks on continued \ntreatment. Headache and nasopharyngitis were also common. Furthermore, hypoglycaemia was \ncommon, and very common when liraglutide is used in combination with a sulfonylurea. Severe \nhypoglycaemia has primarily been observed when combined with a sulfonylurea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions reported in long-term phase 3a controlled trials, the LEADER trial (a \nlong-term cardiovascular outcome trial) and spontaneous (post-marketing) reports. Frequencies for all \nevents have been calculated based on their incidence in phase 3a clinical trials. \nFrequencies are defined as: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions from long-term controlled phase 3a trials, the long-term \n\ncardiovascular outcome trial (LEADER) and spontaneous (post-marketing) reports \n \n\nMedDRA \nsystem organ \nclasses \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Nasopharyngitis \nBronchitis \n\n   \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylactic \nreactions \n\n \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hypoglycaemia \nAnorexia \nAppetite decreased \n\nDehydration   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Headache \nDizziness \n\n   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Increased heart rate    \n\nGastrointestina\nl disorders \n\nNausea \nDiarrhoea \n\nVomiting \nDyspepsia \nAbdominal pain \nupper \nConstipation \nGastritis \nFlatulence \nAbdominal \ndistension \nGastroesophageal \nreflux disease \nAbdominal \ndiscomfort \nToothache \n\nDelayed \ngastric \nemptying \n\nIntestinal \nobstruction \n\nPancreatitis \n(including \nnecrotising \npancreatitis) \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Cholelithiasis \nCholecystitis \n\n  \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorder \n\n Rash Urticaria \nPruritus \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Renal \nimpairment \nRenal failure \nacute \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue \nInjection site \nreactions \n\nMalaise   \n\nInvestigations  Increased lipase* \nIncreased amylase* \n\n   \n\n* From controlled phase 3b and 4 clinical trials only where they were measured. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn a clinical trial with liraglutide as monotherapy, rates of hypoglycaemia reported with liraglutide \nwere lower than rates reported for patients treated with active comparator (glimepiride). The most \nfrequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nMost episodes of confirmed hypoglycaemia in clinical trials were minor. No episodes of severe \nhypoglycaemia were observed in the trial with liraglutide used as monotherapy. Severe hypoglycaemia \nmay occur uncommonly and has primarily been observed when liraglutide is combined with a \nsulfonylurea (0.02 events/patient year). Very few episodes (0.001 events/patient year) were observed \nwith administration of liraglutide in combination with oral antidiabetics other than sulfonylureas. The \nrisk of hypoglycaemia is low with combined use of basal insulin and liraglutide (1.0 events per patient \nyear, see section 5.1). In the LEADER trial, severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported at a lower \nrate with liraglutide vs placebo (1.0 vs 1.5 events per 100 patient years; estimated rate ratio 0.69 [0.51 \nto 0.93]) (see section 5.1). For patients treated with premix insulin at baseline and at least for the \nfollowing 26 weeks, the rate of severe hypoglycaemia for both liraglutide and placebo was 2.2 events \nper 100 patient years. \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nWhen combining liraglutide with metformin, 20.7% of patients reported at least one episode of \nnausea, and 12.6% of patients reported at least one episode of diarrhoea. When combining liraglutide \nwith a sulfonylurea, 9.1% of patients reported at least one episode of nausea and 7.9% of patients \nreported at least one episode of diarrhoea. Most episodes were mild to moderate and occurred in a \ndose-dependent fashion. With continued therapy, the frequency and severity decreased in most \npatients who initially experienced nausea. \n \nPatients >70 years may experience more gastrointestinal effects when treated with liraglutide. \nPatients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60–90 ml/min and 30–\n59 ml/min, respectively) may experience more gastrointestinal effects when treated with liraglutide. \n \nCholelithiasis and cholecystitis \nFew cases of cholelithiasis (0.4%) and cholecystitis (0.1%) have been reported during long-term, \ncontrolled phase 3a clinical trials with liraglutide. In the LEADER trial, the frequency of cholelithiasis \nand cholecystitis was 1.5% and 1.1% for liraglutide and 1.1% and 0.7% for placebo, respectively (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nWithdrawal \nThe incidence of withdrawal due to adverse reactions was 7.8% for liraglutide-treated patients and \n3.4% for comparator-treated patients in the long-term controlled trials (26 weeks or longer). The most \nfrequent adverse reactions leading to withdrawal for liraglutide-treated patients were nausea (2.8% of \npatients) and vomiting (1.5%). \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nInjection site reactions \nInjection site reactions have been reported in approximately 2% of patients receiving Victoza in long-\nterm (26 weeks or longer) controlled trials. These reactions have usually been mild. \n \nPancreatitis \nFew cases of acute pancreatitis (<0.2%) have been reported during long-term, controlled phase 3 \nclinical trials with Victoza. Pancreatitis was also reported from marketed use. In the LEADER trial, \nthe frequency of acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication was 0.4% for liraglutide and 0.5% for \nplacebo, respectively (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions including urticaria, rash and pruritus have been reported from marketed use of \nVictoza. \nFew cases of anaphylactic reactions with additional symptoms such as hypotension, palpitations, \ndyspnoea and oedema have been reported with marketed use of Victoza. Few cases (0.05%) of \nangioedema have been reported during all long-term clinical trials with Victoza. \n \nPaediatric population \nOverall, frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in adolescents and children aged 10 years \nand above were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Rate of confirmed \nhypoglycaemic episodes was higher with liraglutide (0.58 events/patient year) compared to placebo \n(0.29 events/patient year). In patients treated with insulin prior to a confirmed hypoglycaemic episode \nthe rate was higher with liraglutide (1.82 events/patient year) compared to placebo (0.91 events/patient \nyears). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide treatment group.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nFrom clinical trials and marketed use, overdoses have been reported of up to 40 times (72 mg) the \nrecommended maintenance dose. Generally, the patients reported severe nausea, vomiting and \ndiarrhoea. None of the patients reported severe hypoglycaemia. All patients recovered without \ncomplications. \nIn the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the \npatient’s clinical signs and symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues. ATC \ncode: A10BJ02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLiraglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 97% sequence homology to human GLP-1 that binds to and \nactivates the GLP-1 receptor. The GLP-1 receptor is the target for native GLP-1, an endogenous \nincretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells. \nUnlike native GLP-1, liraglutide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans \nsuitable for once daily administration. Following subcutaneous administration, the protracted action \nprofile is based on three mechanisms: self-association, which results in slow absorption; binding to \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 9 \n\nalbumin; and higher enzymatic stability towards the dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP-4) and neutral \nendopeptidase (NEP) enzymes, resulting in a long plasma half-life. \n \nLiraglutide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors, leading to an increase in \ncyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-\ndependent manner. Simultaneously, liraglutide lowers inappropriately high glucagon secretion, also in \na glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and \nglucagon secretion is inhibited. Conversely, during hypoglycaemia liraglutide diminishes insulin \nsecretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also \ninvolves a minor delay in gastric emptying. Liraglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass \nthrough mechanisms involving reduced hunger and lowered energy intake, GLP-1 is a physiological \nregulator of appetite and food intake, but the exact mechanism of action is not entirely clear.  \n \nIn animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide led to uptake in specific brain regions \ninvolved in regulation of appetite, where liraglutide via specific activation of the GLP-1 receptor \n(GLP-1R) increased key satiety and decreased key hunger signals, thereby leading to lower body \nweight. \n \nGLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system, and \nkidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and \nreduced inflammation in the plaque. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids. \nLiraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established plaques. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLiraglutide has 24-hour duration of action and improves glycaemic control by lowering fasting and \npostprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBoth improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are \nan integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes. \n \nFive double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical phase 3a adult trials were conducted to evaluate the \neffects of liraglutide on glycaemic control (Table 2). Treatment with liraglutide produced clinically \nand statistically significant improvements in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma \nglucose and postprandial glucose compared with placebo. \n \nThese trials included 3,978 exposed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (2,501 patients treated with \nliraglutide), 53.7% men and 46.3% women, 797 patients (508 treated with liraglutide) were ≥65 years \nof age and 113 patients (66 treated with liraglutide) were ≥75 years of age. \n \nAdditional trials were conducted with liraglutide that included 1,901 patients in four unblinded, \nrandomised, controlled clinical trials (including 464, 658, 323 and 177 patients per trial) and one \ndouble-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \nmoderate renal impairment (279 patients). \n \nA large cardiovascular outcomes trial (the LEADER trial) was also conducted with liraglutide in 9,340 \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular risk. \n \n• Glycaemic control \nMonotherapy \nLiraglutide monotherapy for 52 weeks resulted in statistically significant and sustained reductions in \nHbA1c compared with glimepiride 8 mg (-0.84% for 1.2 mg, -1.14% for 1.8 mg vs -0.51% for \ncomparator) in patients previously treated with either diet and exercise or OAD monotherapy at no \nmore than half-maximal dose (Table 2). \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nCombination with oral antidiabetics \nLiraglutide in combination therapy, for 26 weeks, with metformin, glimepiride or metformin and \nrosiglitazone or SGLT2i ± metformin resulted in statistically significant  and sustained reductions in \nHbA1c compared with patients receiving placebo (Table 2). \n \nTable 2 Liraglutide clinical phase 3 trials in monotherapy (52 weeks) and in combination \n\nwith oral antidiabetics (26 weeks) \n \n\n N Mean \nbaseline \nHbA1c (%) \n\nMean HbA1c \nchange from \nbaseline (%) \n\nPatients (%) \nachieving \nHbA1c<7% \n\nMean \nbaseline \nweight (kg) \n\nMean \nweight \nchange from \nbaseline \n(kg) \n\nMonotherapy \nLiraglutide 1.2 mg 251 8.18 -0.84* 42.81, 58.33 92.1 -2.05** \nLiraglutide 1.8 mg 246 8.19 -1.14** 50.91, 62.03 92.6 -2.45** \nGlimepiride 8 mg/day 248 8.23 -0.51 27.81, 30.83 93.3 1.12 \nAdd-on to metformin (2,000 mg/day) \nLiraglutide 1.2 mg 240 8.3 -0.97† 35.31, 52.82 88.5 -2.58** \nLiraglutide 1.8 mg 242 8.4 -1.00† 42.41, 66.32 88.0 -2.79** \nPlacebo 121 8.4 0.09 10.81, 22.52 91.0 -1.51 \nGlimepiride 4 mg/day 242 8.4 -0.98 36.31, 56.02 89.0 0.95 \nAdd-on to glimepiride (4 mg/day) \nLiraglutide 1.2 mg 228 8.5 -1.08** 34.51, 57.42 80.0 0.32** \nLiraglutide 1.8 mg 234 8.5 -1.13** 41.61, 55.92 83.0 -0.23** \nPlacebo 114 8.4 0.23 7.51, 11.82 81.9 -0.10 \nRosiglitazone 4 \nmg/day \n\n231 8.4 -0.44 21.91, 36.12 80.6 2.11 \n\nAdd-on to metformin (2,000 mg/day) + rosiglitazone (4 mg twice daily) \nLiraglutide 1.2 mg 177 8.48 -1.48 57.51 95.3 -1.02 \nLiraglutide 1.8 mg 178 8.56 -1.48 53.71 94.9 -2.02 \nPlacebo 175 8.42 -0.54 28.11 98.5 0.60 \nAdd-on to metformin (2,000 mg/day) + glimepiride (4 mg/day) \nLiraglutide 1.8 mg 230 8.3 -1.33* 53.11 85.8 -1.81** \nPlacebo 114 8.3 -0.24 15.31 85.4 -0.42 \nInsulin glargine4  232 8.1 -1.09 45.81 85.2 1.62 \nAdd-on to SGLT2i5 ± metformin (≥1500 mg/day) \nLiraglutide 1.8 mg 203 8.00 -1.02*** 54.8*** 91.0 -2.92 \nPlacebo 100 7.96 -0.28 13.9 91.4 -2.06 \n\n*Superiority (p<0.01) vs active comparator; **Superiority (p<0.0001) vs active comparator; ***Superiority \n(p<0.001) vs active comparator, †Non-inferiority (p<0.0001) vs active comparator \n1all patients; 2previous OAD monotherapy; 3previous diet treated patients \n5Victoza add-on to SGLT2i was investigated at all approved doses of SGLT2i \n4the dosing of insulin glargine was open-labelled and was applied according to Guideline for titration of insulin \nglargine.

In the insulin degludec + liraglutide arm, the insulin dose was reduced by 20% in \norder to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia. Addition of liraglutide resulted in a statistically \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nsignificantly greater reduction of HbA1c (-0.73% for liraglutide vs -0.40% for comparator) and body \nweight (-3.03 vs 0.72 kg). The rate of hypoglycaemic episodes (per patient year of exposure) was \nstatistically significantly lower when adding liraglutide compared to adding a single dose of insulin \naspart (1.0 vs 8.15; ratio: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21). \n \nIn a 52-week clinical trial, the addition of insulin detemir to liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin in \npatients not achieving glycaemic targets on liraglutide and metformin alone resulted in a HbA1c \ndecrease from baseline of 0.54%, compared to 0.20% in the liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin control \ngroup. Weight loss was sustained. There was a small increase in the rate of minor hypoglycaemic \nepisodes (0.23 versus 0.03 events per patient years). \n \nIn the LEADER trial, (see subsection Cardiovascular evaluation), 873 patients were on premix insulin \n(with or without OAD(s)) at baseline and at least for the following 26 weeks. The mean HbA1c at \nbaseline was 8.7% for liraglutide and placebo. At week 26, the estimated mean change in HbA1c \nwas -1.4% and -0.5% for liraglutide and placebo, respectively, with an estimated treatment difference \nof -0.9 [-1.00; -0.70]95% CI. The safety profile of liraglutide in combination with premix insulin was \noverall comparable to that observed for placebo in combination with premix insulin (see section 4.8). \n \nUse in patients with renal impairment \nIn a double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg versus placebo as add-\non to insulin and/or OAD in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment, liraglutide \nwas superior to placebo treatment in reducing HbA1c after 26 weeks (-1.05% vs -0.38%). Significantly \nmore patients achieved HbA1c below 7% with liraglutide compared with placebo (52.8% vs 19.5%). In \nboth groups a decrease in body weight was seen: -2.4 kg with liraglutide vs -1.09 kg with placebo. \nThere was a comparable risk of hypoglycaemic episodes between the two treatment groups. The safety \nprofile of liraglutide was generally similar to that observed in other studies with liraglutide. \n \n• Proportion of patients achieving reductions in HbA1c \nLiraglutide alone resulted in a statistically significant greater proportion of patients achieving HbA1c \n≤6.5% at 52 weeks compared with patients receiving glimepiride (37.6% for 1.8 mg and 28.0% for \n1.2 mg vs 16.2% for comparator). \n \nLiraglutide in combination with metformin, glimepiride, metformin and rosiglitazone or SGLT2i ± \nmetformin resulted in a statistically significant greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c \n≤6.5% at 26 weeks compared with patients receiving these agents alone. \n \n• Fasting plasma glucose \nTreatment with liraglutide alone and in combination with one or two oral antidiabetic drugs resulted in \na reduction in fasting plasma glucose of 13–43.5 mg/dl (0.72–2.42 mmol/l). This reduction was \nobserved within the first two weeks of treatment. \n \n• Postprandial glucose \nLiraglutide reduced postprandial glucose across all three daily meals by 31–49 mg/dl (1.68–\n2.71 mmol/l). \n \n• Beta-cell function \nClinical trials with liraglutide indicate improved beta-cell function based on measures such as the \nhomeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and the proinsulin to insulin ratio. \nImproved first and second phase insulin secretion after 52 weeks treatment with liraglutide was \ndemonstrated in a subset of patients with type 2 diabetes (n=29). \n \n• Body weight \nTreatment with liraglutide in combination with metformin, metformin and glimepiride, metformin and \nrosiglitazone or SGLT2i with or without metformin was associated with a sustained weight reduction \nin the range from 0.86 kg to 2.62 kg compared with placebo. \n \nLarger weight reduction was observed with increasing body mass index (BMI) at baseline. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \n• Cardiovascular evaluation \nPost-hoc analysis of serious major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial \ninfarction, stroke) from all intermediate and long-term phase 2 and 3 trials (ranging from 26 and up to \n100 weeks duration) including 5,607 patients (3,651 exposed to liraglutide), showed no increase in \ncardiovascular risk (incidence ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.35; 1.63)) for liraglutide versus all comparators. \n \nThe Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results \n(LEADER) trial, was a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. 9,340 patients were \nrandomly allocated to either liraglutide (4,668) or placebo (4,672), both in addition to standards of \ncare for HbA1c and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Primary outcome or vital status at end of trial was \navailable for 99.7% and 99.6% of participants randomised to liraglutide and placebo, respectively. The \nduration of observation was a minimum of 3.5 years and up to a maximum of 5 years. The study \npopulation included patients ≥65 years (n=4,329) and ≥75 years (n=836) and patients with mild \n(n=3,907), moderate (n=1,934) or severe (n=224) renal impairment. The mean age was 64 years and \nthe mean BMI was 32.5 kg/m². The mean duration of diabetes was 12.8 years. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse \ncardiovascular events (MACE): CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. \nLiraglutide was superior in preventing MACE vs placebo (Figure 1). The estimated hazard ratio was \nconsistently below 1 for all 3 MACE components. \n \nLiraglutide also significantly reduced the risk of expanded MACE (primary MACE, unstable angina \npectoris leading to hospitalisation, coronary revascularisation, or hospitalisation due to heart failure) \nand other secondary endpoints (Figure 2). \n \n\n  \n\nPa\ntie\n\nnt\ns w\n\nith\n a\n\nn \nev\n\nen\nt (\n\n%\n) \n\nTime from randomisation (months) \nPatients at risk \n\nFAS: full analysis set. \n\nPlacebo \nVictoza \n\nHR: 0.87 \n95% CI [0.78; 0.97] \n\np<0.001 for non-inferiority \np=0.005 for superiority \n\nPlacebo \nVictoza \n\n4672 \n4668 \n\n4587 \n4593 \n\n4473 \n4496 \n\n4352 \n4400 \n\n4237 \n4280 \n\n4123 \n4172 \n\n4010 \n4072 \n\n3914 \n3982 \n\n1543 \n1562 \n\n407 \n424 \n\n \nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier plot of time to first MACE – FAS population \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n    Hazard Ratio (95% CI) Victoza N (%) Placebo N (%) \n\nFAS: full analysis set \nCI: confidence interval  \nMACE: major adverse cardiovascular event \n%: proportion in percent of subjects with an event \nN: number of subjects \n\n \n\nFavours Victoza Favours Placebo \n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2 \n\nPrimary endpoint – MACE \n\nComponents of MACE: \n\n \n\nFAS \n\nCardiovascular death \n\nNon-fatal stroke \n\nNon-fatal myocardial infarction \n\nExpanded MACE \n\nAdditional components in expanded MACE: \n\nUnstable angina pectoris (hospitalisation) \n\nCoronary revascularisation \n\nHeart failure (hospitalisation) \n\nOther secondary endpoints: \n\nAll cause death \n\nNon-cardiovascular death \n\n1 \n\n0.87 \n(0.78-0.97) \n\n0.78  \n(0.66-0.93) \n\n0.89  \n(0.72-1.11) \n\n0.88 \n(0.75-1.03) \n\n0.88  \n(0.81-0.96) \n\n0.98 \n(0.76-1.26) \n\n0.91 \n(0.80-1.04) \n\n0.87 \n(0.73-1.05) \n\n0.85 \n(0.74-0.97) \n\n0.95 \n(0.77-1.18) \n\n608 \n(13.0) \n\n219 \n(4.7) \n159  \n(3.4) \n281  \n(6.0) \n948  \n\n(20.3) \n\n122 \n(2.6) \n405 \n(8.7) \n218 \n(4.7) \n\n381 \n(8.2) \n162 \n(3.5) \n\n694 \n(14.9) \n\n278  \n(6.0) \n177  \n(3.8) \n317  \n(6.8) \n1062  \n(22.7) \n\n124 \n(2.7) \n441 \n(9.4) \n248 \n(5.3) \n\n447 \n(9.6) \n169 \n(3.6) \n\n4668 \n(100) 4672 (100) \n\n \nFigure 2: Forest plot of analyses of individual cardiovascular event types – FAS population \n \nA significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c from baseline to month 36 was observed with \nliraglutide vs placebo, in addition to standard of care (-1.16% vs -0.77%; estimated treatment \ndifference [ETD] -0.40% [-0.45; -0.34]). The need for treatment intensification with insulin was \nreduced by 48% with liraglutide vs placebo in insulin-naive patients at baseline (HR 0.52 [0.48; \n0.57]). \n \n• Blood pressure and heart rate \nOver the duration of the phase 3a trials, liraglutide decreased the systolic blood pressure on average of \n2.3 to 6.7 mmHg from baseline and compared to active comparator the decrease was 1.9 to 4.5 mmHg. \nA mean increase in heart rate from baseline of 2 to 3 beats per minute has been observed with \nliraglutide in long-term clinical trials including LEADER. In the LEADER trial, no long-term clinical \nimpact of increased heart rate on the risk of cardiovascular events was observed. \n \n• Microvascular evaluation \nIn the LEADER trial, microvascular events comprised nephropathy and retinopathy outcomes. The \nanalysis of time to first microvascular event for liraglutide vs placebo had a HR of 0.84 [0.73, 0.97]. \nThe HR for liraglutide vs placebo was 0.78 [0.67, 0.92] for time to first nephropathy event and 1.15 \n[0.87, 1.52] for time to first retinopathy event. \n \n• Immunogenicity \nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or \npeptides, patients may develop anti-liraglutide antibodies following treatment with liraglutide. On \naverage, 8.6% of patients developed antibodies. Antibody formation has not been associated with \nreduced efficacy of liraglutide. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn a double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of Victoza 1.8 mg versus placebo as add-on \nto metformin ± insulin in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes, \nVictoza was superior to placebo treatment in reducing HbA1c after 26 weeks (-1.06, [-1.65, 0.46]). The \ntreatment difference in HbA1c was 1.3% after additional 26 weeks of open label extension, confirming \nthe sustained glycaemic control with Victoza. \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nThe efficacy and safety profile of Victoza was comparable to that observed in the adult population \ntreated with Victoza. Based on adequate glycaemic control or tolerability, 30% of trial subjects \nremained on a dose of 0.6 mg, 17% escalated to a dose of 1.2 mg and 53% escalated to a dose of \n1.8 mg. \n \nOther clinical data \n \nIn an open label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of liraglutide (1.2 mg and 1.8 mg) and \nsitagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor, 100 mg) in patients inadequately controlled on metformin therapy \n(mean HbA1c 8.5%), liraglutide at both doses was statistically superior to sitagliptin treatment in \nreducing HbA1c after 26 weeks (-1.24%, -1.50% vs -0.90%, p<0.0001). Patients treated with \nliraglutide had a significant decrease in body weight compared to that of patients treated with \nsitagliptin (-2.9 kg and -3.4 kg vs -1.0 kg, p<0.0001). Greater proportions of patients treated with \nliraglutide experienced transient nausea vs patients treated with sitagliptin (20.8% and 27.1% for \nliraglutide vs 4.6% for sitagliptin). The reductions in HbA1c and superiority vs sitagliptin observed \nafter 26 weeks of liraglutide treatment (1.2 mg and 1.8 mg) were sustained after 52 weeks of treatment \n(-1.29% and -1.51% vs -0.88%, p<0.0001). Switching patients from sitagliptin to liraglutide after \n52 weeks of treatment resulted in additional and statistically significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.24% \nand -0.45%, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.07 and -0.67 to -0.23) at week 78, but a formal control group was not \navailable. \n \nIn an open label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily and exenatide \n10 mcg twice daily in patients inadequately controlled on metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy \n(mean HbA1c 8.3%), liraglutide was statistically superior to exenatide treatment in reducing HbA1c \nafter 26 weeks (-1.12% vs -0.79%; estimated treatment difference: -0.33; 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.18). \nSignificantly more patients achieved HbA1c below 7% with liraglutide compared with exenatide \n(54.2% vs 43.4%, p=0.0015). Both treatments resulted in mean body weight loss of approximately \n3 kg. Switching patients from exenatide to liraglutide after 26 weeks of treatment resulted in an \nadditional and statistically significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.32%, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.24) at week 40, \nbut a formal control group was not available. During the 26 weeks, there were 12 serious events in 235 \npatients (5.1%) using liraglutide, whereas there were 6 serious adverse events in 232 patients (2.6%) \nusing exenatide. There was no consistent pattern with respect to system organ class of events. \n \nIn an open label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg with lixisenatide 20 mcg \nin 404 patients inadequately controlled on metformin therapy (mean HbA1c 8.4%), liraglutide was \nsuperior to lixisenatide in reducing HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment (-1.83% vs -1.21%, p<0.0001). \nSignificantly more patients achieved HbA1c below 7% with liraglutide compared to lixisenatide \n(74.2% vs 45.5%, p<0.0001), as well as the HbA1c target below or equal 6.5% (54.6% vs 26.2%, \np<0.0001). Body weight loss was observed in both treatment arms (-4.3 kg with liraglutide and -3.7 kg \nwith lixisenatide). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequently reported with liraglutide \ntreatment (43.6% vs 37.1%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absorption of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is slow, reaching maximum \nconcentration 8–12 hours post dosing. Estimated maximum liraglutide concentration was 9.4 nmol/l \n(mean body weight approximately 73 kg) for a subcutaneous single dose of liraglutide 0.6 mg. At \n1.8 mg liraglutide, the average steady state concentration of liraglutide (AUCτ/24) reached \napproximately 34 nmol/l (mean body weight approximately 76 kg). The exposure of liraglutide \ndecreases with increasing body weight. Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with dose. The \nintra-subject coefficient of variation for liraglutide AUC was 11% following single dose \nadministration. \nAbsolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. \n \nDistribution \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \nThe apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration is 11–17 l. The mean volume of \ndistribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 l/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound \nto plasma proteins (>98%). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDuring 24 hours following administration of a single radiolabelled [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy \nsubjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Two minor plasma metabolites were \ndetected (≤9% and ≤5% of total plasma radioactivity exposure). Liraglutide is metabolised in a similar \nmanner to large proteins without a specific organ having been identified as major route of elimination. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or faeces. Only a minor \npart of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or faeces \n(6% and 5%, respectively). The urine and faeces radioactivity was mainly excreted during the first 6–\n8 days, and corresponded to three minor metabolites, respectively. \n \nThe mean clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose liraglutide is \napproximately 1.2 l/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nAge had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results from a \npharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects and population pharmacokinetic data analysis of patients \n(18 to 80 years). \n \nGender \nGender had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results \nof population pharmacokinetic data analysis of male and female patients and a pharmacokinetic study \nin healthy subjects. \n \nEthnic origin \nEthnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the \nresults of population pharmacokinetic analysis which included patients of White, Black, Asian and \nHispanic groups. \n \nObesity \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that body mass index (BMI) has no significant effect on \nthe pharmacokinetics of liraglutide. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was evaluated in patients with varying degree of hepatic \nimpairment in a single-dose trial. Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13–23% in patients with mild \nto moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. \nExposure was significantly lower (44%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh \nscore >9). \n \nRenal impairment \nLiraglutide exposure was reduced in patients with renal impairment compared to individuals with \nnormal renal function. Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 33%, 14%, 27% and 26% in patients with \nmild (creatinine clearance, CrCl 50–80 ml/min), moderate (CrCl 30–50 ml/min), and severe (CrCl \n<30 ml/min) renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, respectively. \n \nSimilarly, in a 26-week clinical trial, patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n(CrCL 30–59 ml/min, see section 5.1) had 26% lower liraglutide exposure when compared with a \nseparate trial including patients with type 2 diabetes with normal renal function or mild renal \nimpairment.  \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic properties were assessed in clinical studies in the paediatric population with type 2 \ndiabetes aged 10 years and above. The liraglutide exposure in adolescents and children was \ncomparable to that observed in the adult population. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity. \n \nNon-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours were seen in 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. In rats, \na no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not observed. These tumours were not seen in \nmonkeys treated for 20 months. These findings in rodents are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific \nGLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for \nhumans is likely to be low but cannot be completely excluded. No other treatment-related tumours \nhave been found. \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility but slightly increased \nearly embryonic deaths at the highest dose. Dosing with Victoza during mid-gestation caused a \nreduction in maternal weight and foetal growth with equivocal effects on ribs in rats and skeletal \nvariation in the rabbit. Neonatal growth was reduced in rats while exposed to Victoza, and persisted in \nthe post-weaning period in the high dose group. It is unknown whether the reduced pup growth is \ncaused by reduced pup milk intake due to a direct GLP-1 effect or reduced maternal milk production \ndue to decreased caloric intake. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nVictoza 6 mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nLiraglutide \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n– Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n– This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n– If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Victoza is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Victoza \n3. How to use Victoza \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Victoza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Victoza is and what it is used for \n \nVictoza contains the active substance liraglutide. It helps your body reduce your blood sugar level \nonly when blood sugar is too high. It also slows food passage through your stomach and can help \nprevent heart disease. \n \nVictoza is used on its own if your blood sugar is not properly controlled by diet and exercise alone, \nand you cannot use metformin (another diabetes medicine). \n \nVictoza is used with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood \nsugar levels. These may include: \n• oral antidiabetics (such as metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, sodium-glucose cotransporter \n\n2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)) and/or insulin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Victoza \n \nDo not use Victoza \n– if you are allergic to liraglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse: \n• before using Victoza. \n• if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. \n \nThis medicine should not be used if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin) \nor diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar and increase in effort to \nbreathe). It is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. \n \nThe use of Victoza is not recommended if you are on dialysis. \nThe use of Victoza is not recommended if you have severe liver disease. \nThe use of Victoza is not recommended if you have severe heart failure. \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n \nThis medicine is not recommended if you have a severe stomach or gut problem which results in \ndelayed stomach emptying (called gastroparesis), or inflammatory bowel disease. \n \nIf you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, such as persistent, severe stomach ache, you should \nconsult your doctor immediately (see section 4). \n \nIf you have thyroid disease including thyroid nodules and enlargement of the thyroid gland, consult \nyour doctor. \n \nWhen initiating treatment with Victoza, you may in some cases experience loss of fluids/dehydration, \ne.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty \nof fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVictoza can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. No data are available in \nchildren below 10 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Victoza \nPlease tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing any of the \nfollowing active substances: \n• Sulfonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide) or insulin. You may get hypoglycaemia \n\n(low blood sugar) when using Victoza together with a sulfonylurea or insulin, as sulfonylureas \nand insulin increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. When you first start using these medicines \ntogether, your doctor may tell you to lower the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin. Please see \nsection 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. If you are also taking a sulfonylurea (such as \nglimepiride or glibenclamide) or insulin, your doctor may tell you to test your blood sugar \nlevels. This will help your doctor to decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be \nchanged. \n\n• If you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will \nrecommend you to monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid hyperglycaemia \n(high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the \nbody is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). \n\n• Warfarin or other oral anti-coagulation medicines. More frequent blood testing to determine the \nability of your blood to clot may be required. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are, you think you might be, or are planning to become pregnant. Victoza \nshould not be used during pregnancy because it is not known if it may harm your unborn child. \n \nIt is not known if Victoza passes into breast milk, therefore do not use this medicine if you are breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using \nmachines if you experience signs of hypoglycaemia. Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low \nblood sugar. Please consult your doctor for further information on this topic. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Victoza \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially \n‘sodium free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Victoza \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \n• The starting dose is 0.6 mg once a day, for at least one week. \n• Your doctor will tell you when to increase it to 1.2 mg once a day. \n• Your doctor may tell you to further increase the dose to 1.8 mg once a day, if your blood \n\nglucose is not adequately controlled with a dose of 1.2 mg. \nDo not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to. \n \nVictoza is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). Do not inject it into a vein or muscle. \nThe best places to give yourself the injection are the front of your thighs, the front of your waist \n(abdomen), or your upper arm. \n \nYou can give yourself the injection at any time of the day, regardless of meals. When you have found \nthe most convenient time of the day it is preferred that you inject Victoza around the same time of the \nday. \n \nBefore you use the pen for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it. \nDetailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet. \n \nIf you use more Victoza than you should \nIf you use more Victoza than you should, talk to your doctor straight away. You may need medical \ntreatment. You may experience nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. \n \nIf you forget to use Victoza \nIf you forget a dose, use Victoza as soon as you remember. \nHowever, if it is more than 12 hours since you should have used Victoza, skip the missed dose. Then \ntake your next dose as usual the following day. \nDo not take an extra dose or increase the dose on the following day to make up for the missed dose. \n \nIf you stop using Victoza \nDo not stop using Victoza without talking to your doctor. If you stop using it, your blood sugar levels \nmay increase. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The warning signs of low blood sugar may come on \n\nsuddenly and can include: cold sweat, cool pale skin, headache, fast heartbeat, feeling sick, \nfeeling very hungry, changes in vision, feeling sleepy, feeling weak, nervous, anxious, \nconfused, difficulty concentrating, shaking (tremor). Your doctor will tell you how to treat low \nblood sugar and what to do if you notice these warning signs. This is more likely to happen if \nyou also take a sulfonylurea or insulin. Your doctor may reduce your dose of these medicines \nbefore you start using Victoza. \n\n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n• A severe form of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) with additional symptoms such as \n\nbreathing problems, swelling of throat and face, fast heartbeat, etc. If you experience these \nsymptoms you should seek immediate medical help and inform your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n• Bowel obstruction. A severe form of constipation with additional symptoms such as stomach \nache, bloating, vomiting etc. \n\n \nVery rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people \n• Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Pancreatitis can be a serious, potentially \n\nlife-threatening medical condition. Stop taking Victoza and contact a doctor immediately if you \nnotice any of the following serious side effects: \n\n \n Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your \n\nback, as well as nausea and vomiting, as it could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas \n(pancreatitis). \n\n \nOther side effects \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Nausea (feeling sick). This usually goes away over time. \n• Diarrhoea. This usually goes away over time. \n \nCommon \n• Vomiting. \n \nWhen initiating treatment with Victoza, you may in some cases experience loss of fluids/dehydration, \ne.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea.

You can select \ndoses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. \nThe pen is designed to be used with NovoFine or \nNovoTwist disposable injection needles up to a length of \n8 mm and as thin as 32G (0.25/0.23 mm).  \n\n \n\nPrepare your pen \n \nCheck the name and coloured label of your pen to make \nsure that it contains liraglutide. Using the wrong medicine \ncould cause severe harm. \n \nPull off the pen cap. \n\n \n\nPull off the paper tab from a new disposable needle. \nScrew the needle straight and tightly onto your pen. \n\n \n\nPull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. \n\n \n\nPull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. \n\n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. \n\n Be careful not to bend or damage the needle. \n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the \n\nneedle. \n\nCaring for your pen \n• Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \n• Keep your pen away from dust, dirt and all kinds of liquids. \n• Clean the pen with a cloth moistened with a mild detergent. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n• Do not try to wash, soak or lubricate it – this can harm the pen. \n\n Important information \n• Do not share your pen or needles with anyone else. \n• Keep your pen out of the reach of others, especially children. \n\nWith each new pen, check the flow \n \nCheck the flow before your first injection with each \nnew pen. If your pen is already in use, go to ‘Select \nyour dose’, step H. \n \nTurn the dose selector until the flow check symbol lines \nup with the pointer. \n\n \n\nHold the pen with the needle pointing up. Tap the \ncartridge gently with your finger a few times. This will \nmake any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n\n \n\nKeep the needle pointing up and press the dose button \nuntil 0 mg lines up with the pointer. \n \nA drop of liraglutide should appear at the needle tip. If no \ndrop appears, repeat steps E to G up to four times. \n \nIf there is still no drop of liraglutide, change the needle \nand repeat steps E to G once more. \n \nDo not use the pen if a drop of liraglutide still does not \nappear. This indicates the pen is defective and you must \nuse a new one.  \n\n If you have dropped your pen against a hard surface or suspect that something is wrong with it, \nalways put on a new disposable needle and check the flow before you inject. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nSelect your dose \n \nAlways check that the pointer lines up with 0 mg. \n \nTurn the dose selector until your needed dose lines up \nwith the pointer (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg). \n \nIf you selected a wrong dose by mistake, simply change it \nby turning the dose selector backwards or forwards until \nthe right dose lines up with the pointer. \n \nBe careful not to press the dose button when turning the \ndose selector backwards, as liraglutide may come out. \n \nIf the dose selector stops before your needed dose lines up \nwith the pointer, there is not enough liraglutide left for a \nfull dose. Then you can either: \n \nSplit your dose into two injections: \nTurn the dose selector in either direction until 0.6 mg or \n1.2 mg lines up with the pointer. Inject the dose. Then \nprepare a new pen for injection and inject the remaining \nnumber of mg to complete your dose. \n \nYou may only split your dose between your current pen \nand a new pen if trained or advised by your healthcare \nprofessional. Use a calculator to plan the doses. If you \nsplit the dose wrong, you may inject too much or too little \nliraglutide. \n \nInject the full dose with a new pen: \nIf the dose selector stops before 0.6 mg lines up with the \npointer, prepare a new pen and inject the full dose with \nthe new pen. \n\n \n\n Do not try to select other doses than 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The numbers in the display \nmust line up precisely with the pointer to ensure that you get the correct dose. \nThe dose selector clicks when you turn it. Do not use these clicks to select your dose. \nDo not use the cartridge scale to measure how much liraglutide to inject – it is not accurate \nenough. \n\nInject your dose \n \nInsert the needle into your skin using the injection \ntechnique shown by your doctor or nurse. Then follow \nthe instructions below: \n \nPress the dose button to inject until 0 mg lines up with the \npointer. Be careful not to touch the display with your \nother fingers or press the dose selector sideways when \nyou inject. This is because it may block the injection. \nKeep the dose button pressed down and leave the needle \nunder the skin for at least 6 seconds. This is to make sure \nthat you get your full dose.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nPull out the needle. \nAfter that, you may see a drop liraglutide at the needle \ntip. \nThis is normal and does not affect your dose. \n\n \n\nGuide the needle tip into the outer needle cap without \ntouching the needle or the outer needle cap. \n\n \n\nWhen the needle is covered, carefully push the outer \nneedle cap completely on. Then unscrew the needle. \nDispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on. \n \nWhen the pen is empty, carefully dispose of it without a \nneedle attached. Please dispose of the pen and needle in \naccordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without a needle attached. \n This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and \n\ninaccurate dosing. \n Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to prevent needle injury and \n\ncross-infection. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnnex IV \n \n\nScientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing \nauthorisation \n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for liraglutide, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows:  \n \nData from clinical trials showed that liraglutide is associated with delayed gastric emptying. In the \nLEADER study, delayed gastric emptying was reported three times more frequently in the liraglutide \ngroup compared to the placebo group. As there is sufficient evidence to conclude on a causal \nrelationship between delayed gastric emptying and liraglutide, delayed gastric emptying should be \nincluded as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency allocation of ‘uncommon’ and in \nsection 4 of the Package Leaflet. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for liraglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing liraglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied. \n \n \n\n\n\tANNEX ISUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
