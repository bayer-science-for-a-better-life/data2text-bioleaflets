NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCholestagel 625 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 625 mg colesevelam (as hydrochloride). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \nOff-white, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets imprinted with \u201cC625\u201d on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCholestagel co-administered with a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase \ninhibitor (statin) is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to provide an additive reduction in \nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in adult patients with primary \nhypercholesterolaemia who are not adequately controlled with a statin alone. \n \nCholestagel as monotherapy is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for reduction of elevated \ntotal-cholesterol and LDL-C in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia, in whom a statin is \nconsidered inappropriate or is not well-tolerated. \n \nCholestagel can also be used in combination with ezetimibe, with or without a statin, in adult patients \nwith primary hypercholesterolaemia, including patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of Cholestagel for combination with a statin with or without ezetimibe is 4 to \n6 tablets per day. The maximum recommended dose is 6 tablets per day taken as 3 tablets twice per \nday with meals or 6 tablets taken once per day with a meal. Clinical trials have shown that Cholestagel \nand statins can be co-administered or dosed apart, and that Cholestagel and ezetimibe can be co-\nadministered or dosed apart. \n \nMonotherapy \nThe recommended starting dose of Cholestagel is 6 tablets per day taken as 3 tablets twice per day \nwith meals or 6 tablets once per day with a meal. The maximum recommended dose is 7 tablets per \nday. \n \nDuring therapy, the cholesterol-lowering diet should be continued, and serum total-C, LDL-C and \ntriglyceride levels should be determined periodically during treatment to confirm favourable initial and \nadequate long-term responses. \n \nWhen a drug interaction cannot be excluded with a concomitant medicinal product for which minor \nvariations in the therapeutic level would be clinically important, or where no clinical data are available \non co-administration, Cholestagel should be administered at least four hours before or at least four \n\n\n\n3 \n\nhours after the concomitant medication in order to minimize the risk of reduced absorption of the \nconcomitant medication (see section 4.5).  \n \nElderly population \nThere is no need for dose adjustment when Cholestagel is administered to elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Cholestagel in children aged 0 to 17 years have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade.  \n \nMethod of administration \nCholestagel tablets should be taken orally with a meal and liquid.  \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole and not broken, crushed or chewed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 Bowel or biliary obstruction \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nSecondary causes of hypercholesterolaemia \nPrior to initiating therapy with Cholestagel, if secondary causes of hypercholesterolaemia (i.e., poorly \ncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinaemias, obstructive liver \ndisease) are considered, these should be diagnosed and properly treated. \n \nInteraction with ciclosporin \nFor patients on ciclosporin starting or stopping Cholestagel or patients on Cholestagel with a need to \nstart ciclosporin: Cholestagel reduces the bioavailability of ciclosporin (see also section 4.5).  Patients \nstarting on ciclosporin already taking Cholestagel should have their ciclosporin blood concentrations \nmonitored as normal and their dose adjusted as normal. Patients starting on Cholestagel already taking \nciclosporin should have their blood concentrations monitored prior to combination therapy and \nfrequently monitored immediately starting co-therapy with the ciclosporin dose adjusted accordingly. \nIt should be noted that stopping Cholestagel therapy will result in increased ciclosporin blood \nconcentrations. Therefore, patients taking both ciclosporin and Cholestagel should have their blood \nconcentrations monitored prior to and frequently after when Cholestagel therapy is stopped with their \nciclosporin dose adjusted accordingly. \n \nEffects on triglyceride levels \nCaution should be exercised when treating patients with triglyceride levels greater than 3.4 mmol/L \ndue to the triglyceride increasing effect with Cholestagel. Safety and efficacy are not established for \npatients with triglyceride levels greater than 3.4 mmol/L, since such patients were excluded from the \nclinical studies. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Cholestagel in patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe \ngastrointestinal motility disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, liver failure or major gastrointestinal \ntract surgery have not been established. Consequently, caution should be exercised when Cholestagel \nis used in patients with these disorders. \n \nConstipation \nCholestagel can induce or worsen present constipation. The risk of constipation should especially be \nconsidered in patients with coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAnticoagulants \nAnticoagulant therapy should be monitored closely in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since \nbile acid sequestrants, like Cholestagel, have been shown to reduce absorption of vitamin K and therefore \ninterfere with warfarin\u2019s anticoagulant effect (see also section 4.5). \n \nOral contraceptives \nCholestagel can affect the bioavailability of the oral contraceptive pill when administered \nsimultaneously. It is important to ensure that Cholestagel is administered at least 4 hours after the oral \ncontraceptive pill to minimise the risk of any interaction (see also section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn general \nCholestagel may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. Therefore when a drug \ninteraction cannot be excluded with a concomitant medicinal product for which minor variations in the \ntherapeutic level would be clinically important, Cholestagel should be administered at least four hours \nbefore or at least four hours after the concomitant medication to minimize the risk of reduced \nabsorption of the concomitant medication. For concomitant medications which require administration \nvia divided doses, it should be noted that the required dose of Cholestagel can be taken once a day. \n \nWhen administering medicinal products for which alterations in blood levels could have a clinically \nsignificant effect on safety or efficacy, physicians should consider monitoring serum levels or effects.  \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nIn interaction studies in healthy volunteers, Cholestagel had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, \nmetoprolol, quinidine, valproic acid, and warfarin. Cholestagel decreased the Cmax and AUC of \nsustained-release verapamil by approximately 31% and 11%, respectively. Since there is a high degree of \nvariability in the bioavailability of verapamil, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. \n \nCo-administration of colesevelam and olmesartan decreases the exposure of olmesartan.  Olmesartan \nshould be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. \n \nThere have been very rare reports of reduced phenytoin levels in patients who have received Cholestagel \nadministered with phenytoin. \n \nAnticoagulant therapy \nAnticoagulant therapy should be monitored closely in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, \nsince bile acid sequestrants, like Cholestagel, have been shown to reduce absorption of vitamin K and \ntherefore interfere with warfarin's anticoagulant effect.  Specific clinical interaction studies with \ncolesevelam and vitamin K have not been performed. \n \nLevothyroxine \nIn an interaction study in healthy volunteers, Cholestagel reduced the AUC and Cmax of levothyroxine \nwhen administered either concomitantly or after 1 hour. No interaction was observed when \nCholestagel was administered at least four hours after levothyroxine. \n \nOral contraceptive pill \nIn an interaction study in healthy volunteers, Cholestagel reduced the Cmax  of norethindrone as well as \nthe AUC and Cmax of ethinylestradiol when administered simultaneously with the oral contraceptive \npill. This interaction was also observed when Cholestagel was administered one hour after the oral \ncontraceptive pill. However no interaction was observed when Cholestagel was administered four \nhours after the oral contraceptive pill. \n \nCiclosporin \nIn an interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of Cholestagel and ciclosporin \nsignificantly reduced the AUC0-inf and Cmax of ciclosporin by 34% by 44%, respectively. Therefore \n\n\n\n5 \n\nadvice is given to closely monitor ciclosporin blood concentrations (see also section 4.4). In addition, \nbased on theoretical grounds Cholestagel should be administered at least 4 hours after ciclosporin in \norder to further minimise the risks related to the concomitant administration of ciclosporin and \nCholestagel. Furthermore, Cholestagel should always be administered at the same times consistently \nsince the timing of intake of Cholestagel and ciclosporin could theoretically influence the degree of \nreduced bioavailability of ciclosporin. \n \nStatins \nWhen Cholestagel was co-administered with statins in clinical studies, an expected add-on LDL-C \nlowering effect was observed, and no unexpected effects were observed. Cholestagel had no effect on \nthe bioavailability of lovastatin in an interaction study. \n \nAntidiabetic agents \nCo-administration of colesevelam and metformin extended-release (ER) tablets increases the exposure \nof metformin. Patients receiving concomitant metformin ER and colesevelam should be monitored for \nclinical response as is usual for the use of anti-diabetes drugs.  \n \nColesevelam binds to glimepiride and reduces glimepiride absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. \nNo interaction was observed when glimepiride was taken at least 4 hours before colesevelam. \nTherefore glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. \n \nCo-administration of colesevelam and glipizide decreases the exposure of glipizide. Glipizide should \nbe administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. \n \nCo-administration of Cholestagel and glyburide (also known as glibenclamide) caused a decrease in \nthe AUC0-inf and Cmax of glyburide by 32% and 47%, respectively. No interaction was observed when \nCholestagel was administered four hours after glyburide. \n \nCo-administration of Cholestagel and repaglinide had no effect on the AUC and caused a 19% \nreduction in the Cmax of repaglinide, the clinical significance of which is unknown. No interaction was \nobserved when Cholestagel was administered one hour after repaglinide. \n \nNo interaction was observed when Cholestagel and pioglitazone were administered simultaneously in \nhealthy volunteers \n \nUrsodeoxycholic acid \nCholestagel predominantly binds hydrophobic bile acids. In a clinical study Cholestagel did not affect \nthe faecal excretion of endogenous (hydrophilic) ursodeoxycholic acid. However, formal interaction \nstudies with ursodeoxycholic acid have not been performed. As noted in general, when a drug \ninteraction cannot be excluded with a concomitant medicinal product, Cholestagel should be \nadministered at least four hours before or at least four hours after the concomitant medication to \nminimise the risk of reduced absorption of the concomitant medication. Monitoring of the clinical \neffects of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid should be considered. \n \nOther forms of interaction \nCholestagel did not induce any clinically significant reduction in the absorption of vitamins A, D, E or \nK during clinical studies of up to one year. However, caution should be exercised when treating \npatients with a susceptibility to vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, such as patients with \nmalabsorption. In these patients, monitoring vitamin A, D and E levels and assessing vitamin K status \nthrough the measurement of coagulation parameters is recommended and the vitamins should be \nsupplemented if necessary. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo clinical data are available on the use of Cholestagel in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, \n\n\n\n6 \n\nparturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nto pregnant women. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe safety of Cholestagel has not been established in breast-feeding women. Caution should be \nexercised when prescribing to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of Cholestagel on fertility in humans. A study conducted in rats did not \nresult in any differences in reproductive parameters between the groups that might imply reproductive \neffects attributable to colesevelam. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCholestagel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently occurring adverse reactions are flatulence and constipation, found within the \ngastrointestinal disorders system organ class. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn controlled clinical studies involving approximately 1400 patients and during post-approval use, the \nfollowing adverse reactions were reported in patients given Cholestagel. \n \nThe reporting rate is classified as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).  \n \n\nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Headache \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: Flatulence*, constipation* \nCommon: Vomiting, diarrhoea*, dyspepsia*, abdominal pain, \nabnormal stools, nausea, abdominal distension \nUncommon: Dysphagia \nVery rare: Pancreatitis \nNot known: Intestinal obstruction*,** \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: Myalgia \nInvestigations \nCommon: Serum triglycerides increased \nUncommon :Serum transaminases increased \n\n* see section below for further information \n** adverse reactions from post-marketing experience \n \nDescription of selected adverse events \nThe background incidence of flatulence and diarrhoea were higher in patients receiving placebo in the \nsame controlled clinical studies. Only constipation and dyspepsia were reported by a higher percentage \namong those receiving Cholestagel, compared with placebo. \n \nThe incidence of intestinal obstruction is likely to be increased among patients with a history of bowel \nobstruction or removal. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCholestagel in combination with statins and in combination with ezetimibe was well tolerated and the \nadverse reactions observed were consistent with the known safety profile of statins or ezetimibe alone.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSince Cholestagel is not absorbed, the risk of systemic toxicity is low. Gastrointestinal symptoms could \noccur. Doses in excess of the maximum recommended dose (4.5 g per day (7 tablets)) have not been \ntested. \n \nShould overdosage occur, however, the chief potential harm would be obstruction of the gastrointestinal \ntract. The location of such potential obstruction, the degree of obstruction and the presence or absence of \nnormal gut motility would determine treatment. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Lipid modifying agent, bile acid sequestrants, ATC code: C10A C 04 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action for the activity of colesevelam, the active substance in Cholestagel, has been \nevaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies. These studies have demonstrated that colesevelam \nbinds bile acids, including glycocholic acid, the major bile acid in humans. Cholesterol is the sole \nprecursor of bile acids. During normal digestion, bile acids are secreted into the intestine. A major \nportion of bile acids is then absorbed from the intestinal tract and returned to the liver via the \nenterohepatic circulation. \n \nColesevelam is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding \ntheir reabsorption. The LDL-C lowering mechanism of bile acid sequestrants has been previously \nestablished as follows: As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol \n7-\u03b1-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This \ncauses an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effects of increasing \ntranscription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A \n(HMG-CoA) reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors. A \nconcomitant increase in very low density lipoprotein synthesis can occur. These compensatory effects \nresult in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. \n \nIn a 6-month dose-response study in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia receiving 3.8 or \n4.5 g Cholestagel daily, a 15 to 18% decrease in LDL-C levels was observed, which was evident \nwithin 2 weeks of administration. In addition, Total-C decreased 7 to 10%, HDL-C increased 3% and \ntriglycerides increased 9 to 10%.  Apo B decreased by 12%. In comparison, in patients given placebo, \nLDL-C, Total-C, HDL-C and Apo-B were unchanged, while triglycerides increased 5%. Studies \nexamining administration of Cholestagel as a single dose with breakfast, a single dose with dinner, or \nas divided doses with breakfast and dinner did not show significant differences in LDL-C reduction \nfor different dosing schedules. However, in one study triglycerides tended to increase more when \nCholestagel was given as a single dose with breakfast.  \n \nIn a 6 week study 129 patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia were randomised to fenofibrate 160 mg \nplus 3.8 g Cholestagel or fenofibrate alone. The fenofibrate plus Cholestagel group (64 patients) \ndemonstrated a 10% reduction on LDL-C levels versus 2% increase for the fenofibrate group \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n(65 patients). Reductions were also seen for non-HDL-C, Total-C and Apo B. A small 5%, \nnon-significant increase in triglycerides was noted. The effects of combination of fenofibrate and \nCholestagel on the risks of myopathy or hepatotoxicity are not known. \n \nMulti-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 487 patients demonstrated an \nadditive reduction of 8 to 16% in LDL-C when 2.3 to 3.8 g Cholestagel and a statin (atorvastatin, \nlovastatin or simvastatin) were administered at the same time. \n \nThe effect of 3.8 g Cholestagel plus 10 mg ezetimibe versus 10 mg ezetimibe alone on LDL-C levels \nwas assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in \n86 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia over a 6-week treatment period.  The combination of \nezetimibe 10 mg and Cholestagel 3.8 g daily therapy in the absence of a statin resulted in a significant \ncombined effect for LDL-C lowering by 32% demonstrating an additional effect of 11% LDL-C \nlowering with Cholestagel and ezetimibe compared to ezetimibe alone. \n \nThe addition of Cholestagel 3.8 g daily to maximally-tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy was \nassessed in a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 86 patients with \nfamilial hypercholesterolaemia. A total of 85% of the patients were on either atorvastatin (50% of \nwhom received 80 mg dose) or rosuvastatin (72% of whom received 40 mg dose). Cholestagel resulted \nin a statistically significant LDL-C reduction of 11% and 11% at 6 and 12 weeks vs an increase of 7% \nand 1% in the placebo group; mean baseline levels were 3.75 mmol/L and 3.86 mmol/L, respectively.  \nTriglycerides in the Cholestagel group increased by 19% and 13% at 6 and 12 weeks vs an increase of \n6% and 13% in the placebo group, but the increases were not significantly different. HDL-C and \nhsCRP levels were also not significantly different compared to placebo at 12 weeks.  \n \nPaediatric population \nIn the paediatric population, the safety and efficacy of 1.9 or 3.8 g/day Cholestagel was assessed in an \n8 week multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 194 boys and \npostmenarchal girls, aged 10-17 years, with heterozygous FH on a stable dose of statins (47 patients, \n24%) or treatment-na\u00efve to lipid-lowering therapy (147 patients, 76%).  For all patients, Cholestagel \nresulted in a statistically significant LDL-C reduction of 11% at 3.8 g/day and 4% at 1.9 g/day, versus \na 3% increase in the placebo group.  For statin-na\u00efve patients on monotherapy, Cholestagel resulted in \na statistically significant LDL-C reduction of 12% at 3.8 g/day and 7% at 1.9 g/day, versus a 1% \nreduction in the placebo group (see section 4.2). There were no significant effects on growth, sexual \nmaturation, fat-soluble vitamin levels or clotting factors, and the adverse reaction profile for \nCholestagel was comparable to that seen with placebo. \n \nCholestagel has not been compared directly to other bile acid sequestrants in clinical trials. \n \nSo far, no studies have been conducted that directly demonstrate whether treatment with Cholestagel \nas monotherapy or combination therapy has any effect on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCholestagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take Cholestagel \n3. How to take Cholestagel \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Cholestagel \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cholestagel is and what it is used for \n \nCholestagel contains the active substance colesevelam (as hydrochloride). Taking Cholestagel helps to \nlower the level of cholesterol in your blood. Your doctor should only give you Cholestagel if a diet \nlow in fat and cholesterol did not work well enough on its own. \n \nCholestagel works in your intestinal system by binding bile acids produced by your liver and carrying \nthe bile acids out of your body with your faeces. This prevents your body from recycling the bile acids \nfrom your intestines in the usual way. Without the recycling process, your liver has to make additional \nbile acids. Your liver uses cholesterol from your blood to do this, which lowers the level of cholesterol \nin your blood. \n \nCholestagel is prescribed to treat a condition known as primary hypercholesterolaemia (when \ncholesterol in the blood is elevated) in adults. \n- Cholestagel may be prescribed on its own in addition to a diet low in fat and cholesterol when \n\ntreatment with a statin (a class of cholesterol-lowering medicines that work in the liver) is \ninappropriate or not well tolerated.  \n\n- Cholestagel may be used together with a statin and the diet low in fat and cholesterol when \npatients are not appropriately controlled by the statin on its own.  \n\n- Cholestagel may also be used together with ezetimibe (a cholesterol-lowering medicine that works \nby reducing cholesterol absorption from the gut), with or without a statin. \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you take Cholestagel \n \nDo not take Cholestagel: \n- if you are allergic to colesevelam or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you have a blockage in your intestines or bile ducts (tubes that carry bile) \n \nIf you are prescribed Cholestagel and any other medicine together you must also read the patient \ninformation leaflet that comes with that particular medicine before you start to take your medicine.  \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cholestagel \n- if your triglyceride levels (a blood fat) are greater than 3.4 mmol/L \n- if you have difficulty in swallowing, or have a major stomach or intestinal disorder \n- if you suffer from constipation, as Cholestagel may induce or worsen this condition. This is \n\nespecially important for patients with coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. \n \nIf you think any of these apply to you, you should inform your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nCholestagel. \n \nBefore starting therapy with Cholestagel, your physician should make sure that certain conditions do \nnot contribute to your elevated cholesterol levels. These could include poorly controlled diabetes, \nuntreated hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone for which no treatment is being given \ncurrently), proteins in urine (nephrotic syndrome), altered protein levels in the blood \n(dysproteinaemias), and blockage of the bile transport to your gall bladder (obstructive liver disease). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore, \nCholestagel is not recommended for use in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Cholestagel \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nIf your doctor suspects that Cholestagel may have an effect on the absorption of the other medication, \nyou may be advised to take Cholestagel at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after taking the other \nmedication. If you need to take other medicines more than once a day, remember that your Cholestagel \ntablets can be taken once a day. \n \nCholestagel may affect the way in which the following medicines work: \n\n\u2022 Anticoagulant therapy (medicines, such as warfarin, used to thin blood).  If you are taking \nanticoagulant therapy you should consult with your physician to closely monitor \nanticoagulation levels, as Cholestagel may affect the absorption of vitamin K and therefore \ninterfere with the activity of warfarin. \n\n\u2022 Thyroid replacement therapy (medicines, such as thyroxine or levothyroxine, used to treat low \nthyroid hormone levels) \n\n\u2022 Oral contraceptives (medicines to prevent pregnancy) \nIt is important you take Cholestagel at least 4 hours after you take the oral contraceptive to \nensure that the effectiveness of the contraceptive is not affected. \n\n\u2022 Verapamil or olmesartan (medicines used to treat high blood pressure). It is important that you \ntake olmesartan at least 4 hours before you take Cholestagel. \n\n\u2022 Antidiabetic medications (medicines used to treat diabetes, such as metformin \nextended-release (ER) tablets, glimepiride, glipizide, pioglitazone, repaglinide or glyburide). \nIf you are taking medicines for diabetes, you should consult with your physician so that you \ncan be closely monitored. It is important that you take glimepiride and glipizide at least 4 \nhours before you take Cholestagel. \n\n\u2022 Anti-epileptic medicines (medicines, such as phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy).  \n\u2022 Ciclosporin (a medicine used to suppress the immune system).  \n\u2022 Ursodeoxycholic acid (a medicine used to dissolve gallstones or treat specific chronic liver \n\ndiseases). \n\nIf you are going to take Cholestagel and one of these medicines, your doctor may want to do tests to \nmake sure that Cholestagel does not interfere with these medicines.  \n \nAdditionally, if you have any condition that could cause you to have a deficiency of vitamins A, D, E \nor K, your doctor may want to check your vitamin levels periodically while you are taking \nCholestagel. If necessary, your doctor may advise you to take vitamin supplements. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIf you are prescribed Cholestagel and a statin together it is important that you tell your doctor if you \nare pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant because statins must not be used during \npregnancy; the patient information leaflet that comes with that particular statin should be consulted. \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Your doctor may stop your medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to drive or operate machines is not affected by taking Cholestagel tablets. \n \n \n3. How to take Cholestagel \n \nBefore starting therapy with Cholestagel, you should be advised to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet \nand you should continue this diet during treatment. \n \nAlways take Cholestagel exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are unsure. As described in Section 2, if you will be taking Cholestagel along with \nanother medicine it is possible that your doctor will advise you to take Cholestagel at least 4 hours \nbefore or at least 4 hours after taking the other medicine. \nIf you take a medicine called either Neoral\u00ae or ciclosporin, please ensure to take it with Cholestagel in \na consistent pattern over the day; either always together or always separate for a set number of hours. \n \nYou should take your Cholestagel tablets with food and liquid. The tablets should be swallowed \nwhole. Do not break, crush or chew the tablets. \n \nCombination therapy: \nThe recommended dose for Cholestagel, when used with a statin or ezetimibe or both together, is 4 to \n6 tablets a day by mouth. Your doctor may tell you to take the Cholestagel dose either once a day or \ntwice a day; in either case Cholestagel should be taken with a meal. The dosing of the statin and the \nezetimibe should follow the instructions for that particular medicine. The medicines may be taken at \nthe same time or at separate times according to what your doctor has prescribed. \n \nMonotherapy: \nThe recommended dose for Cholestagel is 3 tablets taken twice a day with meals or 6 tablets a day \nwith a meal. Your doctor may increase your dose to 7 tablets per day. \n \nIf you take more Cholestagel than you should \nPlease contact your doctor. Constipation or bloating could occur. \n \nIf you forget to take Cholestagel \nYou may take your dose with a later meal, but never take in one day more than the total number of \ntablets that your doctor has prescribed to you in a single day. \n \nIf you stop taking Cholestagel \nYour cholesterol may increase to the level it was before treatment was started. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

during treatment. always take cholestagel exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure. as described in section 2, if you will be taking cholestagel along with another medicine it is possible that your doctor will advise you to take cholestagel at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after taking the other medicine. if you take a medicine called either neoral\u00ae or ciclosporin, please ensure to take it with cholestagel in a consistent pattern over the day; either always together or always separate for a set number of hours. you should take your cholestagel tablets with food and liquid. the tablets should be swallowed whole. do not break, crush or chew the tablets. combination therapy: the recommended dose for cholestagel, when used with a statin or ezetimibe or both together, is 4 to 6 tablets a day by mouth. your doctor may tell you to take the cholestagel dose either once a day or twice a day; in either case cholestagel should be taken with a meal. the dosing of the statin and the ezetimibe should follow the instructions for that particular medicine. the medicines may be taken at the same time or at separate times according to what your doctor has prescribed. monotherapy: the recommended dose for cholestagel is 3 tablets taken twice a day with meals or 6 tablets a day with a meal. your doctor may increase your dose to 7 tablets per day. if you take more cholestagel than you should please contact your doctor. constipation or bloating could occur. if you forget to take cholestagel you may take your dose with a later meal, but never take in one day more than the total number of tablets that your doctor has prescribed to you in a single day. if you stop taking cholestagel your cholesterol may increase to the level it was before treatment was started. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
