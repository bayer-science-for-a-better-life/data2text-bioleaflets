NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAUBAGIO 14 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 14 mg of teriflunomide. \n \nExcipient with known effect: each tablet contains 72 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nPale blue to pastel blue, pentagonal film-coated tablets with imprint on one side (\u201814\u2019) and engraved with a \ncorporate logo on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAUBAGIO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) \n(please refer to section 5.1 for important information on the population for which efficacy has been \nestablished). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of multiple \nsclerosis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of teriflunomide is 14 mg once daily.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nAUBAGIO should be used with caution in patients aged 65 years and over due to insufficient data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment not \nundergoing dialysis. \nPatients with severe renal impairment undergoing dialysis were not evaluated. Teriflunomide is \ncontraindicated in this population (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Teriflunomide is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of teriflunomide in children aged from 10 to less than 18 years has not yet been \nestablished. There is no relevant use of teriflunomide in children aged from birth to less than 10 years for the \ntreatment of multiple sclerosis. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe film-coated tablets are for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. AUBAGIO \ncan be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n \nPregnant women, or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception during \ntreatment with teriflunomide and thereafter as long as its plasma levels are above 0.02 mg/l (see section 4.6). \nPregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nBreast-feeding women (see section 4.6). \n \nPatients with severe immunodeficiency states, e.g. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). \n \nPatients with significantly impaired bone marrow function or significant anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia. \n \nPatients with severe active infection until resolution (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment undergoing dialysis, because insufficient clinical experience is \navailable in this patient group. \n \nPatients with severe hypoproteinaemia, e.g. in nephrotic syndrome. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring \n \nBefore treatment \nBefore starting treatment with teriflunomide the following should be assessed:  \n\uf0b7 Blood pressure \n\uf0b7 Alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) \n\uf0b7 Complete blood cell count including differential white blood cell and platelet count. \n \nDuring treatment \nDuring treatment with teriflunomide the following should be monitored:  \n\uf0b7 Blood pressure \n\no Check periodically \n\uf0b7 Alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) \n\no Liver enzymes should be assessed every two weeks during the first 6 months of treatment, \nand every 8 weeks thereafter or as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms such as \nunexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark \nurine. For ALT (SGPT) elevations between 2- and 3-fold the upper limit of normal, \nmonitoring must be performed weekly. \n\n\uf0b7 Complete blood cell counts should be performed based on clinical signs and symptoms (e.g. \ninfections) during treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nAccelerated elimination procedure \n \nTeriflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. Without an accelerated elimination procedure, it takes \nan average of 8 months to reach plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/l, although due to individual \nvariation in substance clearance it may take up to 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure can be used \nat any time after discontinuation of teriflunomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.2 for procedural details). \n \nHepatic effects \n \nElevations of liver enzymes have been observed in patients receiving teriflunomide (see section 4.8). These \nelevations occurred mostly within the first 6 months of treatment. \nTeriflunomide therapy should be discontinued if liver injury is suspected; consider discontinuing \nteriflunomide therapy if elevated liver enzymes (greater than 3-fold ULN) are confirmed.  \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver disease and/or who consume substantial quantities of alcohol may be at \nincreased risk of developing elevated liver enzymes when taking teriflunomide and should be closely \nmonitored for signals of liver disease.  \n \nHypoproteinaemia \n \nSince teriflunomide is highly protein bound and as the binding is dependent upon the concentrations of \nalbumin, unbound plasma teriflunomide concentrations are expected to be increased in patients with \nhypoproteinaemia, e.g. in nephrotic syndrome. Teriflunomide should not be used in patients with conditions \nof severe hypoproteinaemia. \n \nBlood pressure  \n \nElevation of blood pressure may occur during treatment with teriflunomide (see section 4.8). Blood pressure \nmust be checked before the start of teriflunomide treatment and periodically thereafter. Blood pressure \nelevation should be appropriately managed before and during treatment with teriflunomide. \n \nInfections \n \nInitiation of treatment with teriflunomide should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until \nresolution.  \nIn placebo-controlled studies, no increase in serious infections was observed with teriflunomide (see section \n4.8). However, based on the immunomodulatory effect of teriflunomide, if a patient develops a serious \ninfection, suspending treatment with AUBAGIO should be considered and the benefits and risks should be \nreassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Due to the prolonged half-life, accelerated elimination with \ncholestyramine or charcoal may be considered. \nPatients receiving AUBAGIO should be instructed to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients \nwith active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment with AUBAGIO until the infection(s) is \nresolved.  \nThe safety of teriflunomide in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown, as tuberculosis \nscreening was not systematically performed in clinical studies. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis \nscreening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with AUBAGIO. \n \nRespiratory reactions \n \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) has been reported with teriflunomide in the postmarketing setting.  \nILD and worsening of pre-existing ILD have been reported during treatment with leflunomide, the parent \ncompound of teriflunomide. The risk is increased in patients who had a history of ILD when treated with \nleflunomide.  \n \nILD may occur acutely at any time during therapy with a variable clinical presentation.  \nILD may be fatal. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as persistent cough and dyspnoea, \nmay be a reason for discontinuation of the therapy and for further investigation, as appropriate. If \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product is necessary, initiation of an accelerated elimination procedure \nshould be considered. \n \nHaematological effects \n \nA mean decrease less than 15% from baseline affecting white blood cell count has been observed (see \nsection 4.8). As a precaution, a recent complete blood cell count, including differential white blood cell \ncount and platelets, should be available before the initiation of treatment with AUBAGIO and the complete \nblood cell count should be assessed during AUBAGIO therapy as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms \n(e.g., infections). \n \nIn patients with pre-existing anaemia, leucopenia, and /or thrombocytopenia as well as in patients with \nimpaired bone marrow function or those at risk of bone marrow suppression, the risk of haematological \ndisorders is increased. If such effects occur, the accelerated elimination procedure (see above) to reduce \nplasma levels of teriflunomide should be considered. \nIn cases of severe haematological reactions, including pancytopenia, AUBAGIO and any concomitant \nmyelosuppressive treatment must be discontinued and a teriflunomide accelerated elimination procedure \nshould be considered. \n \nSkin reactions \n \nCases of severe skin reactions have been reported postmarketing (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and \ntoxic epidermal necrolysis). \n \nIn patients treated with leflunomide, the parent compound, very rare cases of Drug Reaction with \nEosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported.  \n \nIn case of ulcerative stomatitis, teriflunomide administration should be discontinued. If skin and /or mucosal \nreactions are observed which raise the suspicion of severe generalised major skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis-Lyell\u2019s syndrome), teriflunomide and any other possibly associated \ntreatment must be discontinued, and an accelerated procedure initiated immediately. In such cases patients \nshould not be re-exposed to teriflunomide (see section 4.3). \n \nNew onset of psoriasis (including pustular psoriasis) and worsening of pre-existing psoriasis have been \nreported during the use of teriflunomide. Treatment withdrawal and initiation of an accelerated elimination \nprocedure may be considered taking into account patient\u2019s disease and medical history. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n \nCases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving AUBAGIO (see section 4.8). Most \npatients improved after discontinuation of AUBAGIO. However, there was a wide variability in final \noutcome, i.e. in some patients the neuropathy resolved and some patients had persistent symptoms. If a \npatient taking AUBAGIO develops a confirmed peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing AUBAGIO \ntherapy and performing the accelerated elimination procedure. \n \nVaccination \n \nTwo clinical studies have shown that vaccinations to inactivated neoantigen (first vaccination), or recall \nantigen (reexposure) were safe and effective during AUBAGIO treatment. The use of live attenuated \nvaccines may carry a risk of infections and should therefore be avoided. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nImmunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies \n \nAs leflunomide is the parent compound of teriflunomide, co-administration of teriflunomide with \nleflunomide is not recommended.  \nCo-administration with antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies used for treatment of MS has not \nbeen evaluated. Safety studies, in which teriflunomide was concomitantly administered with interferon beta \nor with glatiramer acetate for up to one year did not reveal any specific safety concerns, but a higher adverse \nreaction rate as compared to teriflunomide monotherapy was observed. The long term safety of these \ncombinations in the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not been established. \n \nSwitching to or from AUBAGIO \n \nBased on the clinical data related to concomitant administration of teriflunomide with interferon beta or with \nglatiramer acetate, no waiting period is required when initiating teriflunomide after interferon beta or \nglatiramer acetate or when starting interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, after teriflunomide. \n \nDue to the long half-life of natalizumab, concomitant exposure, and thus concomitant immune effects, could \noccur for up to 2-3 months following discontinuation of natalizumab if AUBAGIO was immediately started. \nTherefore, caution is required when switching patients from natalizumab to AUBAGIO. \n \nBased on the half-life of fingolimod, a 6-week interval without therapy is needed for clearance from the \ncirculation and a 1 to 2 month period is needed for lymphocytes to return to normal range following \ndiscontinuation of fingolimod. Starting AUBAGIO during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to \nfingolimod. This may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and caution is, therefore, indicated. \n \nIn MS patients, the median t1/2z was approximately 19 days after repeated doses of 14 mg. If a decision is \nmade to stop treatment with AUBAGIO, during the interval of 5 half-lives (approximately 3.5 months \nalthough may be longer in some patients), starting other therapies will result in concomitant exposure to \nAUBAGIO. This may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and caution is, therefore, indicated. \n \nLactose \n \nSince AUBAGIO tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicinal product. \n \nInterference with determination of ionised calcium levels \n \nThe measurement of ionised calcium levels might show falsely decreased values under treatment with \nleflunomide and/or teriflunomide (the active metabolite of leflunomide) depending on the type of ionised \ncalcium analyser used (e.g. blood gas analyser). Therefore, the plausibility of observed decreased ionised \ncalcium levels needs to be questioned in patients under treatment with leflunomide or teriflunomide. In case \nof doubtful measurements, it is recommended to determine the total albumin adjusted serum calcium \nconcentration.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions of other substances on teriflunomide \n \nThe primary biotransformation pathway for teriflunomide is hydrolysis, with oxidation being a minor \npathway. \n \nPotent cytochrome P450 (CYP) and transporter inducers \nCo-administration of repeated doses (600 mg once daily for 22 days) of rifampicin (a CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, \n2C19, 3A inducer), as well as an inducer of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer \nresistant protein [BCRP] with teriflunomide (70 mg single dose) resulted in an approximately 40% decrease \nin teriflunomide exposure. Rifampicin and other known potent CYP and transporter inducers such as \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and St John\u2019s Wort should be used with caution during the \ntreatment with teriflunomide. \n \nCholestyramine or activated charcoal \nIt is recommended that patients receiving teriflunomide are not treated with cholestyramine or activated \ncharcoal because this leads to a rapid and significant decrease in plasma concentration unless an accelerated \nelimination is desired. The mechanism is thought to be by interruption of enterohepatic recycling and/or \ngastrointestinal dialysis of teriflunomide. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions of teriflunomide on other substances \n \nEffect of teriflunomide on CYP2C8 substrate: repaglinide \nThere was an increase in mean repaglinide Cmax and AUC (1.7- and 2.4-fold, respectively), following \nrepeated doses of teriflunomide, suggesting that teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. Therefore, \nmedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8, such as repaglinide, paclitaxel, pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, \nshould be used with caution during treatment with teriflunomide. \n \nEffect of teriflunomide on oral contraceptives: 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel \nThere was an increase in mean ethinylestradiol Cmax and AUC0-24 (1.58- and 1.54-fold, respectively) and \nlevonorgestrel Cmax and AUC0-24 (1.33- and 1.41-fold, respectively) following repeated doses of \nteriflunomide. While this interaction of teriflunomide is not expected to adversely impact the efficacy of oral \ncontraceptives, it should be considered when selecting or adjusting oral contraceptive treatment used in \ncombination with teriflunomide.  \n \nEffect of teriflunomide on CYP1A2 substrate: caffeine \nRepeated doses of teriflunomide decreased mean Cmax and AUC of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) by 18% and \n55%, respectively, suggesting that teriflunomide may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. Therefore, \nmedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 (such as duloxetin, alosetron, theophylline and tizanidine) \nshould be used with caution during treatment with teriflunomide, as it could lead to the reduction of the \nefficacy of these medicinal products. \n \nEffect of teriflunomide on warfarin \nRepeated doses of teriflunomide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin, indicating that \nteriflunomide is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C9. However, a 25% decrease in peak international \nnormalised ratio (INR) was observed when teriflunomide was coadministered with warfarin as compared \nwith warfarin alone. Therefore, when warfarin is co-administered with teriflunomide, close INR follow-up \nand monitoring is recommended. \n \nEffect of teriflunomide on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates  \nThere was an increase in mean cefaclor Cmax and AUC (1.43- and 1.54-fold, respectively), following \nrepeated doses of teriflunomide, suggesting that teriflunomide is an inhibitor of OAT3 in vivo. Therefore, \nwhen teriflunomide is coadministered with substrates of OAT3, such as cefaclor, benzylpenicillin, \nciprofloxacin, indometacin, ketoprofen, furosemide, cimetidine, methotrexate, zidovudine, caution is \nrecommended. \n \nEffect of teriflunomide on BCRP and /or organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/B3) \nsubstrates  \nThere was an increase in mean rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC (2.65- and 2.51-fold, respectively), following \nrepeated doses of teriflunomide. However, there was no apparent impact of this increase in plasma \nrosuvastatin exposure on the HMG-CoA reductase activity. For rosuvastatin, a dose reduction by 50% is \nrecommended for coadministration with teriflunomide. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, \ntopotecan, sulfasalazine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin) and the OATP family especially HMG-Co reductase \ninhibitors (e.g., simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, methotrexate, nateglinide, repaglinide, rifampicin) \nconcomitant administration of teriflunomide should also be undertaken with caution. Patients should be \nclosely monitored for signs and symptoms of excessive exposure to the medicinal products and reduction of \nthe dose of these medicinal products should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nUse in males \n \nThe risk of male-mediated embryo-foetal toxicity through teriflunomide treatment is considered low (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of teriflunomide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nTeriflunomide may cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Teriflunomide is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and after treatment as \nlong as teriflunomide plasma concentration is above 0.02 mg/l. During this period women should discuss any \nplans to stop or change contraception with the treating physician. \n \nThe patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect \npregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing, and if positive, the physician \nand patient must discuss the risk to the pregnancy. It is possible that rapidly lowering the blood level of \nteriflunomide, by instituting the accelerated elimination procedure described below, at the first delay of \nmenses, may decrease the risk to the foetus. \nFor women receiving teriflunomide treatment, who wish to become pregnant, the medicinal product should \nbe stopped and an accelerated elimination procedure is recommended in order to more rapidly achieve \nconcentration below 0.02 mg/l (see below). \n \nIf an accelerated elimination procedure is not used, teriflunomide plasma levels can be expected to be above \n0.02 mg/l for an average of 8 months, however, in some patients it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma \nconcentration below 0.02 mg/l. Therefore, teriflunomide plasma concentrations should be measured before a \nwoman begins to attempt to become pregnant. Once the teriflunomide plasma concentration is determined to \nbe below 0.02 mg/l, the plasma concentration must be determined again after an interval of at least 14 days. \nIf both plasma concentrations are below 0.02 mg/l, no risk to the foetus is to be expected. \nFor further information on the sample testing please contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder or its local \nrepresentative (see section 7). \n \nAccelerated elimination procedure \n \nAfter stopping treatment with teriflunomide: \n\uf0b7 cholestyramine 8 g is administered 3 times daily for a period of 11 days, or cholestyramine 4 g three \n\ntimes a day can be used, if cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well tolerated, \n\uf0b7 alternatively, 50 g of activated powdered charcoal is administered every 12 hours for a period of 11 \n\ndays. \n \nHowever, also following either of the accelerated elimination procedures, verification by 2 separate tests at \nan interval of at least 14 days and a waiting period of one-and-a-half months between the first occurrence of \na plasma concentration below 0.02 mg/l and fertilisation is required. \nBoth cholestyramine and activated powdered charcoal may influence the absorption of oestrogens and \nprogestogens such that reliable contraception with oral contraceptives may not be guaranteed during the \naccelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or activated powdered charcoal. Use of alternative \ncontraceptive methods is recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAnimal studies have shown excretion of teriflunomide in milk. Teriflunomide is contraindicated during \nbreast-feeding (see section 4.3).  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \nFertility \n \nResults of studies in animals have not shown an effect on fertility (see section 5.3). Although human data are \nlacking, no effect on male and female fertility is anticipated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAUBAGIO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.   \nIn the case of adverse reactions such as dizziness, which has been reported with leflunomide, the parent \ncompound, the patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and to react properly may be impaired. In such cases, patients \nshould refrain from driving and using machines. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nA total of 2267 patients were exposed to teriflunomide (1155 on teriflunomide 7 mg and 1112 on \nteriflunomide 14 mg) once daily for a median duration of about 672 days in four placebo-controlled studies \n(1045 and 1002 patients for teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively) and one active comparator study \n(110 patients in each of the teriflunomide treatment groups) in patients with relapsing forms of MS \n(Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis, RMS). \nTeriflunomide is the main metabolite of leflunomide. The safety profile of leflunomide in patients suffering \nfrom rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis may be pertinent when prescribing teriflunomide in MS \npatients. \n \nThe placebo-controlled pooled analysis was based on 2047 patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis treated \nwith teriflunomide once daily. Within this safety population, the most commonly reported adverse reactions \nin the teriflunomide treated patients were: headache, diarrhoea, increased ALT, nausea, and alopecia. In \ngeneral, headache, diarrhoea, nausea and alopecia, were mild to moderate, transient and infrequently led to \ntreatment discontinuation.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported with AUBAGIO in placebo-controlled studies, reported for teriflunomide 7 mg or \n14 mg at \u2265 1% higher rate than for placebo, are shown below. Frequencies were defined using the following \nconvention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are ranked in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \nSystem organ \n\nclass \nVery \n\ncommon \nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \n\nrare \nNot known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n \n \n \n\nInfluenza, \nUpper \nrespiratory tract \ninfection,  \nUrinary tract \ninfection, \nBronchitis, \nSinusitis, \nPharyngitis, \nCystitis, \nGastroenteritis \nviral, \nOral herpes, \nTooth infection, \nLaryngitis, \nTinea pedis \n\n   Severe \ninfections \nincluding \nsepsisa \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n Neutropeniab, \nAnaemia \n\nMild \nthrombocytopen\nia (platelets \n<100G/l) \n\n   \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Mild allergic \nreactions  \n\n   Hyper-\nsensitivity \nreactions \n(immediate \nor delayed) \nincluding \nanaphylaxis \nand \nangioedema \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Anxiety     \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Paraesthesia, \nSciatica, \nCarpal tunnel \nsyndrome \n \n\nHyperaesthesia, \nNeuralgia, \nPeripheral \nneuropathy \n\n   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Palpitations     \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertensionb     \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n     Interstitial \nlung disease \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea, \nNausea \n\nAbdominal pain \nupper, \nVomiting, \nToothache \n\n   \n \n\nPancreatitis, \nStomatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nAlanine \naminotransfer\nase (ALT) \nincreaseb \n\nGamma-\nglutamyltransfer\nase (GGT) \nincreaseb, \nAspartate \naminotransferas\n\n   Acute \nhepatitis \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nNot known \n\ne increaseb \nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n     Dyslipidaem\nia \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia Rash, Acne Nail disorders   Severe skin \nreactionsa, \nPsoriasis \n(including \npustular)b \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Musculoskeletal \npain, \nMyalgia, \nArthralgia \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary disorders \n\n Pollakiuria     \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n Menorrhagia     \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Pain, Astheniaa     \n\nInvestigations  Weight \ndecrease, \nNeutrophil \ncount decreaseb, \nWhite blood cell \ncount decreaseb, \nBlood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased \n\n    \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n  Post-traumatic \npain \n\n   \n\n \na: please refer to the detailed description section \nb: see section 4.4 \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAlopecia \nAlopecia was reported as hair thinning, decreased hair density, hair loss, associated or not with hair texture \nchange, in 13.9% of patients treated with 14 mg teriflunomide versus 5.1% in patients treated with placebo. \nMost cases were described as diffuse or generalised over the scalp (no complete hair loss reported) and \noccurred most often during the first 6 months and with resolution in 121 of 139 (87.1%) patients treated with \nteriflunomide 14 mg. Discontinuation because of alopecia was 1.3% in the teriflunomide 14 mg \nteriflunomide group, versus 0.1% in the placebo group.  \n \nHepatic effects \nDuring placebo-controlled studies the following was detected: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nALT increase (based on laboratory data) according to baseline status - Safety population in placebo-\ncontrolled studies \n\n \nPlacebo \n(N=997) \n\nTeriflunomide 14 mg \n(N=1002) \n\n>3 ULN 66/994 (6.6%) 80/999 (8.0%) \n>5 ULN 37/994 (3.7%) 31/999 (3.1%) \n>10 ULN 16/994 (1.6%) 9/999 (0.9%) \n>20 ULN 4/994 (0.4%) 3/999 (0.3%) \nALT >3 ULN and TBILI >2 ULN 5/994 (0.5%) 3/999 (0.3%) \n \nMild increases in transaminase, ALT below or equal to 3-fold ULN were more frequently seen in \nteriflunomide-treated groups as compared to placebo. The frequency of elevations above 3-fold ULN and \nhigher was balanced across treatment groups. These elevations in transaminase occurred mostly within the \nfirst 6 months of treatment and were reversible after treatment cessation. The recovery time varied between \nmonths and years. \n \nBlood pressure effects \nIn placebo-controlled studies the following was established: \n-  systolic blood pressure was >140 mm Hg in 19.9% of patients receiving 14 mg/day teriflunomide as \n\ncompared to 15.5% receiving placebo;  \n-  systolic blood pressure was >160 mm Hg in 3.8% of patients receiving 14 mg/day teriflunomide as \n\ncompared to 2.0% receiving placebo; \n-  diastolic blood pressure was >90 mm Hg in 21.4% of patients receiving 14 mg/day teriflunomide as \n\ncompared to 13.6% receiving placebo. \n \nInfections \nIn placebo-controlled studies, no increase in serious infections was observed with teriflunomide 14 mg \n(2.7%) as compared to placebo (2.2%). Serious opportunistic infections occurred in 0.2% of each group. \nSevere infections including sepsis, sometimes fatal have been reported postmarketing.  \n \nHaematological effects \nA mean decrease affecting white blood cell (WBC) count (<15% from baseline levels, mainly neutrophil and \nlymphocytes decrease) was observed in placebo-controlled trials with AUBAGIO, although a greater \ndecrease was observed in some patients. The decrease in mean count from baseline occurred during the first \n6 weeks then stabilised over time while on-treatment but at decreased levels (less than a 15% decrease from \nbaseline). The effect on red blood cell (RBC) (<2%) and platelet counts (<10%) was less pronounced. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nIn placebo-controlled studies, peripheral neuropathy, including both polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy \n(e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), was reported more frequently in patients taking teriflunomide than in patients \ntaking placebo. In the pivotal, placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed \nby nerve conduction studies was 1.9% (17 patients out of 898) on 14 mg of teriflunomide, compared with \n0.4% (4 patients out of 898) on placebo. Treatment was discontinued in 5 patients with peripheral \nneuropathy on teriflunomide 14 mg. Recovery following treatment discontinuation was reported in 4 of these \npatients. \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) \nThere does not appear to be an increased risk of malignancy with teriflunomide in the clinical trial \nexperience. The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with use of some \nother agents that affect the immune system (class effect).  \n \nSevere skin reactions  \nCases of severe skin reactions have been reported with teriflunomide post-marketing (see section 4.4). \n \nAsthenia \nIn placebo-controlled studies, frequencies for asthenia were 2.0%, 1.6% and 2.2% in the placebo, \nteriflunomide 7 mg and teriflunomide 14 mg group, respectively. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nSymptoms  \n \nThere is no experience regarding teriflunomide overdose or intoxication in humans. Teriflunomide 70 mg \ndaily was administered up to 14 days in healthy subjects. The adverse reactions were consistent with the \nsafety profile for teriflunomide in MS patients. \n \nManagement  \n \nIn the event of relevant overdose or toxicity, cholestyramine or activated charcoal is recommended to \naccelerate elimination. The recommended elimination procedure is cholestyramine 8 g three times a day for \n11 days. If this is not well tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three times a day for 11 days can be used. \nAlternatively, when cholestyramine is not available, activated charcoal 50 g twice a day for 11 days may also \nbe used. In addition, if required for tolerability reasons, administration of cholestyramine or activated \ncharcoal does not need to occur on consecutive days (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Selective immunosuppressants, ATC Code: L04AA31 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTeriflunomide is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties that selectively and \nreversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), required for the de \nnovo pyrimidine synthesis. As a consequence teriflunomide reduces the proliferation of dividing cells that \nneed de novo synthesis of pyrimidine to expand. The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide exerts its \ntherapeutic effect in MS is not fully understood, but this is mediated by a reduced number of lymphocytes. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nImmune system \nEffects on immune cell numbers in the blood: In the placebo-controlled studies, teriflunomide 14 mg once a \nday led to a mild mean reduction in lymphocyte count, of less than 0.3 x 109/l, which occurred over the first \n3 months of treatment and levels were maintained until the end of the treatment. \n \nPotential to prolong the QT interval \nIn a placebo-controlled thorough QT study performed in healthy subjects, teriflunomide at mean steady-state \nconcentrations did not show any potential for prolonging the QTcF interval compared with placebo: the \nlargest time matched mean difference between teriflunomide and placebo was 3.45 ms with the upper bound \nof the 90% CI being 6.45 ms.  \n \nEffect on renal tubular functions \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, mean decreases in serum uric acid at a range of 20 to 30% were observed \nin patients treated with teriflunomide compared to placebo. Mean decrease in serum phosphorus was around \n10% in the teriflunomide group compared to placebo. These effects are considered to be related to increase \nin renal tubular excretion and not related to changes in glomerular functions. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of AUBAGIO was demonstrated in two placebo controlled studies, the TEMSO and the \nTOWER study, that evaluated once daily doses of teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg in patients with RMS. \n \nA total of 1088 patients with RMS were randomised in TEMSO to receive 7 mg (n=366) or 14 mg (n=359) \nof teriflunomide or placebo (n= 363) for 108 weeks duration. All patients had a definite diagnosis of MS \n(based on McDonald criteria (2001)), exhibited a relapsing clinical course, with or without progression, and \nexperienced at least 1 relapse over the year preceding the trial or at least 2 relapses over the 2 years \npreceding the trial. At entry, patients had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \u22645.5.  \nThe mean age of the study population was 37.9 years. The majority of patients had relapsing\u2013remitting \nmultiple sclerosis (91.5%), but a subgroup of patients had secondary progressive (4.7%) or progressive \nrelapsing multiple sclerosis (3.9%). The mean number of relapses within the year before study inclusion was \n1.4 with 36.2% of patients having gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline. The median EDSS score at \nbaseline was 2.50; 249 patients (22.9%) had an EDSS score \u203a 3.5 at baseline. The mean duration of disease, \nsince first symptoms, was 8.7 years. A majority of patients (73%) had not received disease-modifying \ntherapy during the 2 years before study entry. The study results are shown in Table 1.  \n \nLong term follow-up results from TEMSO long term extension safety study (overall median treatment \nduration approximately 5 years, maximum treatment duration approximately 8.5 years) did not present any \nnew or unexpected safety findings. \n \nA total of 1169 patients with RMS were randomised in TOWER to receive 7 mg (n=408) or 14 mg (n=372) \nof teriflunomide or placebo (n= 389) for a variable treatment duration ending at 48 weeks after last patient \nrandomised. All patients had a definite diagnosis of MS (based on McDonald criteria (2005)), exhibited a \nrelapsing clinical course, with or without progression, and experienced at least 1 relapse over the year \npreceding the trial or at least 2 relapses over the 2 years preceding the trial. At entry, patients had an \nExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \u22645.5.  \nThe mean age of the study population was 37.9 years. The majority of patients had relapsing\u2013remitting \nmultiple sclerosis (97.5%), but a subgroup of patients had secondary progressive (0.8%) or progressive \nrelapsing multiple sclerosis (1.7%). The mean number of relapses within the year before study inclusion was \n1.4. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline: no data. The median EDSS score at baseline was 2.50; 298 \npatients (25.5%) had an EDSS score \u203a 3.5 at baseline. The mean duration of disease, since first symptoms, \nwas 8.0 years. A majority of patients (67.2%) had not received disease-modifying therapy during the 2 years \nbefore study entry.

Due to the design of the study, high \ndisease activity was defined as 2 or more relapses in one year, and with one or more Gd-enhancing lesion on \nbrain MRI. No similar subgroup analysis was performed in TOWER as no MRI data were obtained. \nNo data are available in patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least \none year of treatment) of beta-interferon, having had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, \nand at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion, or patients having an \nunchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 2 years.  \n \nTOPIC was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated once daily doses of teriflunomide 7 mg \nand 14 mg for up to 108 weeks in patients with first clinical demyelinating event (mean age 32.1 years). The \nprimary endpoint was time to a second clinical episode (relapse). A total of 618 patients were randomised to \nreceive 7 mg (n=205) or 14 mg (n=216) of teriflunomide or placebo (n=197). The risk of a second clinical \nattack over 2 years was 35.9% in the placebo group and 24.0% in the teriflunomide 14 mg treatment group \n(hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.87, p=0.0087). The results from the TOPIC study \nconfirmed the efficacy of teriflunomide in RRMS (including early RRMS with first clinical demyelinating \nevent and MRI lesions disseminated in time and space). \n \nTeriflunomide effectiveness was compared to that of a subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (at the recommended \ndose of 44 \u00b5g three times a week) in 324 randomised patients in a study (TENERE) with minimum treatment \nduration of 48 weeks (maximum 114 weeks). The risk of failure (confirmed relapse or permanent treatment \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\ndiscontinuation whichever came first) was the primary endpoint. The number of patients with permanent \ntreatment discontinuation in the teriflunomide 14 mg group was 22 out of 111 (19.8%), the reasons being \nadverse events (10.8%), lack of efficacy (3.6%), other reason (4.5%) and lost to follow-up (0.9%). The \nnumber of patients with permanent treatment discontinuation in the subcutaneous interferon beta-1a group \nwas 30 out of 104 (28 .8%), the reasons being adverse events (21.2%), lack of efficacy (1.9%), other reason \n(4.8%) and poor compliance to protocol (1%). Teriflunomide 14 mg/day was not superior to interferon beta-\n1a on the primary endpoint: the estimated percentage of patients with treatment failure at 96 weeks using the \nKaplan-Meier method was 41.1% versus 44.4% (teriflunomide 14 mg versus interferon beta-1a group, \np=0.595). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with AUBAGIO \nin children from birth to less than 10 years in treatment of multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with AUBAGIO \nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMedian time to reach maximum plasma concentrations occurs between 1 to 4 hours post-dose following \nrepeated oral administration of teriflunomide, with high bioavailability (approximately 100%). \n \nFood does not have a clinically relevant effect on teriflunomide pharmacokinetics. \n \nFrom the mean predicted pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from the population pharmacokinetic \n(PopPK) analysis using data from healthy volunteers and MS patients, there is a slow approach to steady-\nstate concentration (i.e., approximately 100 days (3.5 months) to attain 95% of steady-state concentrations) \nand the estimated AUC accumulation ratio is approximately 34-fold. \n \nDistribution \n \nTeriflunomide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>99%), probably albumin and is mainly distributed in \nplasma. The volume of distribution is 11 l after a single intravenous (IV) administration. However, this is \nmost likely an underestimation since extensive organ distribution was observed in rats. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTeriflunomide is moderately metabolised and is the only component detected in plasma. The primary \nbiotransformation pathway for teriflunomide is hydrolysis with oxidation being a minor pathway. Secondary \npathways involve oxidation, N-acetylation and sulfate conjugation. \n \nElimination \n \nTeriflunomide is excreted in the gastrointestinal tract mainly through the bile as unchanged medicinal \nproduct and most likely by direct secretion. Teriflunomide is a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP, \nwhich could be involved in direct secretion. Over 21 days, 60.1% of the administered dose is excreted via \nfeces (37.5%) and urine (22.6%). After the rapid elimination procedure with cholestyramine, an additional \n23.1% was recovered (mostly in feces). Based on individual prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters using \nthe PopPK model of teriflunomide in healthy volunteers and MS patients, median t1/2z was approximately \n19 days after repeated doses of 14 mg. After a single intravenous administration, the total body clearance of \nteriflunomide is 30.5 ml/h. \n \nAccelerated Elimination Procedure: Cholestyramine and activated charcoal  \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe elimination of teriflunomide from the circulation can be accelerated by administration of cholestyramine \nor activated charcoal, presumably by interrupting the reabsorption processes at the intestinal level. \nTeriflunomide concentrations measured during an 11-day procedure to accelerate teriflunomide elimination \nwith either 8 g cholestyramine three times a day, 4 g cholestyramine three times a day or 50 g activated \ncharcoal twice a day following cessation of teriflunomide treatment have shown that these regimens were \neffective in accelerating teriflunomide elimination, leading to more than 98% decrease in teriflunomide \nplasma concentrations, with cholestyramine being faster than charcoal. Following discontinuation of \nteriflunomide and the administration of cholestyramine 8 g three times a day, the plasma concentration of \nteriflunomide is reduced 52% at the end of day 1, 91% at the end of day 3, 99.2% at the end of day 7, and \n99.9% at the completion of day 11. The choice between the 3 elimination procedures should depend on the \npatient\u2019s tolerability. If cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well-tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three \ntimes a day can be used. Alternatively, activated charcoal may also be used (the 11 days do not need to be \nconsecutive unless there is a need to lower teriflunomide plasma concentration rapidly). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nSystemic exposure increases in a dose proportional manner after oral administration teriflunomide from 7 to \n14 mg.  \n \nCharacteristics in specific groups of patients \n \nGender, Elderly, Paediatric patients \nSeveral sources of intrinsic variability were identified in healthy subjects and MS patients based on the \nPopPK analysis: age, body weight, gender, race, and albumin and bilirubin levels. Nevertheless, their impact \nremains limited (\uf0a331%). \n \nHepatic impairment \nMild and moderate hepatic impairment had no impact on the pharmacokinetic of teriflunomide. Therefore no \ndose adjustment is anticipated in mild and moderate hepatic-impaired patients. However, teriflunomide is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nSevere renal impairment had no impact on the pharmacokinetic of teriflunomide. Therefore no dose \nadjustment is anticipated in mild, moderate and severe renal-impaired patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated oral administration of teriflunomide to mice, rats and dogs for up to 3, 6, and 12 months, \nrespectively, revealed that the major targets of toxicity were the bone marrow, lymphoid organs, oral cavity/ \ngastro intestinal tract, reproductive organs, and pancreas. Evidence of an oxidative effect on red blood cells \nwas also observed. Anemia, decreased platelet counts and effects on the immune system, including \nleukopenia, lymphopenia and secondary infections, were related to the effects on the bone marrow and/or \nlymphoid organs. The majority of effects reflect the basic mode of action of the compound (inhibition of \ndividing cells). Animals are more sensitive to the pharmacology, and therefore toxicity, of teriflunomide than \nhumans. As a result, toxicity in animals was found at exposures equivalent or below human therapeutic \nlevels.  \n \nTeriflunomide was not mutagenic in vitro or clastogenic in vivo. Clastogenicity observed in vitro was \nconsidered to be an indirect effect related to nucleotide pool imbalance resulting from the pharmacology of \nDHO-DH inhibition. The minor metabolite TFMA (4-trifluoromethylaniline) caused mutagenicity and \nclastogenicity in vitro but not in vivo. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in rats and mice. \n \nFertility was unaffected in rats despite adverse effects of teriflunomide on male reproductive organs, \nincluding reduced sperm count. There were no external malformations in the offspring of male rats \nadministered teriflunomide prior to mating with untreated female rats. Teriflunomide was embryotoxic and \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nteratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses in the human therapeutic range. Adverse effects on the offspring were \nalso seen when teriflunomide was administered to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation. The risk of \nmale-mediated embryo-fetal toxicity through teriflunomide treatment is considered low. The estimated \nfemale plasma exposure via the semen of a treated patient is expected to be 100 times lower than the plasma \nexposure after 14 mg of oral teriflunomide. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What AUBAGIO is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take AUBAGIO \n3. How to take AUBAGIO  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store AUBAGIO  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What AUBAGIO is and what it is used for \n \nWhat AUBAGIO is \nAUBAGIO contains the active substance teriflunomide which is an immunomodulatory agent and adjusts the \nimmune system to limit its attack on the nervous system.  \n \nWhat AUBAGIO is used for \nAUBAGIO is used in adults to treat relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). \n \nWhat multiple sclerosis is \nMS is a long-term illness that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of the brain \nand spinal cord. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the \nnerves in the CNS. This loss of myelin is called demyelination. This stops nerves from working properly.  \n \nPeople with relapsing form of multiple sclerosis will have repeated attacks (relapses) of physical symptoms \ncaused by their nerves not working properly. These symptoms vary from patient to patient but usually \ninvolve: \n\u2022 difficulty walking \n\u2022  vision problems \n\u2022  balance problems. \n \nSymptoms may disappear completely after the relapse is over, but over time, some problems may remain \nbetween relapses. This can cause physical disabilities that may interfere with your daily activities. \n \nHow AUBAGIO works \nAUBAGIO helps to protect against attacks on the central nervous system by the immune system by limiting \nthe increase of some white blood cells (lymphocytes). This limits the inflammation that leads to nerve \ndamage in MS. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take AUBAGIO  \n \nDo not take AUBAGIO: \n- if you are allergic to teriflunomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6), \n- if you have severe liver problems, \n- if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are breast-feeding, \n- if you suffer from a serious problem which affects your immune system e.g. acquired \n\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), \n- if you have a serious problem with your bone marrow, or if you have low numbers of red or white \n\ncells in your blood or a reduced number of blood platelets, \n- if you are suffering from a serious infection, \n- if you have severe kidney problems which require dialysis, \n- if you have very low levels of proteins in your blood (hypoproteinaemia), \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking AUBAGIO if: \n-  you have liver problems and/or if you drink large amounts of alcohol. Your doctor will carry out blood \n\ntests before and during treatment to check how well your liver is working. If your test results show a \nproblem with your liver, your doctor may stop your treatment with AUBAGIO. Please read section 4. \n\n-  you have high blood pressure (hypertension) whether it is controlled with medicines or not. \nAUBAGIO can cause an increase in blood pressure. Your doctor will check your blood pressure \nbefore the start of treatment and regularly thereafter. Please read section 4. \n\n-  you have an infection. Before you take AUBAGIO, your doctor will make sure you have enough white \nblood cells and platelets in your blood. As AUBAGIO decreases the number of white cells in the \nblood this may affect your ability to fight the infection. Your doctor may do blood tests to check your \nwhite blood cells if you think you have an infection. Please read section 4. \n\n- you have severe skin reactions. \n- you have respiratory symptoms. \n- you have weakness, numbness and pain in the hands and feet. \n- you are going to have a vaccination. \n- you take leflunomide with AUBAGIO. \n- you are switching to or from AUBAGIO. \n- you are lactose intolerant.  \n- you are due to have a specific blood test (calcium level). Falsely low levels of calcium can be detected. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAUBAGIO should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because the effects \nof the medicine in this age group are not known.  \n \nOther medicines and AUBAGIO  \nTell your your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription. \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:  \n- leflunomide, methotrexate and other medicines that affect the immune system (often called \n\nimmunosuppressants or immunomodulators) \n- rifampicin (a medicine used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin for epilepsy \n- St John\u2019s wort (a herbal medicine for depression) \n- repaglinide, pioglitazone, nateglinide, or rosiglitazone for diabetes \n- daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan for cancer \n- duloxetine for depression, urinary incontinenece or in kidney disease in diabetics \n- alosetron for the management of severe diarrhea \n- theophylline for asthma \n- tizanidine, a muscle relaxant \n- warfarin, an anticoagulant used to make the blood thinner (i.e. more fluid) in order to avoid blood clots \n- oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n- cefaclor, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), ciprofloxacin for infections \n- indometacin, ketoprofen for pain or inflammation \n- furosemide for heart disease \n- cimetidine for reducing gastric acid \n- zidovudine for HIV infection \n- rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) \n- sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis \n- cholestyramine for high cholesterol or relief from itching in liver disease \n- activated charcoal to reduce absorption of medicines or other substances \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nDo not take AUBAGIO if you are, or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or become pregnant \nwhile taking AUBAGIO, the risk of having a baby with birth defects is increased. Women of childbearing \npotential must not take this medicine without using reliable contraceptive measures. \n \nTell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with AUBAGIO, as you need to \nensure that most of this medicine has left your body before trying to become pregnant. The elimination of the \nactive substance may take up to 2 years to occur naturally. The time can be reduced to a few weeks by taking \ncertain medicines which speed up removal of AUBAGIO from your body. \nIn either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that the active substance has been sufficiently removed \nfrom your body and you need confirmation from your treating physician that the blood level of AUBAGIO is \nlow enough to allow you to become pregnant. \n \nFor further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. \n \nIf you suspect that you are pregnant while taking AUBAGIO or in the two years after you have stopped \ntreatment, you must contact your doctor immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test confirms that you are \npregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain medicines to remove AUBAGIO rapidly and \nsufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to your baby. \n \nContraception \nYou must use an effective method of contraception during and after treatment with AUBAGIO. \nTeriflunomide remains in your blood for a long time after you stop taking it. Continue to use effective \ncontraception after you stop treatment. \n\u2022  Do this until the levels of AUBAGIO in your blood are low enough - your doctor will check this. \n\u2022  Talk with your doctor about the best method of contraception for you and any potential need for \n\ncontraception change. \n \nDo not take AUBAGIO when you are breast-feeding, as teriflunomide passes into the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAUBAGIO might make you feel dizzy which may impair your ability to concentrate and react. If you are \naffected, do not drive or use machines. \n \nAUBAGIO contains lactose \nAUBAGIO contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take AUBAGIO  \n \nTreatment with AUBAGIO will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of multiple \nsclerosis. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nThe recommended dose is one film-coated tablet (14 mg) daily.  \n \nRoute/method of administration \nAUBAGIO is for oral use. AUBAGIO is taken every day as a single daily dose at any time of the day.  \nYou should swallow the tablet whole with some water. \nAUBAGIO may be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more AUBAGIO than you should \nIf you have taken too much AUBAGIO, call your doctor straight away. You may experience side effects \nsimilar to those described in section 4 below. \n \nIf you forget to take AUBAGIO  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.

immunomodulatory agent and adjusts the immune system to limit its attack on the nervous system. what aubagio is used for aubagio is used in adults to treat relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (ms). what multiple sclerosis is ms is a long-term illness that affects the central nervous system (cns). the cns is made up of the brain and spinal cord. in multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the nerves in the cns. this loss of myelin is called demyelination. this stops nerves from working properly. people with relapsing form of multiple sclerosis will have repeated attacks (relapses) of physical symptoms caused by their nerves not working properly. these symptoms vary from patient to patient but usually involve: difficulty walking vision problems balance problems. symptoms may disappear completely after the relapse is over, but over time, some problems may remain between relapses. this can cause physical disabilities that may interfere with your daily activities. how aubagio works aubagio helps to protect against attacks on the central nervous system by the immune system by limiting the increase of some white blood cells (lymphocytes). this limits the inflammation that leads to nerve damage in ms.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "aubagio", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the

using reliable contraceptive measures. tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with aubagio, as you need to ensure that most of this medicine has left your body before trying to become pregnant. the elimination of the active substance may take up to 2 years to occur naturally. the time can be reduced to a few weeks by taking certain medicines which speed up removal of aubagio from your body. in either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that the active substance has been sufficiently removed from your body and you need confirmation from your treating physician that the blood level of aubagio is low enough to allow you to become pregnant. for further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. if you suspect that you are pregnant while taking aubagio or in the two years after you have stopped treatment, you must contact your doctor immediately for a pregnancy test. if the test confirms that you are pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain medicines to remove aubagio rapidly and sufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to your baby. contraception you must use an effective method of contraception during and after treatment with aubagio. teriflunomide remains in your blood for a long time after you stop taking it. continue to use effective contraception after you stop treatment. do this until the levels of aubagio in your blood are low enough - your doctor will check this. talk with your doctor about the best method of contraception for you and any potential need for contraception change. do not take aubagio when you are breast-feeding, as teriflunomide passes into the breast milk. driving and using machines aubagio might make you feel dizzy which may impair
