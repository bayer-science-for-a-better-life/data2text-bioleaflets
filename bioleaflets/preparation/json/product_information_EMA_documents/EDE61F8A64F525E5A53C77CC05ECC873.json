This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nKisqali 200 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains ribociclib succinate, equivalent to 200 mg ribociclib. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 0.344 mg soya lecithin. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nLight greyish violet, unscored, round, curved with bevelled edges (approximate diameter: 11.1 mm), \n\ndebossed with “RIC” on one side and “NVR” on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nKisqali is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human \n\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in \n\ncombination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women \n\nwho have received prior endocrine therapy. \n\n \n\nIn pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinising \n\nhormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with Kisqali should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer \n\ntherapies. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 600 mg (three 200 mg film-coated tablets) of ribociclib once daily for \n\n21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment, resulting in a complete cycle of 28 days. The \n\ntreatment should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until \n\nunacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nKisqali should be used together with 2.5 mg letrozole or another aromatase inhibitor or with 500 mg \n\nfulvestrant. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nWhen Kisqali is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, the aromatase inhibitor should be \n\ntaken orally once daily continuously throughout the 28-day cycle. Please refer to the Summary of \n\nProduct Characteristics (SmPC) of the aromatase inhibitor for additional details. \n\n \n\nWhen Kisqali is used in combination with fulvestrant, fulvestrant is administered intramuscularly on \n\ndays 1, 15 and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the SmPC of fulvestrant for additional \n\ndetails. \n\n \n\nTreatment of pre- and perimenopausal women with the approved Kisqali combinations should also \n\ninclude an LHRH agonist in accordance with local clinical practice. \n\n \n\nKisqali can be taken with or without food (see section 4.5). Patients should be encouraged to take their \n\ndose at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. If the patient vomits after \n\ntaking the dose or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed \n\ndose should be taken at the usual time. \n\n \n\nDose modifications \n\nManagement of severe or intolerable adverse events (AEs) may require temporary dose interruption, \n\nreduction or discontinuation of Kisqali. If dose reduction is required, the recommended dose reduction \n\nguidelines are listed in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose modification guidelines \n \n\n Kisqali \n\nDose Number of 200 mg tablets \n\nStarting dose 600 mg/day 3 \n\nFirst dose reduction 400 mg/day 2 \n\nSecond dose reduction 200 mg*/day 1 \n\n* If further dose reduction below 200 mg/day is required, the treatment should be permanently \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nTables 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 summarise recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation \n\nof Kisqali in the management of specific AEs. The clinical judgement of the treating physician should \n\nguide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nComplete blood counts (CBC) should be performed before initiating treatment with Kisqali. After \n\ninitiating treatment CBC should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of \n\neach of the subsequent 4 cycles, then as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2 Dose modification and management – Neutropenia \n \n\n Grade 1 or 2* \n(ANC \n\n1000/mm3 - ≤LLN) \n\nGrade 3* \n(ANC \n\n500 - <1000/mm3) \n\nGrade 3* febrile \n\nneutropenia** \n\nGrade 4* \n(ANC \n\n<500/mm3) \n\nNeutropenia No dose adjustment is \n\nrequired \n\nDose interruption \n\nuntil recovery to \n\ngrade ≤2. \n\nResume Kisqali at \n\nthe same dose \n\nlevel. \n\nIf toxicity recurs \n\nat grade 3: dose \n\ninterruption until \n\nrecovery to \n\ngrade ≤2, then \n\nresume Kisqali \n\nand reduce by \n\n1 dose level. \n\nDose interruption \n\nuntil recovery to \n\ngrade ≤2.

If patients \n\nmust be given a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor concomitantly with ribociclib, the Kisqali dose should be \n\nreduced to 400 mg once daily (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn patients who have had their dose reduced to 400 mg ribociclib daily and in whom initiation of \n\nco-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose should be further reduced \n\nto 200 mg. \n\n \n\nIn patients who have had their dose reduced to 200 mg ribociclib daily and in whom initiation of \n\nco-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, Kisqali treatment should be \n\ninterrupted. \n\n \n\nDue to inter-patient variability, the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal in all patients, \n\ntherefore close monitoring of signs of toxicity is recommended. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, \n\nthe Kisqali dose should be changed to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor after at least 5 half-lives of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nA starting dose of 400 mg is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nCaution should be used in patients with severe renal impairment with close monitoring for signs of \n\ntoxicity. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). \n\nPatients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) can \n\nhave increased (less than 2-fold) exposure to ribociclib and the starting dose of 400 mg Kisqali once \n\ndaily is recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Kisqali in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nKisqali should be taken orally once daily with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole \n\nand should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing. No tablet should be ingested if it is \n\nbroken, cracked or otherwise not intact. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanut, soya or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nCritical visceral disease \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of ribociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia \n\n \n\nBased on the severity of the neutropenia, treatment with Kisqali may have to be interrupted, reduced \n\nor discontinued as described in Table 2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary toxicity \n\n \n\nLiver function tests should be performed before initiating treatment with Kisqali. After initiating \n\ntreatment, liver function should be monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nBased on the severity of the transaminase elevations, treatment with Kisqali may have to be \n\ninterrupted, reduced or discontinued as described in Table 3 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\nRecommendations for patients who have elevated AST/ALT grade ≥ 3 at baseline have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\n \n\nIn study E2301 (MONALEESA-7), a QTcF interval increase >60 msec from baseline was observed in \n\n14/87 (16.1%) patients receiving Kisqali plus tamoxifen and in 18/245 (7.3%) patients receiving \n\nKisqali plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). Kisqali is not recommended to be used in \n\ncombination with tamoxifen (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nECG should be assessed before initiating treatment. Treatment with Kisqali should be initiated only in \n\npatients with QTcF values less than 450 msec. ECG should be repeated at approximately day 14 of the \n\nfirst cycle and at the beginning of the second cycle, then as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.8). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAppropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium, calcium, phosphorus and \n\nmagnesium) should be performed before initiating treatment, at the beginning of the first 6 cycles and \n\nthen as clinically indicated. Any abnormality should be corrected before initiating treatment with \n\nKisqali and during treatment with Kisqali. \n\n \n\nThe use of Kisqali should be avoided in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of \n\ndeveloping QTc prolongation. This includes patients: \n\n with long QT syndrome; \n\n with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, \ncongestive heart failure, unstable angina and bradyarrhythmias; \n\n with electrolyte abnormalities. \n \n\nThe use of Kisqali with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval and/or strong CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors should be avoided as this may lead to clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTcF \n\ninterval (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.1). If treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, \n\nthe dose should be reduced to 400 mg once daily (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nBased on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, treatment with Kisqali may have to be \n\ninterrupted, reduced or discontinued as described in Table 4 (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous reactions \n\n \n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been reported with Kisqali treatment. If signs and symptoms \n\nsuggestive of severe cutaneous reactions (e.g. progressive widespread skin rash often with blisters or \n\nmucosal lesions) appear, Kisqali should be discontinued immediately. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease/pneumonitis \n\n \n\nILD/pneumonitis has been reported with CDK4/6 inhibitors including Kisqali. In the 3 phase III \n\nclinical studies (MONALEESA-2 [A2301], MONALEESA-7 [E2301-NSAI] and MONALEESA-3 \n\n[F2301]), ILD (any grade 0.3%, including 0.1% grade 3) was reported in the Kisqali-treated group, \n\nwith no cases in the placebo-treated group. Pneumonitis was reported in both the Kisqali- and the \n\nplacebo-treated groups (any grade 0.4%, with no grade 3 or 4 in either treatment group). \n\n \n\nBased on the severity of the ILD/pneumonitis, which may be fatal, Kisqali may require dose \n\ninterruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 5 (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis which may \n\ninclude hypoxia, cough and dyspnoea and dose modifications should be managed in accordance with \n\nTable 5 (see section 4.2) \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 substrates \n\n \n\nRibociclib is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor at the 600 mg dose and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor at the \n\n400 mg dose. Thus, ribociclib may interact with medicinal products which are metabolised via \n\nCYP3A4, which may lead to increased serum concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (see section 4.5). \n\nCaution is recommended in case of concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow \n\ntherapeutic index and the SmPC of the other product should be consulted for the recommendations \n\nregarding co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception while \n\ntaking Kisqali and for at least 21 days after the last dose (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSoya lecithin \n\n \n\nKisqali contains soya lecithin. Patients who are hypersensitive to peanut or soya should not take \n\nKisqali (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSubstances that may increase ribociclib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nRibociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal products that can influence \n\nCYP3A4 enzyme activity may alter the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. Co-administration of the \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir (100 mg twice daily for 14 days) with a single 400 mg dose of \n\nribociclib increased ribociclib exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) in healthy subjects \n\n3.2 and 1.7-fold, respectively, relative to a single 400 mg ribociclib dose given alone. Cmax and AUClast \n\nfor LEQ803 (a prominent metabolite of ribociclib accounting for less than 10% of parent exposure) \n\ndecreased by 96% and 98%, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors including, but not limited to, the following must be \n\navoided: clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, \n\nnelfinavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil and voriconazole (see \n\nsection 4.4). Alternative concomitant medicinal products with less potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should \n\nbe considered and patients should be monitored for ribociclib-related AEs (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\nIf co-administration of Kisqali with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose of Kisqali \n\nshould be reduced as described in section 4.2. However, there are no clinical data with these dose \n\nadjustments. Due to inter-patient variability, the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal \n\nin all patients, therefore close monitoring for ribociclib-related AEs is recommended. In the event of \n\nribociclib-related toxicity, the dose should be modified or treatment should be interrupted until toxicity \n\nis resolved (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). If the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, and after at least \n\n5 half-lives of the CYP3A4 inhibitor (refer to the SmPC of the CYP3A4 inhibitor in question), Kisqali \n\nshould be resumed at the same dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nPhysiologically-based pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that at a 600 mg dose of ribociclib, a \n\nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin) may increase ribociclib steady-state Cmax and AUC \n\n1.2-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. For patients who had their ribociclib dose reduced to 400 mg once \n\ndaily, the increase of the steady-state Cmax and AUC was estimated to be 1.4- and 2.1-fold, \n\nrespectively. The effect at the 200 mg once-daily dose was predicted to be a 1.7- and 2.8-fold increase, \n\nrespectively. No dose adjustments of ribociclib are required at initiation of treatment with mild or \n\nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, monitoring of ribociclib-related AEs is recommended. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice. These are known to inhibit \n\ncytochrome CYP3A4 enzymes and may increase the exposure to ribociclib. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may decrease ribociclib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nCo-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 14 days) with a single \n\n600 mg dose of ribociclib decreased the ribociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 89% and 81%, respectively, \n\nrelative to a single 600 mg ribociclib dose given alone in healthy subjects. LEQ803 Cmax increased \n\n1.7-fold and AUCinf decreased by 27%, respectively. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers \n\nmay therefore lead to decreased exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. The \n\nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, including, but not limited to, \n\nphenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine and St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). An alternative \n\nconcomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inducer on ribociclib exposure has not been studied. \n\nPhysiologically-based pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inducer \n\n(efavirenz) may decrease steady-state ribociclib Cmax and AUC by 51% and 70%, respectively. The \n\nconcomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers may therefore lead to decreased exposure and \n\nconsequently a risk for impaired efficacy, in particular in patients treated with ribociclib at 400 mg or \n\n200 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may have plasma concentrations altered by Kisqali \n\n \n\nRibociclib is a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and may interact with medicinal substrates that \n\nare metabolised via CYP3A4, which can lead to increased serum concentrations of the concomitantly \n\nused medicinal product. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) with multiple doses of Kisqali (400 mg) \n\nincreased the midazolam exposure by 280% (3.80-fold) in healthy subjects, compared with \n\nadministration of midazolam alone. Simulations using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models \n\nsuggested that Kisqali given at the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg is expected to increase the \n\nmidazolam AUC by 5.2-fold. Therefore, in general, when ribociclib is co-administered with other \n\nmedicinal products, the SmPC of the other medicinal product must be consulted for the \n\nrecommendations regarding co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Caution is recommended in \n\ncase of concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (see \n\nsection 4.4). The dose of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index, including but \n\nnot limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, everolimus, fentanyl, sirolimus and tacrolimus, may need to be \n\nreduced as ribociclib can increase their exposure. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of ribociclib at the 600 mg dose with the following CYP3A4 substrates \n\nshould be avoided: alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine, quetiapine, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) with multiple doses of Kisqali (400 mg) increased \n\nthe caffeine exposure by 20% (1.20-fold) in healthy subjects, compared with administration of \n\ncaffeine alone. At the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg, simulations using PBPK models predicted \n\nonly weak inhibitory effects of ribociclib on CYP1A2 substrates (<2-fold increase in AUC). \n\n \n\nSubstances that are substrates of transporters \n\n \n\nIn vitro evaluations indicated that ribociclib has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters \n\nP-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. Caution and monitoring for toxicity \n\nare advised during concomitant treatment with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit \n\na narrow therapeutic index, including but not limited to digoxin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin \n\nand metformin. \n\n \n\nDrug-food interactions \n\n \n\nKisqali can be administered with or without food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that elevate gastric pH \n\n \n\nRibociclib exhibits high solubility at or below pH 4.5 and in bio-relevant media (at pH 5.0 and 6.5). \n\nCo-administration of ribociclib with medicinal products that elevate the gastric pH was not evaluated \n\nin a clinical study; however, altered ribociclib absorption was not observed in population \n\npharmacokinetic and non–compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nDrug-drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole \n\n \n\nData from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer and population pharmacokinetic analysis \n\nindicated no drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole following co-administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole \n\n \n\nData from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant drug \n\ninteraction between ribociclib and anastrozole following co-administration of these medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction between ribociclib and fulvestrant \n\n \n\nData from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant effects of \n\nfulvestrant on ribociclib exposure following co-administration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction between ribociclib and tamoxifen \n\n \n\nData from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer indicated that tamoxifen exposure was \n\nincreased approximately 2-fold following co-administration of ribociclib and tamoxifen. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interactions between ribociclib and oral contraceptives \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction studies between ribociclib and oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see \n\nsection 4.6). \n\n \n\nAnticipated interactions \n\n \n\nAnti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other medicinal products that may prolong the QT interval \n\nCo-administration of Kisqali with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT \n\ninterval such as anti-arrhythmic medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, \n\ndisopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol), and other medicinal products that are known to \n\nprolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, \n\nciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, azithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil, pimozide \n\nand intravenous ondansetron) should be avoided (see section 4.4). Kisqali is also not recommended to \n\nbe used in combination with tamoxifen (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\n \n\nPregnancy status should be verified prior to starting treatment with Kisqali. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential who are receiving Kisqali should use effective contraception (e.g. \n\ndouble-barrier contraception) during therapy and for at least 21 days after stopping treatment with \n\nKisqali. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on findings in animals, \n\nribociclib can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Kisqali is \n\nnot recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known if ribociclib is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of ribociclib on \n\nthe breast-fed infant or the effects of ribociclib on milk production. Ribociclib and its metabolites \n\nreadily passed into the milk of lactating rats. Patients receiving Kisqali should not breast-feed for at \n\nleast 21 days after the last dose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data available regarding effects of ribociclib on fertility. Based on animal studies, \n\nribociclib may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nKisqali may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \n\nto be cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue, dizziness or vertigo \n\nduring treatment with Kisqali (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common ADRs and the most common grade 3/4 ADRs (reported at a frequency ≥20% and \n\n≥2%, respectively) in the pooled dataset for which the frequency for Kisqali plus any combination \n\nexceeds the frequency for placebo plus any combination were infections, neutropenia, leukopenia, \n\nheadache, cough, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, alopecia and rash, and infections, \n\nneutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, abnormal liver function tests, lymphopenia, hypophosphataemia \n\nand vomiting respectively. \n\n \n\nDose reduction due to adverse events, regardless of causality, occurred in 37.3% of patients receiving \n\nKisqali in the phase III clinical studies regardless of the combination and permanent discontinuation \n\nwas reported in 7.0% of patients receiving Kisqali and any combination in the phase III clinical \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe overall safety evaluation of Kisqali is based on the pooled dataset from 1,065 patients who \n\nreceived Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (N=582 in combination with an aromatase \n\ninhibitor and N=483 in combination with fulvestrant) and who were included in the randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical studies (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7 NSAI \n\nsubgroup and MONALEESA-3) in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. \n\nAdditional ADRs were identified post-marketing. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of exposure to Kisqali treatment across the pooled phase III studies dataset was \n\n21.7 months, with 61.7% patients exposed ≥12 months. \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions from the phase III clinical studies (Table 7) are listed by MedDRA system \n\norgan class. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with \n\nthe most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are \n\npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for \n\neach adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); \n\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 7 Adverse drug reactions observed in the three phase III clinical studies and during \n\npost-marketing experience \n \n\nAdverse drug reaction Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nInfections1 Very common \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNeutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, lymphopenia Very common \n\nThrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia Common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nDecreased appetite Very common \n\nHypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia Common \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadache, dizziness Very common \n\nVertigo Common \n\nEye disorders \n\nLacrimation increased, dry eye Common \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nSyncope Common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea, cough Very common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, stomatitis, abdominal pain2, \n\ndyspepsia \nVery common \n\nDysgeusia Common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nHepatotoxicity3 Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nAlopecia, rash4, pruritus Very common \n\nErythema, dry skin, vitiligo Common \n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)* Not known \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nBack pain Very common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nFatigue, peripheral oedema, asthenia, pyrexia Very common \n\nDry mouth, oropharyngeal pain Common \n\nInvestigations \n\nAbnormal liver function tests5 Very common \n\nBlood creatinine increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged Common \n1 Infections: urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, sepsis (<1%). \n2 Abdominal pain: abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper. \n3 Hepatotoxicity: hepatocellular injury, drug-induced liver injury (<1%), hepatotoxicity, hepatic \n\nfailure, autoimmune hepatitis (single case). \n4 Rash: rash, rash maculopapular, rash pruritic. \n5 Abnormal liver function tests: ALT increased, AST increased, blood bilirubin increased. \n\n* Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience. These are derived from \n\nspontaneous reports for which it is not always possible to reliably establish frequency or a causal \n\nrelationship to exposure to the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n\n \n\nNeutropenia \n\nNeutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse drug reaction (73.7%) and a grade 3 or 4 \n\ndecrease in neutrophil counts (based on laboratory findings) was reported in 58.6% of patients \n\nreceiving Kisqali plus any combination in the phase III studies. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nAmong the patients who had grade 2, 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to onset was 16 days, for \n\nthose patients who had an event. The median time to resolution of grade ≥3 (to normalisation or \n\ngrade <3) was 12 days in the Kisqali plus any combination arms following treatment interruption \n\nand/or reduction and/or discontinuation. Febrile neutropenia was reported in about 1.4% of patients \n\nexposed to Kisqali in the phase III studies. Patients should be instructed to report any fever promptly. \n\n \n\nBased on its severity, neutropenia was managed by laboratory monitoring, dose interruption and/or \n\ndose modification. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was low (0.8%) (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary toxicity \n\nIn the phase III clinical studies, hepatobiliary toxicity events occurred in a higher proportion of \n\npatients in the Kisqali plus any combination arms compared with the placebo plus any combination \n\narms (23.2% versus 16.5%, respectively), with more grade 3/4 adverse events reported in the patients \n\ntreated with Kisqali plus any combination (11.4% versus 5.4%, respectively). Increases in \n\ntransaminases were observed. Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (9.7% versus 1.5%) and AST (6.7% \n\nversus 2.1%) were reported in the Kisqali and placebo arms, respectively. Concurrent elevations in \n\nALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin greater than two \n\ntimes the upper limit of normal, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis \n\noccurred in 6 patients (4 patients in Study A2301 [MONALEESA-2], whose levels recovered to \n\nnormal within 154 days and 2 patients in Study F2301 [MONALEESA-3], whose levels recovered to \n\nnormal in 121 and 532 days, respectively, after discontinuation of Kisqali). There were no such cases \n\nreported in Study E2301 (MONALEESA-7). \n\n \n\nDose interruptions and/or adjustments due to hepatobiliary toxicity events were reported in 10.4% of \n\nKisqali plus any combination treated patients, primarily due to ALT increased (6.9%) and/or AST \n\nincreased (6.1%). Discontinuation of treatment with Kisqali plus any combination due to abnormal \n\nliver function tests or hepatotoxicity occurred in 2.3% and 0.4% of patients respectively (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the phase III clinical studies, 83.2% (89/107) of grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevation events occurred \n\nwithin the first 6 months of treatment. Among the patients who had grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation, \n\nthe median time to onset was 85 days for the Kisqali plus any combination arms. The median time to \n\nresolution (to normalisation or grade ≤2) was 22 days in the Kisqali plus any combination arms. \n\n \n\nQT prolongation \n\nIn study E2301 (MONALEESA-7), the observed mean QTcF increase from baseline was \n\napproximately 10 msec higher in the tamoxifen plus placebo subgroup compared with the NSAI plus \n\nplacebo subgroup, suggesting that tamoxifen alone had a QTcF prolongation effect which can \n\ncontribute to the QTcF values observed in the Kisqali plus tamoxifen group. In the placebo arm, a \n\nQTcF interval increase of >60 msec from baseline occurred in 6/90 (6.7%) patients receiving \n\ntamoxifen and in no patients receiving a NSAI (see section 5.2). A QTcF interval increase of \n\n>60 msec from baseline was observed in 14/87 (16.1%) patients receiving Kisqali plus tamoxifen and \n\nin 18/245 (7.3%) patients receiving Kisqali plus a NSAI. Kisqali is not recommended to be used in \n\ncombination with tamoxifen (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nIn the phase III clinical studies 8.4% of patients in the Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant \n\narms and 3.2% in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms had at least one event of QT \n\ninterval prolongation (including ECG QT prolonged and syncope). Review of ECG data showed \n\n14 patients (1.3%) had >500 msec post-baseline QTcF value, and 59 patients (5.6%) had a >60 msec \n\nincrease from baseline in QTcF intervals. There were no reported cases of torsade de pointes. Dose \n\ninterruptions/adjustments were reported in 2.3% of Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant \n\ntreated patients due to electrocardiogram QT prolonged and syncope. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe analysis of ECG data showed 52 patients (4.9%) and 11 patients (1.4%) with at least one \n\n>480 msec post-baseline QTcF for the Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms and the \n\nplacebo plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms, respectively. Amongst the patients who had \n\nQTcF prolongation >480 msec, the median time to onset was 15 days regardless of the combination \n\nand these changes were reversible with dose interruption and/or dose reduction (see sections 4.2, 4.4 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThere is only limited experience with reported cases of overdosage with Kisqali. In the event of an \n\noverdose, symptoms such as nausea and vomiting may occur. In addition, haematological (e.g. \n\nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia) toxicity and possible QTc prolongation may occur.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE42 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nRibociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, resulting in 50% \n\ninhibition (IC50) values of 0.01 (4.3 ng/ml) and 0.039 μM (16.9 ng/ml) in biochemical assays, \n\nrespectively. These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins and play a crucial role in \n\nsignalling pathways which lead to cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin \n\nD-CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma \n\nprotein (pRb). \n\n \n\nIn vitro, ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation, leading to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, \n\nand reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, treatment with single-agent ribociclib \n\nled to tumour regressions which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. \n\n \n\nIn vivo studies using patient-derived oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer xenograft model \n\ncombinations of ribociclib and antioestrogens (i.e. letrozole) resulted in superior tumour growth \n\ninhibition with sustained tumour regression and delayed tumour regrowth after stopping dosing \n\ncompared to each substance alone. Additionally, in vivo antitumour activity of ribociclib in \n\ncombination with fulvestrant was assessed in immune-deficient mice bearing the ZR751 ER+ human \n\nbreast cancer xenografts and the combination with fulvestrant resulted in complete tumour growth \n\ninhibition. \n\n \n\nWhen tested in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with known ER status, ribociclib demonstrated to be \n\nmore efficacious in ER+ breast cancer cell lines than in the ER- ones. In the preclinical models tested \n\nso far, intact pRb was required for ribociclib activity. \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nSerial, triplicate ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady state to evaluate the effect \n\nof ribociclib on the QTc interval in patients with advanced cancer. A \n\npharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis included a total of 997 patients treated with ribociclib at \n\ndoses ranging from 50 to 1200 mg. The analysis suggested that ribociclib causes \n\nconcentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval. The estimated QTcF mean change from \n\nbaseline for 600 mg Kisqali in combination with NSAI or fulvestrant was 22.0 msec (90% CI: 20.56, \n\n23.44) and 23.7 msec (90% CI: 22.31, 25.08), respectively at the geometric mean Cmax at steady-state \n\ncompared to 34.7 msec (90% CI: 31.64, 37.78) in combination with tamoxifen (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nStudy CLEE011A2301 (MONALEESA-2) \n\nKisqali was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III clinical \n\nstudy in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, \n\nadvanced breast cancer who received no prior therapy for advanced disease in combination with \n\nletrozole versus letrozole alone. \n\n \n\nA total of 668 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Kisqali 600 mg and letrozole \n\n(n=334) or placebo and letrozole (n=334), stratified according to the presence of liver and/or lung \n\nmetastases (Yes [n=292 (44%)]) versus No [n=376 (56%)]). Demographics and baseline disease \n\ncharacteristics were balanced and comparable between study arms. Kisqali was given orally at a dose \n\nof 600 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment in combination with \n\nletrozole 2.5 mg once daily for 28 days. Patients were not allowed to cross over from placebo to \n\nKisqali during the study or after progression of disease. \n\n \n\nPatients enrolled in this study had a median age of 62 years (range 23 to 91). 44.2% patients were \n\nolder than 65 years, including 69 patients older than 75 years. The patients included were Caucasian \n\n(82.2%), Asian (7.6%), and Black (2.5%). All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. In \n\nthe Kisqali arm 43.7% of patients had received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting \n\nand 52.4% had received antihormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting prior to study \n\nentry. 34.1% of patients were de novo. 20.7% of patients had bone-only disease and 59.0% of patients \n\nhad visceral disease. Patients with prior (neo)adjuvant therapy with anastrozole or letrozole must have \n\ncompleted this therapy at least 12 months before study randomisation. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint for the study was met at the planned interim analysis conducted after observing \n\n80% of targeted progression-free survival (PFS) events using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \n\nTumours (RECIST v1.1), based on the investigator assessment in the full population (all randomised \n\npatients), and confirmed by a blinded independent central radiological assessment. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients receiving \n\nKisqali plus letrozole compared to patients receiving placebo plus letrozole in the full analysis set \n\n(hazard ratio of 0.556, 95% CI: 0.429, 0.720, one sided stratified log-rank test p-value 0.00000329) \n\nwith clinically meaningful treatment effect. \n\n \n\nThe global health status/QoL data showed no relevant difference between the Kisqali plus letrozole \n\narm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. \n\n \n\nA more mature update of efficacy data (02 January 2017 cut-off) is provided in Tables 8 and 9. \n\n \n\nMedian PFS was 25.3 months (95% CI: 23.0, 30.3) for ribociclib plus letrozole treated patients and \n\n16.0 months (95% CI: 13.4, 18.2) for patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. 54.7% of patients \n\nreceiving ribociclib plus letrozole were estimated to be progression-free at 24 months compared with \n\n35.9% in the placebo plus letrozole arm. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThere was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the Kisqali plus \n\nletrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm (HR 0.746 [95% CI: 0.517, 1.078]).

No overall differences in \n\nsafety or effectiveness of Kisqali were observed between these patients and younger patients (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nKisqali in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of ribociclib were investigated in patients with advanced cancer following oral \n\ndaily doses of 50 mg to 1200 mg. Healthy subjects received single oral doses ranging from 400 mg to \n\n600 mg or repeated daily doses (8 days) at 400 mg. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of ribociclib is not known. \n \n\nThe time to reach Cmax (Tmax) following ribociclib oral administration was between 1 and 4 hours. \n\nRibociclib exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose \n\nrange tested (50 to 1200 mg). Following repeated once-daily dosing, steady state was generally \n\nachieved after 8 days and ribociclib accumulated with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 2.51 \n\n(range: 0.97 to 6.40). \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nCompared to the fasted state, oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ribociclib film-coated \n\ntablets with a high-fat, high-calorie meal had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of \n\nribociclib. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBinding of ribociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 70% and was independent \n\nof concentration (10 to 10000 ng/ml). Ribociclib was equally distributed between red blood cells and \n\nplasma with a mean in vivo blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.04. The apparent volume of distribution at \n\nsteady state (Vss/F) was 1090 L based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies indicated ribociclib is eliminated primarily via hepatic metabolism mainly \n\nvia CYP3A4 in humans. Following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of [14C] ribociclib to \n\nhumans, the primary metabolic pathways for ribociclib involved oxidation (dealkylation, C and/or \n\nN-oxygenation, oxidation (-2H)) and combinations thereof. Phase II conjugates of ribociclib phase I \n\nmetabolites involved N-acetylation, sulfation, cysteine conjugation, glycosylation and glucuronidation. \n\nRibociclib was the major circulating drug-derived entity in plasma. The major circulating metabolites \n\nincluded metabolite M13 (CCI284, N-hydroxylation), M4 (LEQ803, N-demethylation), and M1 \n\n(secondary glucuronide). Clinical activity (pharmacological and safety) of ribociclib was due primarily \n\nto parent drug, with negligible contribution from circulating metabolites. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n27 \n\nRibociclib was extensively metabolised, with unchanged drug accounting for 17.3% and 12.1% of the \n\ndose in faeces and urine, respectively. Metabolite LEQ803 was a significant metabolite in excreta and \n\nrepresented approximately 13.9% and 3.74% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \n\nrespectively. Numerous other metabolites were detected in both faeces and urine in minor amounts \n\n(≤2.78% of the administered dose). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe geometric mean plasma effective half-life (based on accumulation ratio) was 32.0 hours (63% \n\nCV) and the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 25.5 l/hr (66% CV) at steady state at \n\n600 mg in patients with advanced cancer. The geometric mean apparent plasma terminal half-life (T1/2) \n\nof ribociclib ranged from 29.7 to 54.7 hours and the geometric mean CL/F of ribociclib ranged from \n\n39.9 to 77.5 l/hr at 600 mg across studies in healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nRibociclib and its metabolites are eliminated mainly via faeces, with a small contribution of the renal \n\nroute. In 6 healthy male subjects, following a single oral dose of [14C] ribociclib, 91.7% of the total \n\nadministered radioactive dose was recovered within 22 days; faeces was the major route of excretion \n\n(69.1%), with 22.6% of the dose recovered in urine. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nRibociclib exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose \n\nrange of 50 mg to 1200 mg following both single dose and repeated doses. This analysis is limited by \n\nthe small sample sizes for most of the dose cohorts with a majority of the data coming from the \n\n600 mg dose cohort. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 77 patients with normal renal function \n\n(eGFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2), 76 patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to \n\n<90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 35 patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib \n\n(see section 4.2). The pharmacokinetics of ribociclib in breast cancer patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment have not been studied. \n \n\nThe effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib was also assessed in a renal \n\nimpairment study that included 7 healthy subjects with normal renal function (absolute GFR [aGFR] \n\n≥90 ml/min), 7 non-cancer subjects with severe renal impairment (aGFR 15 to <30 ml/min) and 3 non-\n\ncancer subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (aGFR <15 ml/min) at a single ribociclib dose of \n\n400 mg. In non-cancer subjects with severe renal impairment AUCinf increased 1.96-fold, and Cmax \n\nincreased 1.51-fold compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function (see section 4.2). Data in \n\nsubjects with ESRD are limited (n=3) but indicate a similar or somewhat larger increase in ribociclib \n\nexposure compared to subjects with severe renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on a pharmacokinetic study in non-cancer subjects with hepatic impairment, mild hepatic \n\nimpairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib (see section 4.2). The mean exposure for \n\nribociclib was increased less than 2-fold in patients with moderate (geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 1.44 \n\nfor Cmax; 1.28 for AUCinf) and severe (GMR: 1.32 for Cmax; 1.29 for AUCinf) hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 160 breast cancer patients with normal \n\nhepatic function and 47 patients with mild hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment had no effect \n\non the exposure of ribociclib, further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment \n\nstudy. Ribociclib has not been studied in breast cancer patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nEffect of age, weight, gender and race \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, body \n\nweight or gender on the systemic exposure of ribociclib that would require a dose adjustment. Data on \n\ndifferences in pharmacokinetics due to race are too limited to draw conclusions. \n \n\nIn vitro interaction data \n\n \n\nEffect of ribociclib on cytochrome P450 enzymes \n\nIn vitro, ribociclib is a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 and a time-dependent \n\ninhibitor of CYP3A4/5, at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro evaluations indicated that \n\nribociclib has no potential to inhibit the activities of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. Ribociclib has no potential for \n\ntime-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. \n\n \nIn vitro data indicate that ribociclib has no potential to induce UGT enzymes or the CYP enzymes \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 via PXR. Therefore, Kisqali is unlikely to affect substrates of these \n\nenzymes. In vitro data are not sufficient to exclude a potential of ribociclib to induce CYP2B6 via \n\nCAR. \n\n \n\nEffect of transporters on ribociclib \n\nRibociclib is a substrate for P-gp in vitro, but based on mass balance data inhibition of P-gp or BCRP \n\nis unlikely to affect ribociclib exposure at therapeutic doses. Ribociclib is not a substrate for hepatic \n\nuptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT-1 in vitro. \n\n \n\nEffect of ribociclib on transporters \n\nIn vitro evaluations indicated that ribociclib has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters \n\nP-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. Ribociclib did not inhibit OAT1, \n\nOAT3 or MRP2 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nSafety pharmacology \n\n \n\nIn vivo cardiac safety studies in dogs demonstrated dose and concentration related QTc interval \n\nprolongation at an exposure that would be expected to be achieved in patients following the \n\nrecommended dose of 600 mg. There is also potential to induce incidences of premature ventricular \n\ncontractions (PVCs) at elevated exposures (approximately 5-fold the anticipated clinical Cmax). \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies (treatment schedule of 3 weeks on/1 week off) of up to 27 weeks’ \n\nduration in rats and up to 39 weeks’ duration in dogs, revealed the hepatobiliary system (proliferative \n\nchanges, cholestasis, sand-like gallbladder calculi, and inspissated bile) as the primary target organ of \n\ntoxicity of ribociclib. Target organs associated with the pharmacological action of ribociclib in \n\nrepeat-dose studies include bone marrow (hypocellularity), lymphoid system (lymphoid depletion), \n\nintestinal mucosa (atrophy), skin (atrophy), bone (decreased bone formation), kidney (concurrent \n\ndegeneration and regeneration of tubular epithelial cells) and testes (atrophy). Besides the atrophic \n\nchanges seen in the testes, which showed a trend towards reversibility, all other changes were fully \n\nreversible after a 4-week treatment-free period. Exposure to ribociclib in animals in the toxicity \n\nstudies was generally less than or equal to that observed in patients receiving multiple doses of \n\n600 mg/day (based on AUC). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n\nReproductive toxicity/Fertility \n\n \n\nRibociclib showed foetotoxicity and teratogenicity at doses which did not show maternal toxicity in \n\nthe rats or rabbits. Following prenatal exposure, increased incidences of post-implantation loss and \n\nreduced foetal weights were observed in rats and ribociclib was teratogenic in rabbits at exposures \n\nlower than or 1.5 times the exposure in humans, respectively, at the highest recommended dose of \n\n600 mg/day based on AUC. \n\n \n\nIn rats, reduced foetal weights accompanied by skeletal changes considered to be transitory and/or \n\nrelated to the lower foetal weights were noted. In rabbits, there were adverse effects on embryo-foetal \n\ndevelopment as evidenced by increased incidences of foetal abnormalities (malformations and \n\nexternal, visceral and skeletal variants) and foetal growth (lower foetal weights). These findings \n\nincluded reduced/small lung lobes and additional vessel on the aortic arch and diaphragmatic hernia, \n\nabsent accessory lobe or (partly) fused lung lobes and reduced/small accessory lung lobe (30 and \n\n60 mg/kg), extra/rudimentary thirteenth ribs and misshapen hyoid bone and reduced number of \n\nphalanges in the pollex. There was no evidence of embryo-foetal mortality. \n\n \n\nIn a fertility study in female rats, ribociclib did not affect reproductive function, fertility or early \n\nembryonic development at any dose up to 300 mg/kg/day (which is likely at an exposure lower than or \n\nequal to patients’ clinical exposure at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC). \n\n \n\nRibociclib has not been evaluated in male fertility studies. However, atrophic changes in testes were \n\nreported in rat and dog toxicity studies at exposures that were less than or equal to human exposure at \n\nthe highest recommended daily dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC. These effects can be linked to a \n\ndirect anti-proliferative effects on the testicular germ cells resulting in atrophy of the seminiferous \n\ntubules. \n\n \n\nRibociclib and its metabolites passed readily into rat milk. The exposure to ribociclib was higher in \n\nmilk than in plasma. \n \n\nGenotoxicity \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with \n\nand without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a genotoxic potential of ribociclib. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Kisqali is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Kisqali is \nKisqali contains the active substance ribociclib, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\ncyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. \n\n \n\nWhat Kisqali is used for \nKisqali is used in women with a type of breast cancer called hormone receptor-positive, human \n\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer that is locally advanced or has spread to \n\nother parts of the body (metastatic). It is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or \n\nfulvestrant, which are used as hormonal anticancer therapies. \n\n \n\nWomen who have not reached menopause will also be treated with a medicine called a luteinising \n\nhormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. \n\n \n\nHow Kisqali works \nKisqali works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are important for \n\nthe growth and division of cells. Blocking these proteins can slow down the growth of cancer cells and \n\ndelay the progression of your cancer. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Kisqali works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Kisqali \n \n\nFollow all of your doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information in this \n\nleaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Kisqali: \n- if you are allergic to ribociclib, peanut, soya or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Kisqali. \n\n \n\nIf any of the following apply to you before taking Kisqali, tell your doctor or pharmacist: \n\n If you have a fever, sore throat or mouth ulcers due to infections (signs of a low level of white \nblood cells). \n\n If you have any problems with your liver or have previously had any type of liver disease. \n\n If you have or have had heart disorders or heart rhythm disorders, such as an irregular heartbeat, \nincluding a condition called prolonged QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation) or low levels of \n\npotassium, magnesium, calcium or phosphorus in your blood. \n\n \n\nIf any of the following apply to you during your treatment with Kisqali, tell your doctor or \n\npharmacist: \n\n If you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of the \nlips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms and enlarged lymph nodes \n\n(signs of a severe skin reaction). \n\nIn case of a severe skin reaction, your doctor will ask you to immediately stop treatment with \n\nKisqali. \n\n Trouble breathing, cough and shortness of breath (may be signs of lung or breathing problems). \nIf necessary, your doctor may interrupt or reduce your dose of Kisqali or decide to stop \n\ntreatment with Kisqali permanently. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during your treatment with Kisqali \nYou will have regular blood tests before and during treatment with Kisqali to check your liver function \n\nand the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) and electrolytes (blood \n\nsalts including potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate) in your body. Your heart activity will \n\nalso be monitored before and during treatment with Kisqali with a test called an electrocardiogram \n\n(ECG).

It may \n\nchange how Kisqali is processed in your body and may increase the amount of Kisqali in your \n\nbloodstream. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Kisqali during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and women of childbearing potential \n\nKisqali should not be used during pregnancy since it may harm your unborn baby.

How to take Kisqali \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse will tell you exactly how many tablets to take and which days to take them on. \n\nCheck with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Do not change the Kisqali dose or \n\nschedule without talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nDo not exceed the recommended dose prescribed by your doctor. \n\n \n\nHow much Kisqali to take \n\n The recommended starting dose of Kisqali is 600 mg (3 tablets of 200 mg) once daily. Your \ndoctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Kisqali to take; in certain situations your doctor \n\nmay instruct you to take a lower dose of Kisqali, e.g. 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) once daily or \n\n200 mg (1 tablet of 200 mg) once daily. \n\n A treatment cycle lasts 28 days. Take Kisqali once a day only on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. \nThe outer carton of the Kisqali pack includes a “calendar tool” which allows you to track your \n\ndaily Kisqali dose by marking off a circle for every tablet you take over the 28-day cycle. \n\nYou should not take Kisqali on days 22 to 28 of the cycle. \n\n \n\nIt is very important to follow your doctor’s instructions. If you get certain side effects your doctor may \n\nask you to take a lower dose, interrupt your treatment with Kisqali, or stop it permanently. \n\n \n\nWhen to take Kisqali \nTake Kisqali once daily at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. This will help you to \n\nremember to take your medicine. \n\n \n\nHow to take Kisqali \nKisqali tablets should be swallowed whole (tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split before \n\nswallowing). Do not take a tablet that is broken, cracked or otherwise damaged. \n\n \n\nKisqali with food and drink \n\nYou should take Kisqali once daily every day at the same time, preferably in the morning. You may \n\ntake it with or without food. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nHow long to take Kisqali \nTake Kisqali once a day on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Continue Kisqali treatment for as long as \n\nyour doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nThis is a long-term treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor \n\nyour condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Kisqali than you should \nIf you take too many tablets, or if someone else takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for \n\nadvice immediately. Show the Kisqali packet. Medical treatment may be necessary. \n\n \n\nIf you miss a dose of Kisqali \nIf you vomit after taking the dose or forget a dose, skip the missed dose that day. Take the next dose at \n\nyour usual time. \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Instead, wait until it is time for your next \n\ndose and then take your usual dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Kisqali \nStopping your treatment with Kisqali may cause your condition to get worse. Do not stop taking \n\nKisqali unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
