NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFabrazyme 35 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nFabrazyme 5 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nFabrazyme 35 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nEach vial of Fabrazyme contains a nominal value of 35 mg of agalsidase beta. After reconstitution \nwith 7.2 ml water for injections, each vial of Fabrazyme contains 5 mg/ml (35 mg/7 ml) of agalsidase \nbeta. The reconstituted solution must be diluted further (see section 6.6). \n \nFabrazyme 5 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nEach vial of Fabrazyme contains a nominal value of 5 mg of agalsidase beta. After reconstitution with \n1.1 ml water for injections, each vial of Fabrazyme contains 5 mg/ml of agalsidase beta. The \nreconstituted solution must be diluted further (see section 6.6). \n \nAgalsidase beta is a recombinant form of human \u03b1-galactosidase A and is produced by recombinant \nDNA technology using a mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture. The amino acid \nsequence of the recombinant form, as well as the nucleotide sequence which encoded it, are identical \nto the natural form of \u03b1-galactosidase A. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nWhite to off-white lyophilised cake or powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFabrazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed \ndiagnosis of Fabry disease (\u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency).  \n \nFabrazyme is indicated in adults, children and adolescents aged 8 years and older. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFabrazyme treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients \nwith Fabry disease or other inherited metabolic diseases. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Fabrazyme is 1 mg/kg body weight administered once every 2 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion.  \n \nLower dosing regimens have been used in clinical studies. In one of these studies, performed in adult \nmale patients, after an initial dose of 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 6 months, 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks \nmay maintain clearance of GL-3 in certain cell types in some patients; however, the long term clinical \nrelevance of these findings has not been established (see section 5.1). \n \nThe initial infusion rate should be no more than 0.25 mg/min (15 mg/hour) to minimise the potential \noccurrence of infusion-associated reactions. After patient tolerance is established, the infusion rate \nmay be increased gradually with subsequent infusions. \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n \nInfusion of Fabrazyme at home may be considered for patients who are tolerating their infusions well. \nThe decision to have a patient move to home infusion should be made after evaluation and \nrecommendation by the treating physician. Patients experiencing adverse events during the home \ninfusion need to immediately stop the infusion process and seek the attention of a healthcare \nprofessional. Subsequent infusions may need to occur in a clinical setting. Dose and infusion rate \nshould remain constant while at home, and not be changed without supervision of a healthcare \nprofessional. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal insufficiency.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nStudies in patients with hepatic insufficiency have not been performed. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in patients older than 65 years have not been established and no \ndosage regimen can presently be recommended in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in children aged 0 to7 years have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on posology can \nbe made in children aged 5 to 7 years. No data are available in children 0 to 4 years \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for children 8-16 years \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nLife threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance or any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nImmunogenicity \nSince agalsidase beta (r-h\u03b1GAL) is a recombinant protein, the development of IgG antibodies is \nexpected in patients with little or no residual enzyme activity. The majority of patients developed IgG \nantibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL, typically within 3 months of the first infusion with Fabrazyme. Over time, the \nmajority of seropositive patients in clinical trials demonstrated either a downward trend in titers \n(based on a \u2265 4-fold reduction in titer from the peak measurement to the last measurement) (40% of \nthe patients), tolerised (no detectable antibodies confirmed by 2 consecutive radioimmuno-\nprecipitation (RIP) assays) (14% of the patients) or demonstrated a plateau (35% of the patients). \n \nInfusion associated reactions \nPatients with antibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL have a greater potential to experience infusion-associated \nreactions (IARs), which are defined as any related adverse event occurring on the infusion day. These \npatients should be treated with caution when re-administering agalsidase beta (see section 4.8). \nAntibody status should be regularly monitored. \n \nIn clinical trials, sixty seven percent (67 %) of the patients experienced at least one infusion-\nassociated reaction (see section 4.8). The frequency of IARs decreased over time. Patients \nexperiencing mild or moderate infusion-associated reactions when treated with agalsidase beta during \nclinical trials have continued therapy after a reduction in the infusion rate (~0.15 mg/min; 10 mg/hr) \nand/or pre-treatment with antihistamines, paracetamol, ibuprofen and/or corticosteroids. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nHypersensitivity \nAs with any intravenous protein medicinal product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are \npossible. \n \nA small number of patients have experienced reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) \nhypersensitivity. If severe allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of \nthe administration of Fabrazyme should be considered and appropriate treatment initiated. The current \nmedical standards for emergency treatment are to be observed. With careful rechallenge Fabrazyme \nhas been re-administered to all 6 patients who tested positive for IgE antibodies or had a positive skin \ntest to Fabrazyme in a clinical trial. In this trial, the initial rechallenge administration was at a low \ndose and a lower infusion rate (1/2 the therapeutic dose at 1/25 the initial standard recommended rate). \nOnce a patient tolerates the infusion, the dose may be increased to reach the therapeutic dose of \n1 mg/kg and the infusion rate may be increased by slowly titrating upwards, as tolerated. \n \nPatients with advanced renal disease \nThe effect of Fabrazyme treatment on the kidneys may be limited in patients with advanced renal \ndisease. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies and no in vitro metabolism studies have been performed. Based on its \nmetabolism, agalsidase beta is an unlikely candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug \ninteractions. \n \nFabrazyme should not be administered with chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or gentamycin due to \na theoretical risk of inhibition of intra-cellular \u03b1-galactosidase A activity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of agalsidase beta in pregnant women.  \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nFabrazyme should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAgalsidase beta may be excreted in milk. Because there are no data available on effects in neonates \nexposed to agalsidase beta via breast milk, it is recommended to stop breast-feeding when Fabrazyme \nis used. \n \nFertility \nStudies have not been conducted to assess the potential effects of Fabrazyme on impairment of \nfertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFabrazyme may have a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines on the day of \nFabrazyme administration because dizziness, somnolence, vertigo and syncope may occur (see section \n4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nSince agalsidase beta (r-h\u03b1GAL) is a recombinant protein, the development of IgG antibodies is \nexpected in patients with little or no residual enzyme activity. Patients with antibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL \nhave a greater potential to experience infusion-associated reactions (IARs). Reactions suggestive of \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nimmediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of patients (see section \n4.4).  \n \nVery common adverse reactions included chills, pyrexia, feeling cold, nausea, vomiting, headache and \nparaesthesia. Sixty seven percent (67%) of the patients experienced at least one infusion-associated \nreaction. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in the postmarketing setting.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported from clinical trials with a total of 168 patients (154 males and 14 females) \ntreated with Fabrazyme administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks for a minimum of one \ninfusion up to a maximum of 5 years are listed by System Organ Class and frequency (very common \n\u2265 1/10; common \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10 and uncommon \u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100) in the table below. The \noccurrence of an adverse reaction in a single patient is defined as uncommon in light of the relatively \nsmall number of patients treated. Adverse reactions only reported during the Post Marketing period \nare also included in the table below at a frequency category of \u201cnot known\u201d (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity: \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nIncidence of adverse reactions with Fabrazyme treatment \nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations  \n\n--- nasopharyngitis rhinitis  \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n--- --- --- anaphylactoid \nreaction \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache, \nparaesthesia \n\ndizziness, somnolence, \nhypoaesthesia, burning \nsensation, lethargy, \nsyncope \n\nhyperaesthesia, \ntremor \n\n--- \n\nEye disorders --- lacrimation increased eye pruritus, ocular \nhyperaemia \n\n--- \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n--- tinnitus, vertigo auricular swelling, \near pain \n\n--- \n\nCardiac \nDisorders \n\n--- tachycardia, \npalpitations, bradycardia \n\nsinus bradycardia --- \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n--- flushing, hypertension, \npallor, hypotension, hot \nflush \n\nperipheral coldness  --- \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n--- dyspnoea, nasal \ncongestion, throat \ntightness, wheezing, \ncough, dyspnoea \nexacerbated \n\nbronchospasm, \npharyngolaryngeal \npain, rhinnorhoea, \ntachypnoea, upper \nrespiratory tract \ncongestion \n\n hypoxia \n\nGastrointestinal \nDisorders \n\nnausea, vomiting abdominal pain, \nabdominal pain upper, \nabdominal discomfort, \nstomach discomfort, \nhypoaesthesia oral, \ndiarrhoea \n\ndyspepsia, dysphagia  --- \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n--- pruritus, urticaria, rash, \nerythema, pruritus \ngeneralized, \nangioneurotic oedema, \nswelling face, rash \nmaculo-papular \n\nlivedo reticularis, \nrash erythematous, \nrash pruritic, skin \ndiscolouration, skin \ndiscomfort \n\nleukocytoclastic \nvasculitis \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n--- pain in extremity, \nmyalgia, back pain, \nmuscle spasms, \narthralgia, muscle \ntightness, \nmusculoskeletal \nstiffness \n\nmusculoskeletal pain  --- \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nchills, pyrexia, \nfeeling cold \n\nfatigue, chest \ndiscomfort, feeling hot, \noedema peripheral, pain, \nasthenia, chest pain, face \noedema, hyperthermia \n\nfeeling hot and cold, \ninfluenza-like illness, \ninfusion site pain, \ninfusion site reaction, \ninjection site \nthrombosis, malaise, \noedema \n\n --- \n\nInvestigations    oxygen saturation \ndecreased \n\nFor the purpose of this table, \u22651% is defined as reactions occurring in 2 or more patients. \nAdverse reaction terminology is based upon the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nInfusion associated reactions \nInfusion associated reactions consisted most often of fever and chills. Additional symptoms included \nmild or moderate dyspnoea, hypoxia (oxygen saturation decreased), throat tightness, chest discomfort, \nflushing, pruritus, urticaria, face oedema, angioneurotic oedema, rhinitis, bronchospasm, tachypnoea, \nwheezing, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ninfusion-related pain including pain at the extremities, myalgia, and headache. \n \nThe infusion-associated reactions were managed by a reduction in the infusion rate together with the \nadministration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, antihistamines and/or \ncorticosteroids. Sixty seven percent (67%) of the patients experienced at least one infusion-associated \nreaction. The frequency of these reactions decreased over time. The majority of these reactions can be \nattributed to the formation of IgG antibodies and/or complement activation. In a limited number of \npatients IgE antibodies were demonstrated (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nLimited information from clinical trials suggests that the safety profile of Fabrazyme treatment in \npaediatric patients ages 5-7, treated with either 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks \nis similar to that of patients (above the age of 7) treated at 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials doses up to 3 mg/kg body weight were used. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes. ATC code: \nA16AB04.  \n \nFabry disease \nFabry disease is an inherited heterogeneous and multisystemic progressive disease, that affects both \nmales and females. It is characterised by the deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase. Reduced or absent \u03b1-\ngalactosidase activity results in the accumulation of GL-3 in the lysosomes of many cell types \nincluding the endothelial and parenchymal cells, ultimately leading to life-threatening clinical \ndeteriorations as a result of renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular complications.  \n \nMechanism of action \nThe rationale for enzyme replacement therapy is to restore a level of enzymatic activity sufficient to \nclear the accumulating substrate in the organ tissues; thereby, preventing, stabilizing or reversing the \nprogressive decline in function of these organs before irreversible damage has occurred. \n \nAfter intravenous infusion, agalsidase beta is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by \nvascular endothelial and parenchymal cells into lysosomes, likely through the mannose-6 phosphate, \nmannose and asialoglycoprotein receptors. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nEfficacy and safety of Fabrazyme was evaluated in two studies with children, one dose-finding study, \ntwo double-blind placebo-controlled studies, and one open-label extension study in both male and \nfemale patients. \n \nIn the dose finding study, the effects of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg once every 2 weeks and 1.0 and \n3.0 mg/kg once every 2 days were evaluated. A reduction in GL-3 was observed in kidney, heart, skin \nand plasma at all doses. Plasma GL-3 was cleared in a dose dependent manner, but was less consistent \nat the dose of 0.3 mg/kg. In addition, infusion-associated reactions were dose dependent. \n \nIn the first placebo-controlled clinical trial, Fabrazyme was effective in clearing GL-3 from the \nvascular endothelium of the kidney after 20 weeks of treatment. This clearance was achieved in 69% \n(20/29) of the Fabrazyme treated patients, but in none of the placebo patients (p<0.001). This finding \nwas further supported by a statistically significant decrease in GL-3 inclusions in kidney, heart and \nskin combined and in the individual organs in patients treated with agalsidase beta compared to \nplacebo patients (p<0.001). Sustained clearance of GL-3 from kidney vascular endothelium upon \nagalsidase beta treatment was demonstrated further in the open label extension of this trial. This was \nachieved in 47 of the 49 patients (96%) with available information at month 6, and in 8 of the \n8 patients (100%) with available information at the end of the study (up to a total of 5 years of \ntreatment). Clearance of GL-3 was also achieved in several other cell types from the kidney. Plasma \nGL-3 levels rapidly normalised with treatment and remained normal through 5 years. \n \nRenal function, as measured by glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine, as well as proteinuria, \nremained stable in the majority of the patients. However, the effect of Fabrazyme treatment on the \nkidney function was limited in some patients with advanced renal disease. \n \nAlthough no specific study has been conducted to assess the effect on the neurological signs and \nsymptoms, the results also indicate that patients may achieve reduced pain and enhanced quality of \nlife upon enzyme replacement therapy.  \n \nAnother double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 82 patients was performed to determine whether \nFabrazyme would reduce the rate of occurrence of renal, cardiac, or cerebrovascular disease or death. \nThe rate of clinical events was substantially lower among Fabrazyme-treated patients compared to \nplacebo-treated patients (risk reduction = 53% intent-to-treat population (p=0.0577); risk reduction = \n61 % per-protocol population (p=0.0341)). This result was consistent across renal, cardiac and \ncerebrovascular events.  \n \nThe results of these studies indicate that Fabrazyme treatment at 1 mg/kg every other week provides \nclinical benefit on key clinical outcomes in patients with early and advanced Fabry disease. Because \nthis condition is slowly progressive, early detection and treatment is critical to achieve the best \noutcomes. \n \nIn an additional study, 21 male patients were enrolled to follow GL3 clearance in kidney and skin \ntissues at an alternative dosing regimen. Following treatment with 1 mg/kg every other week for \n24 weeks, a dose regimen of 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 18 months was able to maintain the \nclearance of cellular GL-3 in the capillary endothelium of the kidney, other kidney cell types and skin \n(superficial skin capillary endothelium) in the majority of patients. However, at the lower dose, IgG \nantibodies may play a role with respect to GL-3 clearance in some patients. Due to the limitations of \nthe study design (small number of patients), no definitive conclusion regarding the dose maintenance \nregimen can be drawn, but these findings suggest that, after an initial debulking dose of 1.0 mg/kg \nevery 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks may be sufficient in some patients to maintain clearance of \nGL-3. \n \nIn the postmarketing setting, experience was gained in patients who initiated treatment at a dose of \n1 mg/kg every 2 weeks and subsequently received a reduced dose for an extended period. In some of \nthese patients, an increase of some of the following symptoms was spontaneously reported: pain, \nparaesthesia and diarrhoea, as well as cardiac, central nervous system and renal manifestations. These \nreported symptoms resemble the natural course of Fabry disease. \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nIn one open-label paediatric study, sixteen patients with Fabry disease (8-16 years old; 14 males, \n2 females) had been treated for one year at 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Clearance of GL-3 in the \nsuperficial skin vascular endothelium was achieved in all patients who had accumulated GL-3 at \nbaseline. The 2 female patients had little or no GL-3 accumulation in the superficial skin vascular \nendothelium at baseline, making this conclusion applicable in male patients only. \n \nIn an additional 5-year open-label paediatric study,  31 male patients aged 5 to 18 years were \nrandomized prior to the onset of clinical symptoms involving major organs and treated with two lower \ndose regimens of agalsidase beta, 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Results were \nsimilar between the two treatment groups. Superficial skin capillary endothelium GL-3 scores were \nreduced to zero or maintained at zero at all time points post-baseline upon treatment in 19/27 patients \ncompleting the study without a dose increase. Both baseline and 5-year kidney biopsies were obtained \nin a subset of 6 patients: in all, kidney capillary endothelium GL-3 scores were reduced to zero but \nhighly variable effects were observed in podocyte GL-3, with a reduction in 3 patients. Ten (10) \npatients met per protocol dose increase criteria, two (2) had a dose increase to the recommended dose \nof 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing an intravenous administration of agalsidase beta to adults at doses of 0.3 mg, 1 mg and \n3 mg/kg body weight, the AUC values increased more than dose proportional, due to a decrease in \nclearance, indicating a saturated clearance. The elimination half-life was dose independent and ranged \nfrom 45 to 100 minutes. \n \nAfter intravenous administration of agalsidase beta to adults with an infusion time of approximately \n300 minutes and at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight, biweekly, mean Cmax plasma concentrations   \nranged from 2000-3500 ng/ml, while the AUCinf ranged from 370-780 \u00b5g min/ml. Vss ranged from \n8.3-40.8 l, plasma clearance from 119-345 ml/min and the mean elimination half-life from \n80-120 minutes.  \n \nAgalsidase beta is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis. \nConsequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of agalsidase \nbeta in a clinically significant way. Renal elimination of agalsidase beta is considered to be a minor \npathway for clearance. \n \nPaediatric population \nFabrazyme pharmacokinetics was also evaluated in two paediatric studies. In one of these studies, 15 \npaediatric patients with available pharmacokinetics data, aged 8.5 to 16 years weighing 27.1 to 64.9 \nkg were treated with 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Agalsidase beta clearance was not influenced by \nweight in this population. Baseline CL was 77 ml/min with a Vss of 2.6 l; half-life was 55 min. After \nIgG seroconversion, CL decreased to 35 ml/min, Vss increased to 5.4 l, and half-life increased to 240 \nmin. The net effect of these changes after seroconversion was an increase in exposure of 2- to 3-fold \nbased on AUC and Cmax. No unexpected safety issues were encountered in patients with an increase in \nexposure after seroconversion. \nIn another study with 30 paediatric patients with available pharmacokinetics data, aged 5 to 18 years, \ntreated with two lower dose regimens of 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks, mean \nCL was 4.6 and 2.3 ml/min/kg, respectively, mean Vss was 0.27 and 0.22 l/kg, respectively, and mean \nelimination half-life was 88 and 107 minutes, respectively. After IgG seroconversion, there was no \napparent change in CL (+24% and +6%, resp.), while Vss was 1.8 and 2.2 fold higher, with the net \neffect being a small decrease in Cmax (up to -34% and -11%, resp.) and no change in AUC (-19% and -\n6%, resp.).  \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, single \ndose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity and embryonal/foetal toxicity. Studies with regard to other stages \nof the development have not been carried out. Genotoxic and carcinogenic potential are not expected. \n \n \n6.

Use Aseptic Technique  \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nDetermine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient\u2019s weight and remove \nthe required vials from the refrigerator in order to allow them to reach room temperature (in \napproximately 30 minutes). Each vial of Fabrazyme is intended for single use only. \n \nReconstitution  \n \nFabrazyme 35 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nReconstitute each vial of Fabrazyme 35 mg with 7.2 ml water for injections. Avoid forceful impact of \nthe water for injections on the powder and avoid foaming. This is done by slow drop-wise addition of \nthe water for injection down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilized cake. Roll and \ntilt each vial gently. Do not invert, swirl or shake the vial. \n \nFabrazyme 5 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nReconstitute each vial of Fabrazyme 5 mg with 1.1 ml water for injections. Avoid forceful impact of \nthe water for injections on the powder and avoid foaming. This is done by slow drop-wise addition of \nthe water for injection down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilized cake. Roll and \ntilt each vial gently. Do not invert, swirl or shake the vial.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution contains 5 mg agalsidase beta per ml, and appears as a clear colourless \nsolution. The pH of the reconstituted solution is approximately 7.0. Before further dilution, visually \ninspect the reconstituted solution in each vial for particulate matter and discoloration. Do not use the \nsolution if foreign particles are observed or if the solution is discoloured. \n \nAfter reconstitution it is recommended to promptly dilute the vials, to minimise protein particle \nformation over time. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nDilution \n \nFabrazyme 35 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nPrior to adding the reconstituted volume of Fabrazyme required for the patient dose, it is \nrecommended to remove an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution, from the \ninfusion bag. \n \nRemove the airspace within the infusion bag to minimize the air/liquid interface. \n \nSlowly, withdraw 7.0 ml (equal to 35 mg) of the reconstituted solution from each vial up to the total \nvolume required for the patient dose. Do not use filter needles and avoid foaming. \n \nThen slowly inject the reconstituted solution directly into the 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous \nsolution (not in any remaining airspace) to a final concentration between 0.05 mg/ml and 0.7 mg/ml. \nDetermine the total volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for infusion (between 50 and 500 ml) \nbased on the individual dose. For doses lower than 35 mg use a minimum of 50 ml, for doses 35 to \n70 mg use a minimum of 100 ml, for doses 70 to 100 mg use a minimum of 250 ml and for doses \ngreater than 100 mg use only 500 ml. Gently invert or lightly massage the infusion bag to mix the \ndiluted solution. Do not shake or excessively agitate the infusion bag. \n \nFabrazyme 5 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nPrior to adding the reconstituted volume of Fabrazyme required for the patient dose, it is \nrecommended to remove an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution, from the \ninfusion bag. \n \nRemove the airspace within the infusion bag to minimize the air/liquid interface.  \n \nSlowly, withdraw 1.0 ml (equal to 5 mg) of the reconstituted solution from each vial up to the total \nvolume required for the patient dose. Do not use filter needles and avoid foaming. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \nThen slowly inject the reconstituted solution directly into the 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous \nsolution (not in any remaining airspace) to a final concentration between 0.05 mg/ml and 0.7 mg/ml. \nDetermine the total volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for infusion (between 50 and 500 ml) \nbased on the individual dose. For doses lower than 35 mg use a minimum of 50 ml, for doses 35 to \n70 mg use a minimum of 100 ml, for doses 70 to 100 mg use a minimum of 250 ml and for doses \ngreater than 100 mg use only 500 ml. Gently invert or lightly massage the infusion bag to mix the \ndiluted solution. Do not shake or excessively agitate the infusion bag. \n \nAdministration \n \nIt is recommended to administer the diluted solution through an in-line low protein-binding 0.2 \u00b5m \nfilter to remove any protein particles which will not lead to any loss of agalsidase beta activity. The \ninitial infusion rate should be no more than 0.25 mg/min (15 mg/hour) to minimise the potential \noccurrence of infusion-associated reactions. After patient tolerance is established, the infusion rate \nmay be increased gradually with subsequent infusions. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET  \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nFabrazyme 35 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nAgalsidase beta \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Fabrazyme is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Fabrazyme \n3. How to use Fabrazyme \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fabrazyme  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fabrazyme is and what it is used for \n \nFabrazyme contains the active substance agalsidase beta and is used as enzyme replacement therapy \nin Fabry disease, where the level of \u03b1-galactosidase enzyme activity is absent or lower than normal. If \nyou suffer from Fabry disease a fat substance, called globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), is not removed \nfrom the cells of your body and starts to accumulate in the walls of the blood vessels of your organs. \n \nFabrazyme is indicated for use as long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed \ndiagnosis of Fabry disease. \n \nFabrazyme is indicated in adults, children and adolescents aged 8 years and older. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fabrazyme \n \nDo not use Fabrazyme \n- if you are allergic to agalsidase beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor  or pharmacist before using Fabrazyme. \n \nIf you are treated with Fabrazyme, you may develop infusion associated reactions. An infusion-\nassociated reaction is any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day \n(see section 4). If you experience a reaction like this, you should tell your doctor immediately. You \nmay need to be given additional medicines to prevent such reactions from occurring. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNo clinical studies have been performed in children 0-4 years old. The risks and benefits of \nFabrazyme in children  aged 5 to 7 years have not yet been established and therefore no dose can be \nrecommended for this age group. \n \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nOther medicines and Fabrazyme \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nTell your doctor if you use any medicines containing chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or \ngentamicin. There is a theoretical risk of decreased agalsidase beta activity.   \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nUse of Fabrazyme during pregnancy is not recommended. There is no experience with the use of \nFabrazyme in pregnant women. Fabrazyme may get into breast milk. Use of Fabrazyme during breast-\nfeeding is not recommended. Studies have not been performed to examine the effects of Fabrazyme \non fertility. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines if you experience dizziness, sleepiness, vertigo or fainting during or \nshortly after administration of Fabrazyme (see section 4). Talk to your doctor first. \n \n \n3. How to use Fabrazyme \n \nFabrazyme is given through a drip into a vein (by intravenous infusion). It is supplied as a powder \nwhich will be mixed with sterile water before it is given (see information for Health Care \nProfessionals at the end of this leaflet). \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nFabrazyme is only used under the supervision of a doctor who is knowledgeable in the treatment of \nFabry disease. Your doctor may advise that you can be treated at home provided you meet certain \ncriteria. Please contact your doctor if you would like to be treated at home. \n \nThe recommended dose of Fabrazyme for adults is 1 mg/kg body weight, once every 2 weeks. No \nchanges in dose are necessary for patients with kidney disease.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe recommended dose of Fabrazyme for children and adolescents 8 \u2013 16 years is 1 mg/kg body \nweight, once every 2 weeks. No changes in dose are necessary for patients with kidney disease.  \n \nIf you use more Fabrazyme than you should \nDoses up to 3 mg/kg body weight have shown to be safe. \n \nIf you forget to use Fabrazyme \nIf you have missed an infusion of Fabrazyme, please contact your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn clinical studies side effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or \nshortly after (\u201cinfusion related reactions\u201d). Severe life-threatening allergic reactions (\u201canaphylactoid \nreactions\u201d) have been reported in some patients. If you experience any serious side effect, you should \ncontact your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nVery common symptoms (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include chills, fever, feeling cold, \nnausea, vomiting, headache and abnormal feelings in the skin such as burning or tingling. Your doctor \nmay decide to lower the infusion rate or give you additional medicines to prevent such reactions from \noccurring. \n \nList of other side effects: \n   \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n\u2022 chest pain \u2022 sleepiness \u2022 fatigue \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing \u2022 increased heart beat \u2022 flushing \n\u2022 pallor \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 pain \n\u2022 itching \u2022 back pain \u2022 throat tightness \n\u2022 abnormal tear secretion \u2022 rash \u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 feeling weak \u2022 low heart rate \u2022 palpitations \n\u2022 tinnitus \u2022 lethargy \u2022 decreased sensitivity to pain \n\u2022 nasal congestion \u2022 syncope \u2022 burning sensation \n\u2022 diarrhoea \u2022 cough \u2022 wheezing \n\u2022 redness \u2022 abdominal discomfort \u2022 urticaria \n\u2022 muscle pain \u2022 swelling face \u2022 pain at the extremities \n\u2022 increased blood pressure \u2022 joint pain \u2022 nasopharyngitis \n\u2022 sudden swelling of the face \n\nor throat \n\u2022 decreased blood pressure \u2022 hot flush \n\n\u2022 oedema in extremities \u2022 chest discomfort \u2022 feeling hot  \n\u2022 vertigo \u2022 face oedema  \u2022 hyperthermia \n\u2022 stomach discomfort \u2022 exacerbated difficulty in \n\nbreathing \n\u2022 decreased mouth sensitivity \n\n\u2022 muscle spasms \u2022 muscle tightness \u2022 musculoskeletal stiffness \n   \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 tremor \u2022 itching eyes \u2022 low heart rate due to conduction \n\ndisturbances \n\u2022 red eyes \u2022 ear swelling \u2022 increased sensitivity to pain \n\u2022 ear pain \u2022 bronchospasm \u2022 upper respiratory tract congestion \n\u2022 throat pain \u2022 runny nose \u2022 red rash \n\u2022 fast breathing \u2022 heart burn \u2022 (mottled purplish) skin discoloration \n\u2022 itchy rash \u2022 skin discomfort \u2022 coldness of the extremities \n\u2022 feeling hot and cold \u2022 musculoskeletal pain \u2022 injection site blood clotting \n\u2022 difficulty swallowing \u2022 rhinitis \u2022 skin discoloration \n\u2022 infusion site pain \u2022 influenza-like illness \u2022 oedema \n\u2022 infusion site reaction \u2022 malaise  \n   \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\u2022 lower blood oxygen levels \u2022 serious inflammation of the \n\nvessels \n \n\n \nIn some patients initially treated at the recommended dose, and whose dose was later reduced for an \nextended period, some symptoms of Fabry disease were reported more frequently. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage and conditions are the responsibility of the user. The reconstituted \nsolution cannot be stored and should be promptly diluted; only the diluted solution can be held for up \nto 24 hours at 2\u00baC -8\u00baC.  \n \nUse Aseptic Technique  \n \n1. Determine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient's weight and \n\nremove the required vials from the refrigerator in order to allow them to reach room \ntemperature (in approximately 30 minutes). Each vial of Fabrazyme is intended for single use \nonly. \n\n \nReconstitution  \n \n2. Reconstitute each vial of Fabrazyme 35 mg with 7.2 ml water for injections. Avoid forceful \n\nimpact of the water for injections on the powder and avoid foaming. This is done by slow drop-\nwise addition of the water for injection down the inside of the vial and not directly onto the \nlyophilized cake. Roll and tilt each vial gently. Do not invert, swirl or shake the vial.  \n\n \n3. The reconstituted solution contains 5 mg agalsidase beta per ml, and appears as a clear \n\ncolourless solution. The pH of the reconstituted solution is approximately 7.0. Before further \ndilution, visually inspect the reconstituted solution in each vial for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration. Do not use the solution if foreign particles are observed or if the solution is \ndiscoloured. \n\n \n4. After reconstitution it is recommended to promptly dilute the vials, to minimise protein particle \n\nformation over time. \n \n5. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n 31 \n\nDilution  \n \n6. Prior to adding the reconstituted volume of Fabrazyme required for the patient dose, it is \n\nrecommended to remove an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution, from \nthe infusion bag. \n\n \n7. Remove the airspace within the infusion bag to minimize the air/liquid interface.  \n \n8. Slowly, withdraw 7.0 ml (equal to 35 mg) of the reconstituted solution from each vial up to the \n\ntotal volume required for the patient dose. Do not use filter needles and avoid foaming. \n \n9. Then slowly inject the reconstituted solution directly into the 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous \n\nsolution (not in any remaining airspace) to a final concentration between 0.05 mg/ml and \n0.7 mg/ml. Determine the total volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for infusion (between \n50 and 500 ml) based on the individual dose. For doses lower than 35 mg use a minimum of \n50 ml, for doses 35 to 70 mg use a minimum of 100 ml, for doses 70 to 100 mg use a minimum \nof 250 ml and for doses greater than 100 mg use only 500 ml. Gently invert or lightly massage \nthe infusion bag to mix the diluted solution. Do not shake or excessively agitate the infusion \nbag. \n\n \nAdministration \n \n10. It is recommended to administer the diluted solution through an in-line low protein-binding \n\n0.2 \u00b5m filter to remove any protein particles which will not lead to any loss of agalsidase beta \nactivity. The initial infusion rate should be no more than 0.25 mg/min (15 mg/hour) to \nminimise the potential occurrence of infusion-associated reactions. After patient tolerance is \nestablished, the infusion rate may be increased gradually with subsequent infusions. \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nFabrazyme 5 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nAgalsidase beta \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you use Fabrazyme \n3. How to use Fabrazyme \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fabrazyme \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fabrazyme is and what it is used for \n \nFabrazyme contains the active substance agalsidase beta and is used as enzyme replacement therapy \nin Fabry disease, where the level of \u03b1-galactosidase enzyme activity is absent or lower than normal. If \nyou suffer from Fabry disease a fat substance, called globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), is not removed \nfrom the cells of your body and starts to accumulate in the walls of the blood vessels of your organs. \n \nFabrazyme is indicated for use as long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed \ndiagnosis of Fabry disease. \n \nFabrazyme is indicated in adults, children and adolescents aged 8 years and older. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fabrazyme \n \nDo not use Fabrazyme \n- if you are allergic to agalsidase beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor  or pharmacist before using Fabrazyme. \n \nIf you are treated with Fabrazyme, you may develop infusion associated reactions. An infusion-\nassociated reaction is any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day \n(see section 4). If you experience a reaction like this, you should tell your doctor immediately. You \nmay need to be given additional medicines to prevent such reactions from occurring. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNo clinical studies have been performed in children 0-4 years old. The risks and benefits of \nFabrazyme in children  aged 5 to 7 years have not yet been established and therefore no dose can be \nrecommended for this age group. \n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nOther medicines and Fabrazyme \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nTell your doctor if you use any medicines containing chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or \ngentamicin. There is a theoretical risk of decreased agalsidase beta activity.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nUse of Fabrazyme during pregnancy is not recommended. There is no experience with the use of \nFabrazyme in pregnant women. Fabrazyme may get into breast milk. Use of Fabrazyme during breast-\nfeeding is not recommended. Studies have not been performed to examine the effects of Fabrazyme \non fertility.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines if you experience dizziness, sleepiness, vertigo or fainting during or \nshortly after administration of Fabrazyme (see section 4). Talk to your doctor first. \n \n \n3. How to use Fabrazyme \n \nFabrazyme is given through a drip into a vein (by intravenous infusion). It is supplied as a powder \nwhich will be mixed with sterile water before it is given (see information for Health Care \nProfessionals at the end of this leaflet). \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nFabrazyme is only used under the supervision of a doctor who is knowledgeable in the treatment of \nFabry disease. Your doctor may advise that you can be treated at home provided you meet certain \ncriteria. Please contact your doctor if you would like to be treated at home. \n \nThe recommended dose of Fabrazyme for adults is 1 mg/kg body weight, once every 2 weeks. No \nchanges in dose are necessary for patients with kidney disease.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe recommended dose of Fabrazyme for children and adolescents 8 \u2013 16 years is 1 mg/kg body \nweight, once every 2 weeks. No changes in dose are necessary for patients with kidney disease. \n \nIf you use more Fabrazyme than you should \nDoses up to 3 mg/kg body weight have shown to be safe. \n \nIf you forget to use Fabrazyme \nIf you have missed an infusion of Fabrazyme, please contact your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn clinical studies side effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or \nshortly after (\u201cinfusion related reactions\u201d). Severe life-threatening allergic reactions (\u201canaphylactoid \nreactions\u201d) have been reported in some patients. If you experience any serious side effect, you should \ncontact your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nVery common symptoms (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include chills, fever, feeling cold, \nnausea, vomiting, headache and abnormal feelings in the skin such as burning or tingling.  Your \ndoctor may decide to lower the infusion rate or give you additional medicines to prevent such \nreactions from occurring. \n \nList of other side effects: \n   \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n\u2022 chest pain \u2022 sleepiness \u2022 fatigue \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing \u2022 increased heart beat \u2022 flushing \n\u2022 pallor \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 pain \n\u2022 itching \u2022 back pain \u2022 throat tightness \n\u2022 abnormal tear secretion \u2022 rash \u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 feeling weak \u2022 low heart rate \u2022 palpitations \n\u2022 tinnitus \u2022 lethargy \u2022 decreased sensitivity to pain \n\u2022 nasal congestion \u2022 syncope \u2022 burning sensation \n\u2022 diarrhoea \u2022 cough \u2022 wheezing \n\u2022 redness \u2022 abdominal discomfort \u2022 urticaria \n\u2022 muscle pain \u2022 swelling face \u2022 pain at the extremities \n\u2022 increased blood pressure \u2022 joint pain \u2022 nasopharyngitis \n\u2022 sudden swelling of the face \n\nor throat \n\u2022 decreased blood pressure \u2022 hot flush \n\n\u2022 oedema in extremities \u2022 chest discomfort \u2022 feeling hot  \n\u2022 vertigo \u2022 face oedema  \u2022 hyperthermia \n\u2022 stomach discomfort \u2022 exacerbated difficulty in \n\nbreathing \n\u2022 decreased mouth sensitivity \n\n\u2022 muscle spasms \u2022 muscle tightness \u2022 musculoskeletal stiffness \n   \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 tremor \u2022 itching eyes \u2022 low heart rate due to conduction \n\ndisturbances \n\u2022 red eyes \u2022 ear swelling \u2022 increased sensitivity to pain \n\u2022 ear pain \u2022 bronchospasm \u2022 upper respiratory tract congestion \n\u2022 throat pain \u2022 runny nose \u2022 red rash \n\u2022 fast breathing \u2022 heart burn \u2022 (mottled purplish) skin discoloration \n\u2022 itchy rash \u2022 skin discomfort \u2022 coldness of the extremities \n\u2022 feeling hot and cold \u2022 musculoskeletal pain \u2022 injection site blood clotting \n\u2022 difficulty swallowing \u2022 rhinitis \u2022 skin discoloration \n\u2022 infusion site pain \u2022 influenza-like illness \u2022 oedema \n\u2022 infusion site reaction \u2022 malaise  \n   \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\u2022 lower blood oxygen levels  \u2022 serious inflammation of the \n\nvessels \n \n\n \nIn some patients initially treated at the recommended dose, and whose dose was later reduced for an \nextended period, some symptoms of Fabry disease were reported more frequently. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

For doses lower than 35 mg use a minimum of \n50 ml, for doses 35 to 70 mg use a minimum of 100 ml, for doses 70 to 100 mg use a minimum \nof 250 ml and for doses greater than 100 mg use only 500 ml. Gently invert or lightly massage \nthe infusion bag to mix the diluted solution. Do not shake or excessively agitate the infusion \nbag. \n\n \nAdministration \n \n10. It is recommended to administer the diluted solution through an in-line low protein-binding \n\n0.2 \u00b5m filter to remove any protein particles which will not lead to any loss of agalsidase beta \nactivity. The initial infusion rate should be no more than 0.25 mg/min (15 mg/hour) to \nminimise the potential occurrence of infusion-associated reactions. After patient tolerance is \nestablished, the infusion rate may be increased gradually with subsequent infusions. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
