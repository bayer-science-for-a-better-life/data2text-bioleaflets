NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO 38.5 micrograms powder for concentrate and solution for solution for infusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne vial of powder contains 38.5 micrograms blinatumomab.  \n\n \n\nReconstitution with water for injections results in a final blinatumomab concentration of \n\n12.5 micrograms/mL.  \n\n \n\nBlinatumomab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \nPowder for concentrate and solution for solution for infusion. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO powder (powder for concentrate): White to off-white powder. \n\n \n\nSolution (stabiliser): Colourless-to-slightly yellow, clear solution with a pH of 7.0. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome \n\nnegative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome \n\nnegative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal \n\nresidual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older \n\nwith Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in \n\nrelapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic \n\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by physicians experienced in the \n\ntreatment of haematological malignancies.  \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL, \n\nhospitalisation is recommended for initiation at a minimum for the first 9 days of the first cycle and \n\nthe first 2 days of the second cycle. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nFor the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome negative MRD positive B-precursor ALL, \n\nhospitalisation is recommended at a minimum for the first 3 days of the first cycle and the first \n\n2 days of subsequent cycles. \n\n \n\nIn patients with a history or presence of clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology \n\n(see section 4.4), hospitalisation is recommended at a minimum for the first 14 days of the first \n\ncycle. In the second cycle, hospitalisation is recommended at a minimum for 2 days, and clinical \n\njudgment should be based on tolerance to BLINCYTO in the first cycle. Caution should be exercised \n\nas cases of late occurrence of first neurological events have been observed.  \n\n \n\nFor all subsequent cycle starts and reinitiation (e.g. if treatment is interrupted for 4 or more hours), \n\nsupervision by a healthcare professional or hospitalisation is recommended. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO infusion bags should be prepared to infuse over 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, or \n\n96 hours. See method of administration. \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nPhiladelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL \n\n \n\nPatients may receive 2 cycles of treatment. A single cycle of treatment is 28 days (4 weeks) of \n\ncontinuous infusion. Each cycle of treatment is separated by a 14 day (2 week) treatment-free \n\ninterval.  \n\n \n\nPatients who have achieved complete remission (CR/CRh*) after 2 treatment cycles may receive up \n\nto 3 additional cycles of BLINCYTO consolidation treatment, based on an individual benefits-risks \n\nassessment.  \n\n \n\nRecommended daily dose is by patient weight. Patients greater than or equal to 45 kg receive a \n\nfixed-dose and for patients less than 45 kg, the dose is calculated using the patient’s body surface \n\narea (BSA). \n\n \n\nPatient \n\nweight \n\nCycle 1 Subsequent cycles \n\nDays 1-7 Days 8-28 Days 29-42 Days 1-28 Days 29-42 \n\nGreater than \n\nor equal to \n\n45 kg  \n\n(fixed-dose) \n\n9 mcg/day \n\nvia \n\ncontinuous \n\ninfusion \n\n28 mcg/day \n\nvia continuous \n\ninfusion \n\n14 day \n\ntreatment free \n\ninterval \n\n28 mcg/day \n\nvia continuous \n\ninfusion \n\n14 day \n\ntreatment free \n\ninterval \n\nLess than \n\n45 kg  \n\n(BSA-based \n\ndose) \n\n5 mcg/m2/day \n\nvia \n\ncontinuous \n\ninfusion  \n\n(not to exceed \n\n9 mcg/day) \n\n \n\n15 mcg/m2/day \n\nvia continuous \n\ninfusion  \n\n(not to exceed \n\n28 mcg/day) \n\n \n\n15 mcg/m2/day \n\nvia continuous \n\ninfusion  \n\n(not to exceed \n\n28 mcg/day) \n\n \n\n \n\nPremedication and additional medication recommendations \n\n \n\nIn adult patients, dexamethasone 20 mg intravenous should be administered 1 hour prior to initiation \n\nof each cycle of BLINCYTO therapy.  \n\n \n\nIn paediatric patients, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 (not to exceed 20 mg) should be administered orally \n\nor intravenously 6 to 12 hours prior to the start of BLINCYTO (cycle 1, day 1). This should be \n\nfollowed by dexamethasone 5 mg/m2 orally or intravenously within 30 minutes prior to the start of \n\nBLINCYTO (cycle 1, day 1). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAnti-pyretic use (e.g. paracetamol) is recommended to reduce pyrexia during the first 48 hours of \n\neach treatment cycle. \n\n \n\nIntrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis is recommended before and during BLINCYTO therapy to \n\nprevent central nervous system ALL relapse. \n\n \n\nPre-phase treatment for patients with high tumour burden \n\n \n\nFor patients with ≥ 50% leukaemic blasts in bone marrow or > 15,000/microlitre peripheral blood \n\nleukaemic blast counts treat with dexamethasone (not to exceed 24 mg/day).  \n\n \n\nMRD positive B-precursor ALL \n\n \n\nWhen considering the use of BLINCYTO as a treatment for Philadelphia chromosome negative \n\nMRD positive B-precursor ALL, quantifiable MRD should be confirmed in a validated assay with \n\nminimum sensitivity of 10-4 (see section 5.1). Clinical testing of MRD, regardless of the choice of \n\ntechnique, should be performed by a qualified laboratory familiar with the technique, following well \n\nestablished technical guidelines. \n\n \n\nPatients may receive 1 cycle of induction treatment followed by up to 3 additional cycles of \n\nBLINCYTO consolidation treatment. A single cycle of treatment of BLINCYTO induction or \n\nconsolidation is 28 days (4 weeks) of continuous intravenous infusion followed by a 14 day (2 week) \n\ntreatment-free interval (total 42 days). The majority of patients who respond to blinatumomab \n\nachieve a response after 1 cycle (see section 5.1). Therefore, the potential benefit and risks \n\nassociated with continued therapy in patients who do not show haematological and/or clinical \n\nimprovement after 1 treatment cycle should be assessed by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nRecommended dose (for patients at least 45 kg in weight): \n\n \n\nTreatment cycle(s) \n\nInduction Cycle 1 \n\nDays 1-28 Days 29-42 \n\n28 mcg/day 14-day treatment-free interval \n\nConsolidation Cycles 2-4 \n\nDays 1-28 Days 29-42 \n\n28 mcg/day 14-day treatment-free interval \n\n \n\nPremedication and additional medication recommendations \n\n \n\nPrednisone 100 mg intravenously or equivalent (e.g. dexamethasone 16 mg) should be administered \n\n1 hour prior to initiation of each cycle of BLINCYTO therapy. \n\n \n\nAnti-pyretic use (e.g. paracetamol) is recommended to reduce pyrexia during the first 48 hours of \n\neach treatment cycle. \n\n \n\nIntrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis is recommended before and during BLINCYTO therapy to \n\nprevent central nervous system ALL relapse. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments \n\n \n\nFor patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL and \n\npatients with MRD positive B-precursor ALL receiving BLINCYTO, consideration to discontinue \n\nBLINCYTO temporarily or permanently as appropriate should be made in the case of the following \n\nsevere (grade 3) or life-threatening (grade 4) toxicities (see section 4.4): cytokine release syndrome, \n\n\n\n5 \n\ntumour lysis syndrome, neurological toxicity, elevated liver enzymes and any other clinically \n\nrelevant toxicities. \n\n \n\nIf the interruption of treatment after an adverse event is no longer than 7 days, continue the same \n\ncycle to a total of 28 days of infusion inclusive of days before and after the interruption in that cycle. \n\nIf an interruption due to an adverse event is longer than 7 days, start a new cycle. If the toxicity takes \n\nmore than 14 days to resolve, discontinue BLINCYTO permanently, except if described differently \n\nin the table below. \n\n \n\nToxicity Grade* Action for patients greater \n\nthan or equal to 45 kg \n\nAction for patients less than \n\n45 kg \n\nCytokine \n\nrelease \n\nsyndrome, \n\ntumour lysis \n\nsyndrome \n\nGrade 3  Interrupt BLINCYTO until \n\nresolved, then restart \n\nBLINCYTO at 9 mcg/day. \n\nEscalate to 28 mcg/day after \n\n7 days if the toxicity does not \n\nrecur. \n\n \n\nInterrupt BLINCYTO until \n\nresolved, then restart \n\nBLINCYTO at 5 mcg/m2/day. \n\nEscalate to 15 mcg/m2/day after \n\n7 days if the toxicity does not \n\nrecur. \n\n \n\nGrade 4 Discontinue BLINCYTO \n\npermanently. \n\n \n\nDiscontinue BLINCYTO \n\npermanently. \n\nNeurological \n\ntoxicity \n\nConvulsion  Discontinue BLINCYTO \n\npermanently if more than one \n\nconvulsion occurs. \n\n \n\nDiscontinue BLINCYTO \n\npermanently if more than one \n\nconvulsion occurs. \n\n \n\n Grade 3 Interrupt BLINCYTO until no \n\nmore than grade 1 (mild) and \n\nfor at least 3 days, then restart \n\nBLINCYTO at 9 mcg/day. \n\nEscalate to 28 mcg/day after \n\n7 days if the toxicity does not \n\nrecur.

There is \n\nlimited experience with BLINCYTO in patients ≥ 75 years of age. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic analyses, dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate renal dysfunction (see section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of BLINCYTO have not been \n\nstudied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic analyses, no effect of baseline liver function on blinatumomab exposure \n\nis expected and adjustment of the initial dose is not necessary (see section 5.2). The safety and \n\nefficacy of BLINCYTO have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of BLINCYTO in children < 1 year of age have not yet been established. \n\nThere are no data for children < 7 months of age. Currently available data in children are described \n\nin section 4.8 and 5.1. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nImportant note: Do not flush the BLINCYTO infusion line or intravenous catheter, especially \n\nwhen changing infusion bags. Flushing when changing bags or at completion of infusion can \n\nresult in excess dosage and complications thereof. When administering via a multi-lumen \n\nvenous catheter, BLINCYTO should be infused through a dedicated lumen.  \n\n \n\nFor instructions on the handling and preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO solution for infusion is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion delivered at a \n\nconstant flow rate using an infusion pump over a period of up to 96 hours.  \n\n \n\nThe BLINCYTO solution for infusion must be administered using intravenous tubing that contains a \n\nsterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding 0.2 micrometre in-line filter. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe starting volume (270 mL) is more than the volume administered to the patient (240 mL) to \n\naccount for the priming of the intravenous tubing and to ensure that the patient will receive the full \n\ndose of BLINCYTO. \n\n \n\nInfuse BLINCYTO solution according to the instructions on the pharmacy label on the prepared bag \n\nat one of the following constant infusion rates: \n\n \n\n• Infusion rate of 10 mL/h for a duration of 24 hours \n\n• Infusion rate of 5 mL/h for a duration of 48 hours \n\n• Infusion rate of 3.3 mL/h for a duration of 72 hours \n\n• Infusion rate of 2.5 mL/h for a duration of 96 hours \n \n\nThe choice of the infusion duration should be made by the treating physician considering the \n\nfrequency of the infusion bag changes. The target therapeutic dose of BLINCYTO delivered does not \n\nchange. \n\n \n\nChange of infusion bag \n\n \n\nThe infusion bag must be changed at least every 96 hours by a healthcare professional for sterility \n\nreasons. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nNeurologic events \n\n \n\nNeurologic events including events with a fatal outcome have been observed. Grade 3 (CTCAE \n\nversion 4.0) or higher (severe or life-threatening) neurologic events following initiation of \n\nblinatumomab administration included encephalopathy, seizures, speech disorders, disturbances in \n\nconsciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Among patients \n\nthat experienced a neurologic event, the median time to the first event was within the first two weeks \n\nof treatment and the majority of events resolved after treatment interruption and infrequently led to \n\nBLINCYTO treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nElderly patients may be more susceptible to serious neurologic events such as cognitive disorder, \n\nencephalopathy, and confusion.  \n\n \n\nPatients with a medical history of neurologic signs and symptoms (such as dizziness, hypoaesthesia, \n\nhyporeflexia, tremor, dysaesthesia, paraesthesia, memory impairment) demonstrated a higher rate of \n\nneurologic events (such as tremor, dizziness, confusional state, encephalopathy and ataxia). Among \n\nthese patients, the median time to the first neurologic event was within the first cycle of treatment. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience in patients with a history or presence of clinically relevant central \n\nnervous system (CNS) pathology (e.g. epilepsy, seizure, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain \n\ninjuries, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, psychosis) as \n\nthey were excluded from clinical trials. There is a possibility of a higher risk of neurologic events in \n\nthis population. The potential benefits of treatment should be carefully weighed against the risk of \n\nneurologic events and heightened caution should be exercised when administering BLINCYTO to \n\nthese patients. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with blinatumomab in patients with documented active ALL in the CNS \n\nor cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However patients have been treated with blinatumomab in clinical \n\n\n\n8 \n\nstudies after clearance of CSF blasts with CNS directed therapy (such as intrathecal chemotherapy). \n\nTherefore once the CSF is cleared, treatment with BLINCYTO may be initiated.  \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that a neurological examination be performed in patients prior to starting \n\nBLINCYTO therapy and that patients be clinically monitored for signs and symptoms of neurologic \n\nevents (e.g. writing test). Management of these signs and symptoms to resolution may require either \n\ntemporary interruption or permanent discontinuation of BLINCYTO (see section 4.2). In the event of \n\na seizure, secondary prophylaxis with appropriate anticonvulsant medicinal products (e.g. \n\nlevetiracetam) is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving blinatumomab, serious infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, bacteraemia, \n\nopportunistic infections and catheter site infections have been observed, some of which were life-\n\nthreatening or fatal. Adult patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance \n\nstatus at baseline of 2 experienced a higher incidence of serious infections compared to patients with \n\nECOG performance status of < 2. There is limited experience with BLINCYTO in patients with an \n\nactive uncontrolled infection.  \n\n \n\nPatients receiving BLINCYTO should be clinically monitored for signs and symptoms of infection \n\nand treated appropriately. Management of infections may require either temporary interruption or \n\ndiscontinuation of BLINCYTO (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nCytokine release syndrome and infusion reactions \n\n \n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS) which may be life-threatening or fatal (grade ≥ 4) has been \n\nreported in patients receiving BLINCYTO (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nSerious adverse events that may be signs and symptoms of CRS included pyrexia, asthenia, \n\nheadache, hypotension, total bilirubin increased, and nausea; uncommonly, these events led to \n\nBLINCYTO discontinuation. The median time to onset of a CRS event was 2 days. Patients should \n\nbe closely monitored for signs or symptoms of these events.  \n\n \n\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and capillary leak syndrome (CLS, e.g. hypotension, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration) have been commonly associated with CRS \n\n(see section 4.8). Patients experiencing capillary leak syndrome should be managed promptly. \n\n \n\nHaemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) has been uncommonly \n\nreported in the setting of CRS.  \n\n \n\nInfusion reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS (see section 4.8). \n\nThe infusion reactions were generally rapid, occurring within 48 hours after initiating infusion. \n\nHowever some patients reported delayed onset of infusion reactions or in later cycles. Patients \n\nshould be observed closely for infusion reactions, especially during the initiation of the first and \n\nsecond treatment cycles and treated appropriately. Anti-pyretic use (e.g. paracetamol) is \n\nrecommended to help reduce pyrexia during the first 48 hours of each cycle. To mitigate the risk of \n\nCRS, it is important to initiate BLINCYTO (cycle 1, days 1-7) at the recommended starting dose in \n\nsection 4.2.  \n\n \n\nManagement of these events may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of \n\nBLINCYTO (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal (grade ≥ 4) has been observed \n\nin patients receiving BLINCYTO.  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAppropriate prophylactic measures including aggressive hydration and anti-hyperuricaemic therapy \n\n(such as allopurinol or rasburicase) should be used for the prevention and treatment of TLS during \n\nBLINCYTO treatment, especially in patients with higher leukocytosis or a high tumour burden. \n\nPatients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, including renal function and \n\nfluid balance in the first 48 hours after the first infusion. In clinical studies, patients with moderate \n\nrenal impairment showed an increased incidence of TLS compared with patients with mild renal \n\nimpairment or normal renal function. Management of these events may require either temporary \n\ninterruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and febrile neutropenia \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and febrile neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed in patients \n\nreceiving BLINCYTO. Laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to white blood cell count \n\nand absolute neutrophil count) should be monitored routinely during BLINCYTO infusion, \n\nespecially during the first 9 days of the first cycle, and treated appropriately. \n\n \n\nElevated liver enzymes \n \n\nTreatment with BLINCYTO was associated with transient elevations in liver enzymes. The majority \n\nof the events were observed within the first week of treatment initiation and did not require \n\ninterruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl \n\ntransferase (GGT), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO treatment \n\nespecially during the first 48 hours of the first 2 cycles should be performed. Management of these \n\nevents may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\n \n\nPancreatitis, life-threatening or fatal, has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO in clinical \n\ntrials and the post-marketing setting. High-dose steroid therapy may have contributed, in some cases, \n\nto the pancreatitis. \n\n \n\nPatients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Patient evaluation may \n\ninclude physical examination, laboratory evaluation for serum amylase and serum lipase, and \n\nabdominal imaging, such as ultrasound and other appropriate diagnostic measures. Management of \n\npancreatitis may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nLeukoencephalopathy including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  \n\n \n\nCranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been \n\nobserved in patients receiving BLINCYTO, especially in patients with prior treatment with cranial \n\nirradiation and anti-leukaemic chemotherapy (including systemic high dose methotrexate or \n\nintrathecal cytarabine). The clinical significance of these imaging changes is unknown. \n\n \n\nDue to the potential for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), patients should be \n\nmonitored for signs and symptoms. In case of suspicious events consider consultation with a \n\nneurologist, brain MRI and examination of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), see section 4.8. \n\n \n\nImmunisations \n\n \n\nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following BLINCYTO therapy has not \n\nbeen studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to \n\nthe start of BLINCYTO treatment, during treatment, and until recovery of B-lymphocytes to normal \n\nranges following last treatment cycle. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDue to the potential depletion of B-cells in newborns following exposure to blinatumomab during \n\npregnancy, newborns should be monitored for B-cell depletion and vaccinations with live virus \n\nvaccines should be postponed until the infant’s B-cell count has recovered (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nContraception \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 48 hours, \n\nafter treatment with BLINCYTO (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nMedication errors \n\n \nMedication errors have been observed with BLINCYTO treatment. It is very important that the \n\ninstructions for preparation (including reconstitution and dilution) and administration are strictly \n\nfollowed to minimise medication errors (including underdose and overdose) (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product provides less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium over a 24 hour infusion i.e. \n\n“essentially sodium-free”. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Results from an in vitro test in human \n\nhepatocytes suggest that blinatumomab did not affect CYP450 enzyme activities.  \n\n \n\nInitiation of BLINCYTO treatment causes transient release of cytokines during the first days of \n\ntreatment that may suppress CYP450 enzymes. Patients who are receiving medicinal products that \n\nare CYP450 and transporter substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored for \n\nadverse effects (e.g. warfarin) or drug concentrations (e.g. cyclosporine) during this time. The dose \n\nof the concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with blinatumomab. In an embryo-foetal \n\ndevelopmental toxicity study conducted in mice, the murine surrogate molecule crossed the placenta \n\nand did not induce embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). The expected depletions of B \n\nand T-cells were observed in the pregnant mice but haematological effects were not assessed in \n\nfoetuses. \n\n \n\nThere are no data from the use of blinatumomab in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nBlinatumomab should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the \n\npotential risk to the foetus.  \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 48 hours \n\nafter treatment with blinatumomab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, depletion of B-cells may be expected in newborns due to the \n\npharmacological properties of the product. Consequently, newborns should be monitored for B-cell \n\ndepletion and vaccinations with live virus vaccines should be postponed until the infant’s B-cell \n\ncount has recovered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether blinatumomab or metabolites are excreted in human milk. Based on its \n\npharmacological properties, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Consequently, as a \n\nprecautionary measure, breast-feeding is contraindicated during and for at least 48 hours after \n\ntreatment with blinatumomab. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of blinatumomab on fertility. No adverse \n\neffects on male or female mouse reproductive organs in 13 week toxicity studies with the murine \n\nsurrogate molecule (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nBlinatumomab has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Confusion and \n\ndisorientation, coordination and balance disorders, risk of seizures and disturbances in consciousness \n\ncan occur (see section 4.4). Due to the potential for neurologic events, patients receiving \n\nblinatumomab should refrain from driving, engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as \n\ndriving or operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while blinatumomab is being \n\nadministered. Patients must be advised that they may experience neurologic events.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions described in this section were identified in clinical studies of patients with \n\nB-precursor ALL (N = 843). \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during blinatumomab treatment include: \n\ninfections (24.8%), neurologic events (13.8%), neutropenia/febrile neutropenia (10.1%), cytokine \n\nrelease syndrome (3.3%), and tumour lysis syndrome (0.7%). \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions were: pyrexia (69.2%), infusion-related reactions (43.4%), \n\ninfections – pathogen unspecified (42.1%), headache (32.9%), anaemia (22.8%), thrombocytopenia \n\n(20.9%), febrile neutropenia (20.2%), oedema (20.0%), neutropenia (19.7%), rash (16.7%), \n\nincreased liver hepatic enzymes (16.1%), bacterial infectious disorders (15.4%), tremor (15.2%), \n\ncough (15.1%), leukopenia (13.4%), back pain (13.3%), chills (13.0%), hypotension (12.8%), viral \n\ninfectious disorders (12.7%), decreased immunoglobulins (12.5%), cytokine release syndrome \n\n(11.6%), tachycardia (11.3%), insomnia (10.7%), fungal infectious disorders (10.6%) and pain in \n\nextremity (10.2%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and frequency category.

Serious \n\nand grade ≥ 3 neurologic adverse reactions were observed in 11.6% and 12.1% of patients \n\nrespectively, of which the most common serious adverse reactions were encephalopathy, tremor, \n\naphasia, and confusional state. The majority of neurologic events (80.5 %) were clinically reversible \n\nand resolved following interruption of BLINCYTO. The median time to the first event was within \n\nthe first two weeks of treatment. One case of fatal encephalopathy has been reported in an earlier \n\nphase II clinical single-arm study. \n\n \n\nNeurologic events were reported for 71.5% of adult patients with MRD positive B-precursor ALL \n\n(N = 137) of which 22.6% were considered serious. Grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 events, respectively, \n\nwere reported for 16.1% and 2.2% of adult patients with MRD positive B-precursor ALL. \n\n \n\nFor clinical management of neurologic events, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nLife-threatening or fatal (grade ≥ 4) viral, bacterial and fungal infections have been reported in \n\npatients treated with BLINCYTO. In addition, reactivations of virus infection (e.g. Polyoma (BK)) \n\nhave been observed in the phase II clinical study in adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative \n\nrelapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed or \n\nrefractory B-precursor ALL with ECOG performance status at baseline of 2 experienced a higher \n\nincidence of serious infections compared to patients with ECOG performance status of < 2. For \n\nclinical management of infections, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS) \n\n \n\nIn BLINCYTO-treated patients in the randomised phase III clinical study (N = 267) and the single \n\narm phase II clinical study (N = 189), serious CRS reactions were reported in 2.4% of patients with a \n\nmedian time to onset of 2 days.  \n\n \n\nCytokine release syndrome was reported in 2.9% of adult patients with MRD positive B-precursor \n\nALL (N = 137). Grade 3 and serious events were reported for 1.5% each of adult patients with MRD \n\npositive B-precursor ALL; no grade ≥ 4 events were reported. \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome was observed in 1 patient in the phase II clinical study in adult patients with \n\nrelapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL and in 1 patient in the phase 2 clinical study in adult patients \n\nwith MRD positive B-precursor ALL. \n\n \n\nFor clinical management of CRS, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nElevated liver enzymes \n\n \n\nIn BLINCYTO-treated patients in the randomised phase III clinical study (N = 267) and the single \n\narm phase II clinical study (N = 189), 22.4% of patients reported elevated liver enzymes and \n\nassociated signs/symptoms. Serious and grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions (such as ALT increased, AST \n\nincreased, and blood bilirubin increased) were observed in 1.5% and 13.6% of patients respectively. \n\nThe median time to onset to the first event was 4 days from the start of BLINCYTO treatment \n\ninitiation.  \n\n \n\nElevated liver enzyme events were reported for 12.4% of adult patients with MRD positive \n\nB-precursor ALL (N = 137). Grade ≥ 3 and grade ≥ 4 events, respectively, were reported for 8.0% \n\nand 4.4% of adult patients with MRD positive B-precursor ALL. \n\n \n\nThe duration of hepatic adverse reactions has generally been brief and with rapid resolution, often \n\nwhen continuing uninterrupted treatment with BLINCYTO.  \n\n \n\nFor clinical management of elevated liver enzymes, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\n \n\nPancreatitis, life-threatening or fatal, has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO in the \n\nclinical trials and the post-marketing settings. The median time to onset was 7.5 days. For clinical \n\nmanagement of pancreatitis, see section 4.4.  \n\n \n\nLeukoencephalopathy including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\n \n\nLeukoencephalopathy has been reported. Patients with brain MRI/CT findings consistent with \n\nleukoencephalopathy experienced concurrent serious adverse events including confusional state, \n\ntremor, cognitive disorder, encephalopathy, and convulsion. Although there is a potential for the \n\ndevelopment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), no confirmed case of PML has \n\nbeen reported in the clinical studies.  \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO has been evaluated in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL in \n\na phase I/II dose escalation/evaluation study, in which 70 paediatric patients, aged 7 months to \n\n17 years, were treated with the recommended dosage regimen. \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported serious adverse events were pyrexia (11.4%), febrile neutropenia \n\n(11.4%), cytokine release syndrome (5.7%), sepsis (4.3%), device-related infection (4.3%), overdose \n\n(4.3%), convulsion (2.9%), respiratory failure (2.9%), hypoxia (2.9%), pneumonia (2.9%), and \n\nmulti-organ failure (2.9%). \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions in BLINCYTO-treated paediatric patients were similar in type to those seen in \n\nadult patients. Adverse reactions that were observed more frequently (≥ 10% difference) in the \n\npaediatric population compared to the adult population were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, \n\nleukopenia, pyrexia, infusion-related reactions, weight increase, and hypertension. \n\n \n\nThe type and frequency of adverse events were similar across different paediatric sub-groups \n\n(gender, age, geographic region). \n\n \n\nAt a dose higher than the recommended dose, a case of fatal cardiac failure occurred in the setting of \n\nlife-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with BLINCYTO in patients ≥ 75 years of age. Generally, safety was \n\nsimilar between elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) and patients less than 65 years of age treated \n\nwith BLINCYTO. However, elderly patients may be more susceptible to serious neurologic events \n\nsuch as cognitive disorder, encephalopathy and confusion.  \n\n \n\nElderly patients with MRD-positive ALL treated with BLINCYTO may have an increased risk of \n\nhypogammaglobulinaemia compared to younger patients. It is recommended that immunoglobulin \n\nlevels are monitored in elderly patients during treatment with BLINCYTO. \n\n \n\nThe safety of BLINCYTO has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies of adult ALL patients treated with BLINCYTO, less than 3% tested positive for \n\nanti-blinatumomab antibodies. Six of those patients had anti-blinatumomab antibodies with in vitro \n\nneutralising activity. No anti-blinatumomab antibodies were detected in clinical studies of paediatric \n\npatients with relapsed or refractory ALL treated with blinatumomab. \n\n \n\nIf formation of anti-blinatumomab antibodies with a clinically significant effect is suspected, contact \n\nthe Marketing Authorisation Holder to discuss antibody testing. Contact details are provided in \n\nsection 6 of the package leaflet. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOverdoses have been observed including one patient who received 133-fold the recommended \n\ntherapeutic dose of BLINCYTO delivered over a short duration. Overdoses resulted in adverse \n\nreactions which were consistent with the reactions observed at the recommended therapeutic dose \n\nand included fever, tremors, and headache. In the event of overdose, the infusion should be \n\ntemporarily interrupted and patients should be monitored. Reinitiation of BLINCYTO at the correct \n\ntherapeutic dose should be considered when all toxicities have resolved and no earlier than 12 hours \n\nafter interruption of the infusion (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other Antineoplastic agents, ATC code: \n\nL01XC19. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nBlinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct that binds specifically to CD19 \n\nexpressed on the surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T-cells. It \n\nactivates endogenous T-cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 \n\non benign and malignant B-cells. The anti-tumour activity of blinatumomab immunotherapy is not \n\ndependent on T-cells bearing a specific TCR or on peptide antigens presented by cancer cells, but is \n\npolyclonal in nature and independent of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on target cells. \n\nBlinatumomab mediates the formation of a cytolytic synapse between the T-cell and the tumour cell, \n\nreleasing proteolytic enzymes to kill both proliferating and resting target cells. Blinatumomab is \n\nassociated with transient upregulation of cell adhesion molecules, production of cytolytic proteins, \n\nrelease of inflammatory cytokines, and proliferation of T-cells, and results in elimination of CD19+ \n\ncells.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nConsistent immune-pharmacodynamic responses were observed in patients studied. During the \n\ncontinuous intravenous infusion over 4 weeks, the pharmacodynamic response was characterised by \n\nT-cell activation and initial redistribution, rapid peripheral B-cell depletion, and transient cytokine \n\nelevation.  \n\n \n\nPeripheral T-cell redistribution (i.e. T-cell adhesion to blood vessel endothelium and/or \n\ntransmigration into tissue) occurred after start of blinatumomab infusion or dose escalation. T-cell \n\ncounts initially declined within 1 to 2 days and then returned to baseline levels within 7 to 14 days in \n\nthe majority of patients. Increase of T-cell counts above baseline (T-cell expansion) was observed in \n\nfew patients.  \n\n \n\nPeripheral B-cell counts decreased rapidly to an undetectable level during treatment at doses \n\n≥ 5 mcg/m2/day or ≥ 9 mcg/day in the majority of patients. No recovery of peripheral B-cell counts \n\nwas observed during the 2-week treatment-free period between treatment cycles. Incomplete \n\ndepletion of B-cells occurred at doses of 0.5 mcg/m2/day and 1.5 mcg/m2/day and in a few \n\nnon-responders at higher doses.  \n\n \n\nPeripheral lymphocytes were not measured in paediatric subjects. \n\n \n\nCytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ were measured and, IL-6, \n\nIL-10 and IFN-γ were most elevated. Transient elevation of cytokines was observed in the first two \n\ndays following start of blinatumomab infusion. The elevated cytokine levels returned to baseline \n\nwithin 24 to 48 hours during the infusion. In subsequent treatment cycles, cytokine elevation \n\n\n\n17 \n\noccurred in fewer patients with lesser intensity compared to the initial 48 hours of the first treatment \n\ncycle.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPhiladelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL \n\n \n\nA total of 456 patients aged ≥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL were \n\nexposed to BLINCYTO during the phase II and phase III clinical studies described below.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of BLINCYTO compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy were \n\nevaluated in a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase III study. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years \n\nof age and ECOG status ≤ 2 with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL (had > 5% blasts in the \n\nbone marrow and either relapse at any time after allogeneic HSCT, untreated first relapse with first \n\nremission duration < 12 months, or refractory to last therapy). \n\n \n\nPatients were randomised 2:1 to receive BLINCYTO or 1 of 4 prespecified, investigator-selected, \n\nSOC backbone chemotherapy regimens. Randomisation was stratified by age (< 35 years versus \n\n≥ 35 years of age), prior salvage therapy (yes versus no), and prior allogeneic HSCT (yes versus no) \n\nas assessed at the time of consent. The demographics and baseline characteristics were well-balanced \n\nbetween the two arms (see table 1). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The target dose of \n\n28 mcg/day was administered in cycle 2 and subsequent cycles starting on day 1 of each cycle. Dose \n\nadjustment was possible in case of adverse events. Of the 267 patients who received BLINCYTO, \n\nthe mean number of completed treatment cycles was 2.0; of the 109 patients who received SOC \n\nchemotherapy, the mean number of treatment cycles was 1.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nThe primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The median OS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 2.9, 5.3) \n\nin the SOC chemotherapy arm compared with 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the BLINCYTO arm. \n\nThe hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.71 (0.55, 0.93) between treatment arms favouring BLINCYTO, \n\nindicated a 29% reduction in hazard rate in the BLINCYTO arm (p-value = 0.012 (stratified log-rank \n\ntest)), see figure 1. Consistency in OS results was shown in subgroups by stratification factors. \n\n \n\nConsistent results were observed after censoring at the time of HSCT; median OS, censored at the \n\ntime of HSCT, was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.3, 8.8) in the BLINCYTO group and 3.9 months \n\n(95% CI: 2.8, 4.9) in the SOC group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.88; p value = 0.004). The mortality \n\nrate following alloHSCT among all responders who did not receive anti-leukemic therapy was \n\n10/38 (26.3%; 95% CI: 13.4, 43.1) in the BLINCYTO group and 3/12 (25%; 95% CI: 5.5, 57.2) in \n\nthe SOC group; such mortality rate at 100 days post alloHSCT was 4/38 (12.4%; 95% CI: 4.8%, \n\n29.9%) in the BLINCYTO group and 0/12 (0%; 95% CI: not estimable) in the SOC group.

CR was defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral \n\nblood counts (platelets > 100,000/microlitre and absolute neutrophil counts [ANC] > 1,000/microlitre). \nb. CRh* (complete remission with partial haematologic recovery) was defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone \n\nmarrow, no evidence of disease, and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets > 50,000/microlitre \n\nand ANC > 500/microlitre). \nc. CRi (complete remission with incomplete haematologic recovery) was defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone \n\nmarrow, no evidence of disease, and incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets \n\n> 100,000/microlitre or ANC > 1,000/microlitre). \nd. EFS time was calculated from the time of randomisation until the date of disease assessment indicating a \n\nrelapse after achieving a CR/CRh*/CRi or death, whichever is earlier. Subjects who fail to achieve a \n\nCR/CRh*/CRi within 12 weeks of treatment initiation are considered treatment failures and assigned an EFS \n\nduration of 1 day. \ne. MRD (minimum residual disease) response was defined as MRD by PCR or flow cytometry < 1 x 10-4.  \nf. Patients who achieved CR/CRh*/CRi and had an evaluable post baseline MRD assessment. \n \n\nHealth related quality of life \n\n \n\nIn this open-label study, Health related quality of life (HRQoL) reported by patients were measured \n\nusing the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life \n\nQuestionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). In a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, compared to SOC, \n\nBLINCYTO consistently delayed the time to clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL \n\n(≥ 10-point worsening from baseline) for global health status [median BLINCYTO versus SOC: \n\n8.1 months versus 1.0 month; HR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.42, 0.85)], functional scales, symptom scales \n\nand individual items. Because the health-related quality of life results are based on a post-hoc \n\nsensitivity analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution.  \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO was also evaluated in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II study of \n\n189 patients. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with Philadelphia chromosome negative \n\nrelapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL (relapsed with first remission duration of ≤ 12 months in first \n\nsalvage, or relapsed or refractory after first salvage therapy, or relapsed within 12 months of \n\nallogeneic HSCT, and had ≥ 10% blasts in bone marrow).  \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPremedication, BLINCYTO dose per treatment cycle and route of administration were identical to \n\nthose in the phase III study. Patients were premedicated with a mandatory cerebrospinal fluid \n\nprophylaxis consisting of an intrathecal regimen according to institutional or national guidelines \n\nwithin 1 week prior to start of BLINCYTO treatment. BLINCYTO was administered as a continuous \n\nintravenous infusion. In the first cycle, the initial dose was 9 mcg/day for week 1, then 28 mcg/day \n\nfor the remaining 3 weeks. The target dose of 28 mcg/day was administered in cycle 2 and \n\nsubsequent cycles starting on day 1 of each cycle. Dose adjustment was possible in the case of \n\nadverse events. The treated population included 189 patients who received at least 1 infusion of \n\nBLINCYTO; the mean number of cycles per patient was 1.6. Patients who responded to BLINCYTO \n\nbut later relapsed had the option to be retreated with BLINCYTO. Among treated patients, the \n\nmedian age was 39 years (range: 18 to 79 years, including 25 patients ≥ 65 years of age), 64 of \n\n189 (33.9%) had undergone HSCT prior to receiving BLINCYTO and 32 of 189 (16.9%) had \n\nreceived more than 2 prior salvage therapies.  \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was the complete remission/complete remission with partial haematological \n\nrecovery (CR/CRh*) rate within 2 cycles of treatment with BLINCYTO. Eighty-one of 189 (42.9%) \n\npatients achieved CR/CRh* within the first 2 treatment cycles with the majority of responses (64 of \n\n81) occurring within 1 cycle of treatment. In the elderly population (≥ 65 years of age) 11 of \n\n25 patients (44.0%) achieved CR/CRh* within the first 2 treatment cycles (see section 4.8 for safety \n\nin elderly). Four patients achieved CR during consolidation cycles, resulting in a cumulative CR rate \n\nof 35.4% (67/189; 95% CI: 28.6% - 42.7%). Thirty-two of 189 (17%) patients underwent allogeneic \n\nHSCT in CR/CRh* induced with BLINCYTO (see table 3).  \n\n \n\nTable 3.

CR was defined as ≤ 5% of blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral \n\nblood counts (platelets > 100,000/microlitre and absolute neutrophil counts [ANC] > 1,000/microlitre). \n2. CRh* was defined as ≤ 5% of blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and partial recovery of \n\nperipheral blood counts (platelets > 50,000/microlitre and ANC > 500/microlitre). \n3. Blast free hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow was defined as bone marrow blasts ≤ 5%, no evidence of \n\ndisease, insufficient recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets ≤ 50,000/microlitre and/or ANC \n\n≤ 500/microlitre. \n4. Partial remission was defined as bone marrow blasts 6% to 25% with at least a 50% reduction from baseline. \n5. Relapse was defined as haematological relapse (blasts in bone marrow greater than 5% following CR) or an \n\nextramedullary relapse. \n \n\nIn a prespecified exploratory analysis, 60 of 73 MRD evaluable patients with CR/CRh* (82.2%) also \n\nhad a MRD response (defined as MRD by PCR < 1 x 10-4).  \n\n \n\nPatients with prior allogeneic HSCT had similar response rates to those without prior HSCT, older \n\npatients had similar response rates to younger patients, and no substantial difference was observed in \n\nremission rates based on the number of lines of prior salvage treatment.  \n\n \n\nIn patients with non-CNS/non-testes extramedullary disease (defined as at least 1 lesion ≥ 1.5 cm) at \n\nscreening (N = 8/189) clinical response rates (25% [95% CI: 3.2-65.1] were lower compared with \n\npatients with no evidence of extramedullary disease (N = 181, 43.6% [95% CI: 36.3 - 51.2]) (see \n\nfigure 2). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nPatients with the highest tumour burden as measured by the percentage of bone marrow blast cells at \n\nbaseline (≥ 90%) still had a clinically meaningful response with a CR/CRh* rate of 21.6% (CI \n\n12.9 - 32.7) (see figure 2). Patients with low tumour burden (< 50%) responded best to BLINCYTO \n\ntreatment with CR/CRh* rate of 72.9% (CI 59.7 - 83.6). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

This was a two-part study, a dose-finding part to determine \n\nthe appropriate dosing regimen, followed by a single-arm efficacy part using this regimen. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. In the dose-finding part of the \n\nstudy, doses of up to 30 mcg/m2/day were evaluated. The recommended dose for the PK expansion \n\nand efficacy parts of the study was determined to be 5 mcg/m2/day on days 1-7 and 15 mcg/m2/day \n\non days 8-28 for cycle 1, and 15 mcg/m2/day on days 1-28 for subsequent cycles. Dose adjustment \n\nwas possible in case of adverse events. Patients who responded to BLINCYTO but later relapsed had \n\nthe option to be retreated with BLINCYTO.  \n\n \n\nThe treated population (in the dose-finding, PK expansion, and efficacy parts) included 70 patients \n\nwho received at least 1 infusion of BLINCYTO at the recommended dose; the mean number of \n\ntreatment cycles was 1.5. Among treated patients, the median age was 8 years (range: 7 months to \n\n17 years), 40 out of 70 (57.1%) had undergone allogeneic HSCT prior to receiving BLINCYTO, and \n\n39 out of 70 (55.7%) had refractory disease. Most patients had a high tumour burden (≥ 50% \n\nleukaemic blasts in bone marrow) at baseline with a median of 75.5% bone marrow blasts. \n\n \n\nTwenty out of 70 (28.6%) patients achieved CR/CRh* within the first 2 treatment cycles with 17 out \n\nof 20 (85%) occurring within cycle 1 of treatment. Four patients achieved M1 bone marrow but did \n\nnot meet the peripheral blood count recovery criteria for CR or CRh*. Eleven of the 20 patients \n\n(55%) who achieved CR/CRh* received an allogeneic HSCT. The CR/CRh* for patients less than \n\n2 years of age was 40% (4/10), for patients 2 to 6 years was 30.0% (6/20); and for patients aged 7 to \n\n17 years was 25% (10/40). 3 patients < 1 year of age refractory to prior treatment and without prior \n\nalloHSCT received one cycle of Blincyto at a dose of 5-15 µg/m2/day. None of the 3 subjects \n\n< 1 year old achieved a CR/CRh*, 1 patient had progressive disease (OS 2.3 months) and 2 were \n\nnon-responders (OS 1.1 months and 8.7 months, respectively).

Following continuous intravenous \n\ninfusion, the steady state serum concentration (Css) was achieved within a day and remained stable \n\nover time. The increase in mean Css values was approximately proportional to the dose in the range \n\ntested. At the clinical doses of 9 mcg/day and 28 mcg/day for the treatment of relapsed/refractory \n\nALL, the mean (SD) Css was 230 (359) pg/mL and 612 (532) pg/mL, respectively. The \n\npharmacokinetics of blinatumomab in patients with MRD positive B-precursor ALL was similar to \n\npatients with relapsed or refractory ALL. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe estimated mean (SD) volume of distribution based on terminal phase (Vz) was 4.52 (2.89) L \n\nwith the continuous intravenous infusion of blinatumomab.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe metabolic pathway of blinatumomab has not been characterised. Like other protein therapeutics, \n\nblinatumomab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic \n\npathways.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe estimated mean (SD) systemic clearance with continuous intravenous infusion in patients \n\nreceiving blinatumomab in clinical studies was 2.92 (2.83) L/hour. The mean (SD) half-life was \n\n2.11 (1.42) hours. Negligible amounts of blinatumomab were excreted in the urine at the tested \n\nclinical doses.  \n\n \n\nBody surface area, gender and age \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic \n\ncharacteristics on blinatumomab pharmacokinetics. Results suggest that age (7 months to 80 years) \n\nand gender do not influence the pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab. Body surface area (0.37 to \n\n2.70 m2) influences the pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab. However the influence is negligible in \n\nadults and body surface area based dosing is recommended in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nNo formal pharmacokinetic studies of blinatumomab have been conducted in patients with renal \n\nimpairment.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic analyses showed an approximately 2-fold difference in mean blinatumomab \n\nclearance values between patients with moderate renal dysfunction and normal renal function. \n\nHowever high inter-patient variability was discerned (CV% up to 95.6%), and clearance values in \n\nrenal impaired patients were essentially within the range observed in patients with normal renal \n\nfunction, no clinically meaningful impact of renal function on clinical outcomes is expected. \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nNo formal pharmacokinetic studies of blinatumomab have been conducted in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Baseline ALT and AST levels were used to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on \n\nthe clearance of blinatumomab. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that there was no \n\nassociation between ALT or AST levels and the clearance of blinatumomab.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab appear linear over a dose range from 5 to 30 mcg/m2/day in \n\npaediatric patients. At the recommended doses, the mean (SD) steady state concentration (Css) \n\nvalues were 162 (179) and 533 (392) pg/mL at 5 and 15 mcg/m2/day doses, respectively. The \n\nestimated mean (SD) volume of distribution (Vz), clearance (CL) and terminal half-life (t1/2,z) were \n\n3.91 (3.36) L/m2, 1.88 (1.90) L/hr/m2 and 2.19 (1.53) hours, respectively. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with blinatumomab and the murine surrogate revealed the \n\nexpected pharmacologic effects (including release of cytokines, decreases in leukocyte counts, \n\ndepletion of B-cells, decreases in T-cells, decreased cellularity in lymphoid tissues). These changes \n\nreversed after cessation of treatment.  \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with blinatumomab. In an embryo-foetal \n\ndevelopmental toxicity study performed in mice, the murine surrogate crossed the placenta to a limited \n\nextent (foetal-to-maternal serum concentration ratio < 1%) and did not induce embryo-foetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity. The expected depletions of B- and T-cells were observed in the pregnant mice but \n\nhaematological effects were not assessed in foetuses. No studies have been conducted to evaluate \n\ntreatment-related effects on fertility. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organs in \n\ntoxicity studies with the murine surrogate. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Preparation of BLINCYTO should \n\nbe:  \n- performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice \n\nrules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products. \n- prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\n \n\nIt is very important that the instructions for preparation and administration provided in this section \n\nare strictly followed to minimise medication errors (including underdose and overdose).  \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nSpecial instructions to support accurate preparation \n\n \n\n• A solution (stabiliser) is provided inside the BLINCYTO package and is used to coat the pre-\nfilled infusion bag prior to addition of reconstituted BLINCYTO. Do not use this solution \n\n(stabiliser) for reconstitution of BLINCYTO powder for concentrate. \n\n• The entire volume of the reconstituted and diluted BLINCYTO will be more than the volume \nto be administered to the patient (240 mL). This is to account for intravenous infusion line loss \n\nand to assure that the patient will receive the full dose of BLINCYTO.  \n\n• When preparing an infusion bag, remove all air from infusion bag. This is particularly \nimportant when using an ambulatory infusion pump.  \n\n• Use the specific volumes described in the reconstitution and dilution instructions below to \nminimise errors in calculation.  \n\n \n\nOther instructions \n\n \n\n• BLINCYTO is compatible with polyolefin, PVC non-di-ethylhexylphthalate (non-DEHP), or \nethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) infusion bags/pump cassettes.  \n\n• Pump specifications: The infusion pump to administer BLINCYTO solution for infusion \nshould be programmable, lockable and have an alarm. Elastomeric pumps should not be used. \n\n• Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with \nlocal requirements.  \n\n \n\nPreparation of the solution for infusion  \n\n \n\nSpecific reconstitution and dilution instructions are provided for each dose and infusion time.

Use an infusion bag pre-filled with 250 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection that usually contains a total volume of 265 to 275 mL.  \n\n2. To coat the infusion bag, using a syringe, aseptically transfer 5.5 mL of the solution \n(stabiliser) to the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to avoid foaming. Discard \n\nthe remaining solution (stabiliser) vial.  \n\n3. Using a syringe, reconstitute each vial of BLINCYTO powder for concentrate using 3 mL of \nwater for injections. Direct the water for injections toward the side of the vial during \n\nreconstitution. Gently swirl contents to avoid excess foaming. Do not shake. \n\n• Do not reconstitute BLINCYTO powder for concentrate with the solution \n(stabiliser).  \n\n• The addition of water for injections to the powder for concentrate results in a total \nvolume of 3.08 mL for a final BLINCYTO concentration of 12.5 mcg/mL.  \n\n4. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discolouration during \nreconstitution and prior to infusion. The resulting solution should be clear to slightly \n\nopalescent, colourless-to-slightly yellow. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has \n\nprecipitated.  \n\n5. Using a syringe, aseptically transfer reconstituted BLINCYTO into the infusion bag (refer to \ntable 7 to table 9 for the specific volume of reconstituted BLINCYTO). Gently mix the \n\ncontents of the bag to avoid foaming. Discard any remaining BLINCYTO reconstituted \n\nsolution. \n\n6. Under aseptic conditions, attach the intravenous tubing to the infusion bag with the sterile \n0.2 micron in-line filter.  \n\n7. Remove air from the infusion bag and prime the intravenous infusion line only with the \nprepared solution for infusion. Do not prime with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection.  \n\n8. Store at 2°C - 8°C if not used immediately. \n \n\n \n\n7.

What BLINCYTO is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThe active ingredient in BLINCYTO is blinatumomab. This belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantineoplastic agents which target cancer cells.  \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO is used to treat adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Acute lymphoblastic \n\nleukaemia is a cancer of the blood in which a particular kind of white blood cell called \n\n“B-lymphocyte” is growing out of control. This medicine works by enabling your immune system to \n\nattack and destroy these abnormal white blood cancer cells. BLINCYTO is used when acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia has come back or has not responded to previous treatment (referred to as \n\nrelapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia).  \n\n \n\nIt is also used in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who still have a small number of \n\ncancer cells remaining after previous treatment (referred to as minimal residual disease). \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO is used to treat children (≥ 1 year old), teenagers and young adults with acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when previous treatments have not worked or have stopped \n\nworking. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use BLINCYTO  \n\n \n\nDo not use BLINCYTO: \n\n- if you are allergic to blinatumomab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using BLINCYTO if any of these apply to you. \n\nBLINCYTO may not be suitable for you:  \n\n• if you have ever had neurological problems, for example, shaking (or tremor), abnormal \nsensations, seizures, memory loss, confusion, disorientation, loss of balance, or difficulty in \n\nspeaking. If you are still suffering from active neurological problems or conditions, tell your \n\ndoctor. If your leukaemia has spread to your brain and/or spinal cord, your doctor may have to \n\ntreat this first before you can start treatment with BLINCYTO. Your doctor will assess your \n\nnervous system and conduct tests before deciding if you should receive BLINCYTO. Your \n\ndoctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with BLINCYTO.  \n• if you have an active infection. \n\n• if you have ever had an infusion reaction after previously using BLINCYTO. Symptoms may \ninclude wheezing, flushing, face swelling, difficulty breathing, low or high blood pressure. \n\n• if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including those needed to travel \nto other countries. Some vaccines must not be given within two weeks before, at the same time \n\nas or in the months after you receive treatment with BLINCYTO. Your doctor will check if \n\nyou should have the vaccination. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following \n\nreactions whilst receiving BLINCYTO as these may need to be treated and your dose adjusted:  \n\n• if you experience seizures, difficulty in speaking or slurred speech, confusion and \ndisorientation, or loss of balance. \n\n• if you develop chills or shivering, or feel warm; you should take your temperature as you may \nhave a fever - these may be symptoms of an infection. \n\n• if you develop a reaction at any time during your infusion, which may include dizziness, \nfeeling faint, nauseated, face swelling, difficulty breathing, wheezing, or rash. \n\n• if you have severe and persistent stomach pain, with or without nausea and vomiting, as these \nmay be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal condition known as pancreatitis \n\n(inflammation of the pancreas). \n\n \n\nYour doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these reactions. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you became pregnant whilst receiving \n\nBLINCYTO. Your doctor will talk to you about precautions in using vaccinations for your baby. \n\n \n\nBefore each infusion cycle of BLINCYTO, you will be given medicines which help reduce a \n\npotentially life-threatening complication known as tumour lysis syndrome, which is caused by \n\nchemical disturbances in the blood due to the breakdown of dying cancer cells. You may also be \n\ngiven medicines to reduce fever. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment, especially in the first few days after treatment start, you may experience a severe \n\nlow white blood cell count (neutropenia), severe low white blood cell count with a fever (febrile \n\nneutropenia), elevated liver enzymes, or elevated uric acid. Your doctor will take regular blood tests \n\nto monitor your blood counts during treatment with BLINCYTO. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO should not be used in children below 1 year of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and BLINCYTO \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant, are breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nContraception \n\n \n\nWomen who are able to become pregnant have to use effective contraception during treatment and \n\nfor at least 48 hours after your last treatment. Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThe effects of BLINCYTO in pregnant women are not known but based on its mechanism of action, \n\nBLINCYTO may harm your unborn baby. You should not use BLINCYTO during pregnancy, unless \n\nyour doctor thinks that it is the best medicine for you. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant during BLINCYTO treatment, please inform your doctor or nurse. Your \n\ndoctor will talk to you about precautions in using vaccinations for your baby.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nYou must not breast-feed during and for at least 48 hours after your last treatment. It is not known \n\nwhether BLINCYTO is excreted in breast milk but a risk for suckling baby cannot be excluded.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nDo not drive, use heavy machines, or engage in hazardous activities while you are being given \n\nBLINCYTO. BLINCYTO can cause neurological problems such as dizziness, seizures, confusion, \n\ncoordination and balance disorders. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use BLINCYTO \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse have told you. Check with \n\nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow BLINCYTO is given \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO will be given to you through a vein (intravenous) continuously for 4 weeks using an \n\ninfusion pump (this is 1 treatment cycle). You will then have a 2-week break where you will not be \n\ngiven the infusion. Your infusion catheter will be attached to you at all times during each cycle of \n\nyour treatment. \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO is usually given for 2 treatment cycles if you have relapsed/refractory acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia, or for 1 treatment cycle if you have minimal residual disease acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia. If you respond to this treatment, your doctor may decide to give you up to \n\n3 additional cycles of treatment. The number of treatment cycles and the dose which you will be \n\ngiven will depend on how you tolerate and respond to BLINCYTO. Your doctor will discuss with \n\nyou how long your treatment will last. Your treatment may also be interrupted depending on how \n\nyou tolerate BLINCYTO.  \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nIf you have relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia it is recommended that the first 9 days \n\nof treatment and the first two days of the second cycle will be given to you in a hospital or clinic \n\nunder the supervision of a doctor or nurse experienced in the use of anti-cancer medicines.  \n\n \n\nIf you have minimal residual disease acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, it is recommended that the first \n\n3 days of treatment and the first 2 days of subsequent cycles will be given to you in a hospital or \n\nclinic under the supervision of a doctor or nurse experienced in the use of anti-cancer medicines. \n\n \n\nIf you have or had neurological problems, it is recommended that the first 14 days of treatment will \n\nbe given to you in a hospital or clinic. Your doctor will discuss with you if you can continue \n\ntreatment at home after your initial hospital stay. Treatment may include a bag change by a nurse.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will determine when your BLINCYTO infusion bag will be changed, which may range \n\nfrom every day to every 4 days. The infusion rate may be faster or slower depending on how often \n\nthe bag is changed. \n\n \n\nYour first cycle \n\n \n\nIf you have relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and your body weight is greater than \n\nor equal to 45 kilograms the recommended initial dose in your first cycle is 9 micrograms per day for \n\n1 week. Your doctor may decide to then increase your dose to 28 micrograms per day for weeks 2, 3, \n\nand 4 of your treatment.  \n\n \n\nIf your body weight is less than 45 kilograms, the recommended initial dose in your first cycle will \n\nbe based on your weight and height. Your doctor may decide to then increase your dose for weeks 2, \n\n3, and 4 of your treatment.  \n\n \n\nIf you have minimal residual disease acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, your dose of BLINCYTO will \n\nbe 28 micrograms per day throughout the first cycle. \n\n \n\nYour next cycles \n\n \n\nIf your doctor determines that you should be given more cycles of BLINCYTO and if your body \n\nweight is greater than or equal to 45 kilograms, your pump will be set to infuse a dose of \n\n28 micrograms per day.  \n\n \n\nIf your doctor determines that you should be given more cycles of BLINCYTO and if your body \n\nweight is less than 45 kilograms, your pump will be set to infuse a dose based on your weight and \n\nheight. \n\n \n\nMedicines given before each cycle of BLINCYTO  \n\n \n\nBefore your treatment with BLINCYTO, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to help \n\nreduce infusion reactions and other possible side effects. These may include corticosteroids (e.g. \n\ndexamethasone). \n\n \n\nInfusion catheter \n\n \n\nIf you have a catheter for infusion, it is very important to keep the area around the catheter clean; \n\notherwise you could get an infection. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to care for your \n\ncatheter site. \n\n \n\nInfusion pump and intravenous tubing \n\n \n\nDo not adjust the settings on the pump, even if there is a problem or the pump alarm sounds. Any \n\nchanges to the pump settings may result in a dose that is too high or too low. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nContact your doctor or nurse immediately if: \n\n• there is a problem with the pump or the pump alarm sounds \n\n• the infusion bag empties before the scheduled bag change \n\n• if the infusion pump stops unexpectedly. Do not try to restart your pump. \n \n\nYour doctor or nurse will advise you on how to manage your daily activities around your infusion \n\npump. Contact your doctor or nurse if you have questions. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The target therapeutic dose of BLINCYTO delivered does not \n\nchange. \n\n \n\nAseptic preparation \n \n\nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation of BLINCYTO should \n\nbe:  \n- performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice \n\nrules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products. \n- prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\n \n\nIt is very important that the instructions for preparation and administration provided in this section \n\nare strictly followed to minimise medication errors (including underdose and overdose).  \n\n \n\nSpecial instructions to support accurate preparation \n\n \n\n• A solution (stabiliser) is provided inside the BLINCYTO package and is used to coat the \npre-filled infusion bag prior to addition of reconstituted BLINCYTO. Do not use this solution \n\n(stabiliser) for reconstitution of BLINCYTO powder for concentrate. \n\n• The entire volume of the reconstituted and diluted BLINCYTO will be more than the volume \nto be administered to the patient (240 mL). This is to account for intravenous infusion line loss \n\nand to assure that the patient will receive the full dose of BLINCYTO.  \n\n\n\n53 \n\n• When preparing an infusion bag, remove all air from infusion bag. This is particularly \nimportant when using an ambulatory infusion pump.  \n\n• Use the specific volumes described in the reconstitution and dilution instructions below to \nminimise errors in calculation.  \n\n \n\nOther instructions \n\n \n\n• BLINCYTO is compatible with polyolefin, PVC non-di-ethylhexylphthalate (non-DEHP), or \nethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) infusion bags/pump cassettes.  \n\n• Pump specifications: The infusion pump to administer BLINCYTO solution for infusion \nshould be programmable, lockable and have an alarm. Elastomeric pumps should not be used. \n\n• Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with \nlocal requirements.  \n\n \n\nPreparation of the solution for infusion  \n\n \n\nSpecific reconstitution and dilution instructions are provided for each dose and infusion time. Verify \n\nthe prescribed dose and infusion time of BLINCYTO and identify the appropriate dosing preparation \n\nin the relevant table below. Table 1 provides instructions for patients weighing greater than or equal \n\nto 45 kg whereas table 2 and table 3 provide instructions for patients weighing less than 45 kg. \n\nFollow the steps for reconstituting BLINCYTO and preparing the infusion bag detailed below \n\ntable 3. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Use an infusion bag pre-filled with 250 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection that usually contains a total volume of 265 to 275 mL.  \n\n2. To coat the infusion bag, using a syringe, aseptically transfer 5.5 mL of the solution \n(stabiliser) to the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to avoid foaming. Discard \n\nthe remaining solution (stabiliser) vial.  \n\n3. Using a syringe, reconstitute each vial of BLINCYTO powder for concentrate using 3 mL of \nwater for injections. Direct the water for injections toward the side of the vial during \n\nreconstitution. Gently swirl contents to avoid excess foaming. Do not shake. \n\n• Do not reconstitute BLINCYTO powder for concentrate with the solution \n(stabiliser).  \n\n• The addition of water for injections to the powder for concentrate results in a total \nvolume of 3.08 mL for a final BLINCYTO concentration of 12.5 mcg/mL.  \n\n4. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discolouration during \nreconstitution and prior to infusion. The resulting solution should be clear to slightly \n\nopalescent, colourless-to-slightly yellow. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has \n\nprecipitated.  \n\n5. Using a syringe, aseptically transfer reconstituted BLINCYTO into the infusion bag (refer to \ntable 1 to table 3 for the specific volume of reconstituted BLINCYTO). Gently mix the \n\ncontents of the bag to avoid foaming. Discard any remaining BLINCYTO reconstituted \n\nsolution. \n\n6. Under aseptic conditions, attach the intravenous tubing to the infusion bag with the sterile \n0.2 micron in-line filter.  \n\n7. Remove air from the infusion bag and prime the intravenous infusion line only with the \nprepared solution for infusion. Do not prime with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection.  \n\n8. Store at 2°C – 8°C if not used immediately. \n \n\nFor instructions on administration, see Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.2. \n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nImportant Note: Do not flush the BLINCYTO infusion line or intravenous catheter, especially \n\nwhen changing infusion bags. Flushing when changing bags or at completion of infusion can \n\nresult in excess dosage and complications thereof. When administering via multi-lumen venous \n\ncatheter, BLINCYTO should be infused through a dedicated lumen.  \n\n \n\nBLINCYTO solution for infusion is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion delivered at a \n\nconstant flow rate using an infusion pump over a period of up to 96 hours.  \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nThe BLINCYTO solution for infusion must be administered using intravenous tubing that contains a \n\nsterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding 0.2 micrometre in-line filter. \n\n \n\nThe infusion bag must be changed at least every 96 hours by a healthcare professional for sterility \n\nreasons. \n\n \n\nStorage conditions and shelf life \n\n \n\nUnopened vials:  \n\n \n\n5 years (2°C - 8°C) \n\n \n\nReconstituted solution: \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C or 4 hours at \n\nor below 27°C. \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstituting precludes the risks of \n\nmicrobial contamination, the reconstituted solution should be diluted immediately. If not diluted \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n\n \n\nDiluted solution (prepared infusion bag)  \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 10 days at 2°C - 8°C or 96 hours at \n\nor below 27°C. \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion bags should be used immediately. If not \n\nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \n\nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in \n\ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
