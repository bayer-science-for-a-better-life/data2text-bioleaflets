NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPegasys 180 micrograms solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nPegasys 180 micrograms solution for injection\nEach vial of 1 ml solution contains 180 micrograms peginterferon alfa-2a*. \n\nThe strength indicates the quantity of the interferon alfa-2a moiety of peginterferon alfa-2a without \nconsideration of the pegylation.\n\n*The active substance, peginterferon alfa-2a, is a covalent conjugate of the protein interferon alfa-2a \nproduced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli with bis-[monomethoxy polyethylene \nglycol].\n\nThe potency of this medicinal product should not be compared to the one of another pegylated or non-\npegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1.\n\nExcipient with known effect: Benzyl alcohol (10 mg/ 1 ml)\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\n\nThe solution is clear and colourless to light yellow.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\n\nAdult patients\n\nPegasys is indicated for the treatment of hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-\nnegative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adult patients with compensated liver disease and evidence of \nviral replication, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically verified liver \ninflammation and/or fibrosis (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nPaediatric patients 3 years of age and older\n\nPegasys is indicated for the treatment of HBeAg-positive CHB in non-cirrhotic children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older with evidence of viral replication and persistently elevated serum \nALT levels. With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric patients see sections 4.2, 4.4 \nand 5.1.\n\n\n\n3\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nAdult patients\n\nPegasys is indicated in combination with other medicinal products, for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) in patients with compensated liver disease (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype specific activity, see sections 4.2 and 5.1.\n\nPaediatric patients 5 years of age and older\n\nPegasys in combination with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of CHC in treatment-naïve \nchildren and adolescents 5 years of age and older who are positive for serum HCV-RNA.\n\nWhen deciding to initiate treatment in childhood, it is important to consider growth inhibition induced \nby combination therapy. The reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. The decision to treat \nshould be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated only by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with \nhepatitis B or C.\n\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products that are used in \ncombination with Pegasys.\n\nMonotherapy for hepatitis C should only be considered in case of contraindication to other medicinal \nproducts.\n\nPosology\n\nChronic hepatitis B – adult patients\n\nThe recommended dosage and duration of Pegasys for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative \nCHB is 180 micrograms once weekly for 48 weeks. For information on predictive values for on-\ntreatment response, see section 5.1.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nTreatment-naïve adult patients\n\nThe recommended dose for Pegasys is 180 micrograms once weekly given in combination with oral \nribavirin or as monotherapy.\n\nThe dose of ribavirin to be used in combination with Pegasys is given in Table 1.\nThe ribavirin dose should be administered with food.\n\nDuration of treatment – dual therapy with Pegasys and ribavirin\n\nThe duration of combination therapy with ribavirin for CHC depends on viral genotype. Patients \ninfected with HCV genotype 1 who have detectable HCV RNA at week 4 regardless of pre-treatment \nviral load should receive 48 weeks of therapy.\nTreatment for 24 weeks may be considered in patients infected with\n- genotype 1 with low viral load (LVL) ( 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline or\n- genotype 4\nwho become HCV RNA negative at week 4 and remain HCV RNA negative at week 24. However, an \noverall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks \n\n\n\n4\n\ntreatment duration (see section 5.1). In these patients, tolerability to combination therapy and \nadditional prognostic factors such as degree of fibrosis should be taken into account when deciding on \ntreatment duration. Shortening the treatment duration in patients with genotype 1 and high viral load \n(HVL) (>800, 000 IU/ml) at baseline who become HCV RNA negative at week 4 and remain HCV \nRNA negative at week 24 should be considered with even more caution since the limited data \navailable suggest that this may significantly negatively impact the sustained virologic response.\n\nPatients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 who have detectable HCV RNA at week 4, regardless of \npre-treatment viral load should receive 24 weeks of therapy. Treatment for only 16 weeks may be \nconsidered in selected patients infected with genotype 2 or 3 with LVL ( 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline \nwho become HCV negative by week 4 of treatment and remains HCV negative by week 16. Overall \n16 weeks of treatment may be associated with a lower chance of response and is associated with a \nhigher risk of relapse than a 24-week treatment duration (see section 5.1). In these patients, tolerability \nto combination therapy and the presence of additional clinical or prognostic factors such as degree of \nfibrosis should be taken into account when considering deviations from standard 24 weeks treatment \nduration. Shortening the treatment duration in patients infected with genotype 2 or 3 with HVL \n(> 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline who become HCV negative by week 4 should be considered with more \ncaution as this may significantly negatively impact the sustained virological response (see Table 1). \n\nAvailable data for patients infected with genotype 5 or 6 are limited; therefore combination treatment \nwith 1,000/1,200 mg of ribavirin for 48 weeks is recommended.\n\nTable 1: Dosing recommendations for combination therapy for adult patients with chronic \nhepatitis C\nGenotype Pegasys dose Ribavirin dose Duration\nGenotype 1 LVL \nwith RVR* \n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n24 weeks or\n48 weeks\n\nGenotype 1 HVL \nwith RVR* \n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n48 weeks \n\nGenotype 4 with \nRVR*\n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n24 weeks or\n48 weeks\n\nGenotype 1 or 4 \nwithout RVR*\n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n48 weeks\n\nGenotype 2 or 3 \nwithout RVR**\n\n180 micrograms 800 mg 24 weeks\n\nGenotype 2 or 3 \nLVL with RVR**\n\n180 micrograms 800 mg(a) 16 weeks(a) or 24 \nweeks\n\nGenotype 2 or 3 \nHVL with RVR**\n\n180 micrograms 800 mg 24 weeks\n\n*RVR = rapid viral response (HCV RNA undetectable) at week 4 and HCV RNA undetectable at week 24;\n**RVR = rapid viral response (HCV RNA negative) by week 4\nLVL = ≤ 800,000 IU/ml; HVL = > 800,000 IU/ml\n(a) It is presently not clear whether a higher dose of ribavirin (e.g.1000/1200 mg/day based on body weight) results in higher \nSVR rates than does the 800 mg/day, when treatment is shortened to 16 weeks.\n\nThe ultimate clinical impact of a shortened initial treatment of 16 weeks instead of 24 weeks is \nunknown, taking into account the need for re-treating non-responding and relapsing patients.\n\nThe recommended duration of Pegasys monotherapy is 48 weeks.\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\n\nThe recommended dose of Pegasys in combination with ribavirin is 180 mcg once weekly by \nsubcutaneous administration. For patients <75 kg and 75 kg, 1000 mg daily and 1200 mg daily of \nribavirin, respectively, and regardless of genotype, should be administered.\nPatients who have detectable virus at week 12 should stop therapy. The recommended total duration of \ntherapy is 48 weeks. If patients infected with virus genotype 1, not responding to prior treatment with \n\n\n\n5\n\npeginterferon and ribavirin are considered for treatment, the recommended total duration of therapy is \n72 weeks (see section 5.1).\n\nHIV-HCV co-infected adult patients\n\nThe recommended dosage for Pegasys, alone or in combination with ribavirin, is 180 micrograms once \nweekly subcutaneously for 48 weeks. For patients infected with HCV genotype 1 <75 kg and 75 kg, \n1000 mg daily and 1200 mg daily of ribavirin, respectively, should be administered. Patients infected \nwith HCV genotypes other than genotype 1 should receive 800 mg daily of ribavirin. A duration of \ntherapy less than 48 weeks has not been adequately studied.\n\nDuration of therapy when Pegasys is used in combination with other medicinal products\n\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products that are used in \ncombination with Pegasys.\n\nPredictability of response and non-response with Pegasys and ribavirin dual therapy – treatment-\nnaïve patients\n\nEarly virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of \nHCV RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (see Tables 2 and 13).\n\nTable 2: Predictive value of week 12 virological response at the recommended dosing regimen \nwhile on Pegasys combination therapy in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C\n\nGenotype Negative Positive\nNo \n\nresponse \nby week \n\n12\n\nNo \nsustained \nresponse\n\nPredictive \nValue\n\nResponse \nby week \n\n12\nSustained \nresponse\n\nPredictive \nValue\n\nGenotype 1 \n(N= 569)\n\n102 97 95%\n(97/102)\n\n467 271 58%\n(271/467)\n\nGenotype 2 and 3 \n(N=96) 3 3\n\n100%\n(3/3) 93 81\n\n87%\n(81/93)\n\nThe negative predictive value for sustained response in patients treated with Pegasys in monotherapy \nwas 98%.\nA similar negative predictive value has been observed in HIV-HCV co-infected patients treated with \nPegasys monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin (100% (130/130) or 98% (83/85), respectively). \nPositive predictive values of 45% (50/110) and 70% (59/84) were observed for genotype 1 and \ngenotype 2/3 HIV-HCV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.\n\nPredictability of response and non-response with Pegasys and ribavirin dual therapy – treatment-\nexperienced patients\n\nIn non-responder patients re-treated for 48 or 72 weeks, viral suppression at week 12 (undetectable \nHCV RNA defined as <50 IU/ml) has been shown to be predictive for sustained virological response. \nThe probabilities of not achieving a sustained virological response with 48 or 72 weeks of treatment if \nviral suppression was not achieved at week 12 were 96% (363 of 380) and 96% (324 of 339), \nrespectively. The probabilities of achieving a sustained virological response with 48 or 72 weeks of \ntreatment if viral suppression was achieved at week 12 were 35% (20 of 57) and 57% (57 of 100),\nrespectively.\n\nDose adjustment for adverse reactions in adult patients\n\nGeneral\nWhere dose adjustment is required for moderate to severe adverse reactions (clinical and/or \nlaboratory) initial dose reduction to 135 micrograms is generally adequate for adult patients. In some \n\n\n\n6\n\ncases, dose reduction to 90 micrograms or 45 micrograms is necessary. Dose increases to or towards \nthe original dose may be considered when the adverse reaction abates (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nHaematological (see also Table 3)\nFor adults, dose reduction is recommended if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 500 to \n< 750 cells/mm3. For patients with ANC < 500 cells/mm3 treatment should be suspended until ANC \nvalues return to > 1000 cells/mm3. Therapy should initially be re-instituted at 90 micrograms Pegasys \nand the neutrophil count monitored. \n\nDose reduction to 90 micrograms is recommended if the platelet count is 25,000 to < 50,000 cells/mm3. \nTreatment discontinuation is recommended when platelet count decreases to levels < 25,000 cells/mm3.\n\nSpecific recommendations for management of treatment-emergent anaemia in adults are as follows: \nribavirin should be reduced to 600 milligrams/day (200 milligrams in the morning and 400 milligrams \nin the evening) if either of the following apply: (1) a patient without significant cardiovascular disease \nexperiences a fall in haemoglobin to < 10 g/dl and ≥ 8.5 g/dl, or (2) a patient with stable \ncardiovascular disease experiences a fall in haemoglobin by ≥ 2 g/dl during any 4 weeks of treatment. \nA return to original dosing is not recommended. Ribavirin should be discontinued if either of the \nfollowing applies: (1) a patient without significant cardiovascular disease experiences a fall in \nhaemoglobin confirmed to < 8.5 g/dl; (2) a patient with stable cardiovascular disease maintains a \nhaemoglobin value < 12 g/dl despite 4 weeks on a reduced dose. If the abnormality is reversed, \nribavirin may be restarted at 600 milligrams daily, and further increased to 800 milligrams daily at the \ndiscretion of the treating physician. A return to original dosing is not recommended.\n\nTable 3: Dose adjustment for adverse reactions in adult patients (for further guidance see also \ntext above)\n\nReduce \nribavirin\n\nto 600 mg\n\nWithhold\nribavirin\n\nReduce Pegasys\nto 135/90/45\nmicrograms\n\nWithhold\nPegasys\n\nDiscontinue \ncombination\n\nAbsolute\nNeutrophil \nCount \n\n500 to < 750\ncells/mm3\n\n< 500\ncells/mm3\n\nPlatelet Count 25,000 to \n< 50,000\ncells/mm3 \n\n< 25,000\ncells/mm3\n\nHaemoglobin\n- no cardiac \n\ndisease\n\n< 10 g/dl, and \n≥ 8.5 g/dl\n\n< 8.5 g/dl\n\nHaemoglobin\n- stable cardiac \n\ndisease\n\ndecrease \n≥ 2 g/dl during \nany 4 weeks\n\n< 12 g/dl \ndespite 4 weeks \nat reduced dose\n\nIn case of intolerance to ribavirin, Pegasys monotherapy should be continued.\n\nLiver function\nFluctuations in abnormalities of liver function tests are common in patients with CHC. Increases in \nALT levels above baseline (BL) have been observed in patients treated with Pegasys, including \npatients with a virological response.\nIn CHC clinical trials with adult patients, isolated increases in ALT (≥ 10x upper limit of normal \n[ULN], or ≥ 2x BL for patients with a BL ALT ≥ 10x ULN) which resolved without dose-modification \nwere observed in 8 of 451 patients treated with combination therapy. If ALT increase is progressive or \npersistent, the dose should be reduced initially to 135 micrograms. When increases in ALT levels are \nprogressive despite dose reduction, or are accompanied by increased bilirubin or evidence of hepatic \ndecompensation, therapy should be discontinued (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n7\n\nFor CHB patients, transient flares of ALT levels sometimes exceeding 10x ULN are not uncommon, \nand may reflect immune clearance. Treatment should normally not be initiated if ALT is >10x ULN. \nConsideration should be given to continuing treatment with more frequent monitoring of liver function \nduring ALT flares. If the Pegasys dose is reduced or withheld, therapy can be restored once the flare is \nsubsiding (see section 4.4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nAdjustments in the recommended dosage of 180 micrograms once weekly are not necessary when \ninstituting Pegasys therapy in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A reduced \ndose of 135 mcg once weekly is recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment or end \nstage renal disease (see section 5.2). Regardless of the starting dose or degree of renal impairment, \npatients should be monitored and appropriate dose reductions of Pegasys during the course of therapy \nshould be made in the event of adverse reactions.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with compensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh A), Pegasys has been shown to be effective \nand safe. Pegasys has not been evaluated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh B \nor C or bleeding oesophageal varices) (see section 4.3).\n\nThe Child-Pugh classification divides patients into groups A, B, and C, or \"Mild\", \"Moderate\" and \n\"Severe\" corresponding to scores of 5-6, 7-9 and 10-15, respectively.\n\nModified Assessment\n\nAssessment Degree of abnormality Score\nEncephalopathy None\n\nGrade 1-2\nGrade 3-4*\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nAscites Absent\nSlight\nModerate\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nS-Bilirubin (mg/dl)\n\nSI unit = mol/l)\n\n<2\n2.0-3 \n>3\n\n<34 \n34-51 \n>51\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nS-Albumin (g/dl) >3.5 \n3.5-2.8 \n<2.8\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nINR <1.7 \n1.7-2.3\n>2.3\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\n*Grading according to Trey, Burns and Saunders (1966)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nPegasys is contraindicated in neonates and young children up to 3 years old due to the excipient \nbenzyl alcohol (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n\n\n8\n\nIt is recommended that Pegasys pre-filled syringes be used for paediatric patients. The Pegasys pre-\nfilled pens do not allow for appropriate adjustment of dosing in these patients. Patients who initiate \ntreatment prior to their 18th birthday should maintain paediatric dosing through the completion of \ntherapy.\n\nThe posology of Pegasys in paediatric patients is based on the Body Surface Area (BSA). To calculate \nBSA, it is recommended to use Mosteller’s equation:\n\nThe recommended duration of therapy is 48 weeks in patients with CHB.\nBefore initiating therapy for CHB, persistently elevated serum ALT levels should have been \ndocumented. The response rate was lower in patients with no to minimal increase in ALT level at \nbaseline (see Section 5.1). \n\nThe duration of treatment with Pegasys in combination with ribavirin in paediatric patients with CHC \ndepends on viral genotype.  Patients infected with viral genotypes 2 or 3 should receive 24 weeks of \ntreatment, while patients infected with any other genotype should receive 48 weeks of therapy.\nPatients who still have detectable levels of HCV-RNA despite an initial 24 weeks of therapy, should \ndiscontinue therapy, as it is unlikely they will be able to achieve a sustained virological response with \ncontinued therapy.\n\nFor children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years with CHB and having a BSA greater than 0.54 m2 and \nfor children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years with CHC and having a BSA greater than 0.71 m2, the \nrecommended doses for Pegasys are provided in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Pegasys dosing recommendations for paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B and \nchronic hepatitis C\n\nBody Surface Area (BSA) range (m2)\nWeekly dose (mcg)\n\nCHC CHB\n0.71-0.74 0.54-0.74 65\n\n0.75-1.08 90\n1.09-1.51 135\n\n>1.51 180\n\nFor paediatric patients, based on toxicities, up to three levels of dose modification can be made before \ndose interruption or discontinuation is considered (see Table 5).\n\nTable 5: Pegasys dose modification recommendations in paediatric patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C\n\nStarting dose\n(mcg)\n\n1 level reduction\n(mcg)\n\n2 level reduction\n(mcg)\n\n3 level reduction\n(mcg)\n\n65 45 30 20\n90 65 45 20\n\n135 90 65 30\n180 135 90 45\n\n\n\n9\n\nRecommendations for dose modifications of Pegasys for toxicities in the CHB and CHC paediatric \npopulations are presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6: Pegasys dose modification recommendations for toxicities in paediatric patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C\n\nToxicity Pegasys Dose Modification\nNeutropenia 500 to < 750 cells/mm3: Immediate 1 level adjustment.\n\n250 to < 500 cells/mm3: interrupt dosing until ≥ 1000 cells/mm3, then \nresume dose with 2 level adjustments and monitor.\n\n< 250 cells/mm3 (or febrile neutropenia): discontinue treatment.\n\nThrombocytopenia Platelet 25,000 to <50,000 cells/mm3: 2 level adjustment.\nPlatelet <25,000 cells/mm3: discontinue treatment.\n\nIncreased alanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT)\n\nFor persistent or increasing elevations ≥5 but <10 x ULN, reduce dose \nwith a 1 level adjustment and monitor weekly ALT level to ensure it is \nstable or decreasing.\n\nFor persistent ALT values ≥10 x ULN discontinue treatment.\n\nDose adjustement in paediatric patients – dual therapy with Pegasys and ribavirin\n\nFor children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years with CHC, the recommended dose of ribavirin is \nbased on the patient’s body weight, with a target dose of 15 mg/kg/day, divided in two daily doses. \nFor children and adolescents 23 kg or greater, a dosing schedule using 200 mg ribavirin tablets is \nprovided in Table 7. Patients and caregivers must not attempt to break the 200 mg tablets.\n\nTable 7: Ribavirin dosing recommendations for paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C \naged 5 to 17 years\n\nBody weight kg (lbs) Ribavirin daily dose\n(Approx. 15 mg/kg/day)\n\nRibavirin number of tablets\n\n23 – 33 (51-73) 400 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n1 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n34 – 46 (75-101) 600 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n47 – 59 (103-131) 800 mg/day 2 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n60 – 74 (132-163) 1000 mg/day 2 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n3 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n≥75 (>165) 1200 mg/day 3 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n3 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\nIt is important to note that ribavirin should never be given as monotherapy. Unless otherwise noted, \nthe management of all other toxicities should follow the adult recommendations.\n\nIn paediatric patients, ribavirin treatment-associated toxicities, such as treatment-emergent anaemia, \nwill be managed by reduction of the full dose. The dose reduction levels are provided in Table 8.\n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 8: Ribavirin dose modification recommendations in paediatric patients with chronic \nhepatitis C\n\nFull dose\n(Approx. 15 mg/kg/day)\n\nOne step dose modification\n(Approx. 7.5 mg/kg/day)\n\nRibavirin number of tablets\n\n400 mg/day 200 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n\n600 mg/day 400 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n1 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n800 mg/day 400 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n1 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n1000 mg/day 600 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n1200 mg/day 600 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\nThere is limited experience with Pegasys in treating paediatric patients with CHC aged 3 to 5 years, or \nwho have failed to be adequately treated previously. There are no data in paediatric patients coinfected \nwith HCV/HIV or with renal impairment.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPegasys is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh. Exposure to Pegasys was decreased \nin studies following administration of Pegasys in the arm (see section 5.2).\n\nPegasys is designed for administration by the patient or carer. Each vial should be used by one person \nonly and is for single use.\n\nAppropriate training is recommended for non-healthcare professionals administering this medicinal \nproduct. The “Instructions for the User”, provided in the carton, must be followed carefully by the \npatient.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to alfa interferons, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1\n\n Autoimmune hepatitis\n Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver\n A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac \n\ndisease in the previous six months (see section 4.4)\n HIV-HCV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh score ≥ 6, except if only due to indirect \n\nhyperbilirubinemia caused by medicinal products such as atazanavir and indinavir\n Combination with telbivudine (see section 4.5)\n Neonates and young children up to 3 years old, because of the excipient benzyl alcohol (see \n\nsection 4.4 for benzyl alcohol)\n In paediatric patients, the presence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly \n\nsevere depression, suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt.\n\n\n\n11\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, \nsuicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Pegasys therapy, \nand even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Other CNS \neffects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal \nideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed \nwith alfa interferons. All patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of \npsychiatric disorders. If symptoms of psychiatric disorders appear, the potential seriousness of these \nundesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with Pegasys be discontinued, and the patient \nfollowed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: If treatment with Pegasys is \njudged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should \nonly be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic\nmanagement of the psychiatric condition.\nThe use of Pegasys in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric \nconditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse: HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use \ndisorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or \nexacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alfa interferon. If treatment \nwith alfa interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities \nand the potential for other substance use should be carefully assessed and adequately managed before \ninitiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider \nor addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should \nbe closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment discontinuation. Early intervention for \nre-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents):\n\nDuring therapy with Pegasys +/- ribavirin lasting up to 48 weeks in patients aged 3 to 17 years, \nweight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed \nfor children and adolescents in the clinical trials on a case by case basis (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). It \nis important to consider the treatment with Pegasys +/- ribavirin induced a growth inhibition during \ntreatment, the reversibility of which is uncertain.\n\nThe risk of growth inhibition should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such \nas evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (for HBV-\ninfection mainly HBV genotype and ALT levels; for HCV-infection mainly HCV genotype and \nHCV-RNA levels) (see section 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long-term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file.\n\nLaboratory tests prior to and during therapy\nPrior to beginning Pegasys therapy, standard haematological and biochemical laboratory tests are \nrecommended for all patients.\n\n\n\n12\n\nThe following may be considered as baseline values for initiation of treatment:\n- Platelet count  90,000 cells/mm3\n\n- ANC  1500 cells/mm3\n\n- Adequately controlled thyroid function (TSH and T4)\n\nHaematological tests should be repeated after 2 and 4 weeks and biochemical tests should be \nperformed at 4 weeks. Additional testing should be performed periodically during therapy (including \nglucose monitoring).\n\nIn clinical trials, Pegasys treatment was associated with decreases in both total white blood cell \n(WBC) count and ANC, usually starting within the first 2 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). \nProgressive decreases after 8 weeks of therapy were infrequent. The decrease in ANC was reversible \nupon dose reduction or cessation of therapy (see section 4.2), reached normal values by 8 weeks in the \nmajority of patients and returned to baseline in all patients after about 16 weeks.\n\nPegasys treatment has been associated with decreases in platelet count, which returned to pre-\ntreatment levels during the post-treatment observation period (see section 4.8). In some cases, dose \nmodification may be necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nThe occurrence of anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g/dl) has been observed in up to 15% of CHC patients \nin clinical trials on the combined treatment of Pegasys with ribavirin. The frequency depends on the \ntreatment duration and the dose of ribavirin (see section 4.8). The risk of developing anaemia is higher \nin the female population.\n\nCaution should be exercised when administering Pegasys in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to \n7 weeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This \nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon re-introduction of either treatment alone (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nThe use of Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy in CHC patients who failed prior treatment has \nnot been adequately studied in patients who discontinued prior therapy for haematological adverse \nreactions. Physicians considering treatment in these patients should carefully weigh the risks versus \nthe benefits of re-treatment.\n\nEndocrine system\nThyroid function abnormalities or worsening of pre-existing thyroid disorders have been reported with \nthe use of alfa interferons, including Pegasys. Prior to initiation of Pegasys therapy, TSH and T4 levels \nshould be evaluated. Pegasys treatment may be initiated or continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by pharmaceutical means. TSH levels should be determined during the course of \ntherapy if a patient develops clinical symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction (see \nsection 4.8). Hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus have been observed with Pegasys \n(see section 4.8). Patients with these conditions who cannot be effectively controlled by medication \nshould not begin Pegasys monotherapy or Pegasys/ribavirin combination therapy. Patients who \ndevelop these conditions during treatment and cannot be controlled with medication should \ndiscontinue Pegasys or Pegasys/ribavirin therapy.\n\nCardiovascular system\nHypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, chest pain and myocardial \ninfarction have been associated with alfa interferon therapies, including Pegasys. It is recommended \nthat patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have an electrocardiogram prior to initiation \nof Pegasys therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, therapy should be suspended \nor discontinued. In patients with cardiovascular disease, anaemia may necessitate dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation of ribavirin (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n13\n\nLiver function\nIn patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation during treatment, Pegasys should be \ndiscontinued. Increases in ALT levels above baseline have been observed in patients treated with \nPegasys, including patients with a viral response. When the increase in ALT levels is progressive and \nclinically significant, despite dose reduction, or is accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, therapy \nshould be discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nIn CHB, unlike CHC, disease exacerbations during therapy are not uncommon and are characterised \nby transient and potentially significant increases in serum ALT. In clinical trials with Pegasys in HBV, \nmarked transaminase flares have been accompanied by mild changes in other measures of hepatic \nfunction and without evidence of hepatic decompensation. In approximately half the cases of flares \nexceeding 10x ULN, Pegasys dosing was reduced or withheld until the transaminase elevations \nsubsided, while in the rest therapy was continued unchanged. More frequent monitoring of hepatic \nfunction was recommended in all instances.\n\nHypersensitivity\nSerious, acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, \nanaphylaxis) have been rarely observed during alfa interferon therapy. If this occurs, therapy must be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical therapy instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not \nnecessitate interruption of treatment.\n\nAutoimmune disease\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alfa interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be re-assessed (see also \nEndocrine system in sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with CHC treated \nwith interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn \nand corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nFever/infections\nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must \nbe ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) and \nsepsis have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Pegasys. Appropriate anti-\ninfective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered.\n\nOcular changes\nRetinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, optic neuropathy and \nretinal artery or vein obstruction which may result in loss of vision have been reported in rare \ninstances with Pegasys. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of \ndecrease or loss of vision must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Adult and paediatric \npatients with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should \nreceive periodic ophthalmologic exams during Pegasys therapy. Pegasys treatment should be \ndiscontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.\n\nPulmonary changes\nPulmonary symptoms, including dyspnoea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, and pneumonitis have \nbeen reported during therapy with Pegasys. In case of persistent or unexplained pulmonary infiltrates \nor pulmonary function impairment, treatment should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n14\n\nSkin disorder\nUse of alfa interferons has been associated with exacerbation or provocation of psoriasis and \nsarcoidosis. Pegasys must be used with caution in patients with psoriasis, and in cases of onset or \nworsening of psoriatic lesions, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.\n\nTransplantation\nThe safety and efficacy of Pegasys and ribavirin treatment have not been established in patients with \nliver and other transplantations. Liver and renal graft rejections have been reported with Pegasys, \nalone or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nHIV-HCV co-infection\nPlease refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of \ntoxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with Pegasys with or \nwithout ribavirin. In study NR15961, patients concurrently treated with stavudine and interferon \ntherapy with or without ribavirin, the incidence of pancreatitis and/or lactic acidosis was 3% (12/398).\n\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be \nat increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should therefore be exercised when adding \nPegasys and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SmPC).\n\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may also be at increased risk of \nhepatic decompensation and possibly death if treated with ribavirin in combination with interferons, \nincluding Pegasys. Baseline variables in co-infected cirrhotic patients that may be associated with \nhepatic decompensation include: increased serum bilirubin, decreased haemoglobin, increased alkaline \nphosphatase or decreased platelet count, and treatment with didanosine (ddI).\n\nThe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of \nanaemia (see section 4.5).\n\nDuring treatment, co-infected patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic \ndecompensation (including ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, impaired hepatic synthetic \nfunction; e.g., Child-Pugh score of 7 or greater). The Child-Pugh scoring may be affected by factors \nrelated to treatment (i.e. indirect hyperbilirubinemia, decreased albumin) and not necessarily \nattributable to hepatic decompensation. Treatment with Pegasys should be discontinued immediately \nin patients with hepatic decompensation.\n\nIn patients co-infected with HIV-HCV, limited efficacy and safety data are available in patients with \nCD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low \nCD4 counts.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof Pegasys and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nUse of peginterferon as long term maintenance monotherapy (unapproved use)\nIn a randomised, controlled US study (HALT-C) of HCV non-responder patients with varied degrees \nof fibrosis where 3.5 years of treatment with 90 micrograms/week of Pegasys monotherapy was \nstudied, no significant reductions were observed in the rate of fibrosis progression or related clinical \nevents.\n\n\n\n15\n\nExcipient\nPegasys contains benzyl alcohol. Must not be given to premature babies or neonates. May cause toxic \nreactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nAdministration of Pegasys 180 micrograms once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy male subjects did not \nshow any effect on mephenytoin, dapsone, debrisoquine and tolbutamide pharmacokinetics profiles, \nsuggesting that Pegasys has no effect on in vivo metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C9, \n2C19 and 2D6 isozymes.\n\nIn the same study, a 25% increase in the AUC of theophylline (marker of cytochrome P450 1A2 \nactivity) was observed, demonstrating that Pegasys is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2 activity. \nSerum concentrations of theophylline should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments of \ntheophylline made for patients taking theophylline and Pegasys concomitantly. The interaction \nbetween theophylline and Pegasys is likely to be maximal after more than 4 weeks of Pegasys therapy.\n\nHCV monoinfected patients and HBV monoinfected patients\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of 24 HCV patients concomitantly receiving methadone maintenance \ntherapy (median dose 95 mg; range 30 mg to 150 mg), treatment with Pegasys 180 micrograms sc\nonce weekly for 4 weeks was associated with mean methadone levels that were 10% to 15% higher \nthan at baseline. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; nonetheless, patients should be \nmonitored for the signs and symptoms of methadone toxicity. Especially in patients on a high dose of \nmethadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.\n\nRibavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere \nwith azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine \nmonophosphate (6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with \nazathioprine. The use of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprin should be \navoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with \nazathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close haematologic monitoring be \ndone during concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment \nwith these medicinal products should be stopped (see section 4.4).\n\nResults from pharmacokinetic substudies of pivotal phase III trials demonstrated no pharmacokinetic \ninteraction of lamivudine on Pegasys in HBV patients or between Pegasys and ribavirin in HCV \npatients.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration for the treatment of HBV, \nindicates that the combination is associated with an increased risk for developing peripheral \nneuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known; thus, co-treatment with telbivudine and \nother interferons (pegylated or standard) may also entail an excess risk. Moreover, the benefit of the \ncombination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established.\nTherefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nHIV-HCV co-infected patients\n\nNo apparent evidence of drug interaction was observed in 47 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who \ncompleted a 12-week pharmacokinetic substudy to examine the effect of ribavirin on the intracellular \nphosphorylation of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine or \nstavudine). However, due to high variability, the confidence intervals were quite wide. Plasma \nexposure of ribavirin did not appear to be affected by concomitant administration of nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).\n\n\n\n16\n\nCo-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. Exposure to didanosine or its \nactive metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate) is increased in vitro when didanosine is co-\nadministered with ribavirin. Reports of fatal hepatic failure as well as peripheral neuropathy, \npancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactataemia/lactic acidosis have been reported with use of ribavirin.\n\nExacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral therapy \nregimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known \nhistory of zidovudine induced anaemia.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of peginterferon alfa-2a in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals with interferon alfa-2a have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) and the \npotential risk for humans is unknown. Pegasys is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nIt is unknown whether peginterferon alfa-2a/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to \ninitiation of treatment.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on the effects of peginterferon alfa-2a on fertility in women. A prolongation of the \nmenstrual cycle has been seen with peginterferon alfa-2a in female monkeys (see section 5.3).\n\nUse with ribavirin\nSignificant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species \nexposed to ribavirin. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care \nmust be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Pegasys in \ncombination with ribavirin. Female patients of childbearing potential must use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or \ntheir female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after \ntreatment has been concluded. Please refer to the ribavirin SmPC.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPegasys has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who \ndevelop dizziness, confusion, somnolence or fatigue should be cautioned to avoid driving or operating \nmachinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nChronic hepatitis B in adult patients\n\nIn clinical trials of 48 weeks treatment and 24 weeks follow-up, the safety profile for Pegasys in CHB\nwas similar to that seen in CHC. With the exception of pyrexia, the frequency of the majority of the \nreported adverse reactions was notably less in CHB patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy \n\n\n\n17\n\ncompared with CHC patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy (see Table 9). Adverse events were \nexperienced by 88% of Pegasys-treated patients as compared with 53% of patients in the lamivudine \ncomparator group, while 6% of the Pegasys-treated and 4% of the lamivudine-treated patients \nexperienced serious adverse events during the studies. Adverse events or laboratory abnormalities led \nto 5% of patients withdrawing from Pegasys treatment, while less than 1% of patients withdrew from \nlamivudine treatment for these reasons. The percentage of patients with cirrhosis who withdrew from \ntreatment was similar to that of the overall population in each treatment group.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\n\nThe frequency and severity of the most commonly reported adverse reactions with Pegasys are similar \nto those reported with interferon alfa-2a (see Table 9). The most frequently reported adverse reactions \nwith Pegasys 180 micrograms were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without \nthe need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in prior non-responder patients\n\nOverall, the safety profile for Pegasys in combination with ribavirin in prior non-responder patients \nwas similar to that in naïve patients. In a clinical trial of non-responder patients to prior pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin, which exposed patients to either 48 or 72 weeks of treatment, the \nfrequency of withdrawal for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities from Pegasys treatment and \nribavirin treatment was 6% and 7%, respectively, in the 48 week arms and 12% and 13%, respectively, \nin the 72 week arms. Similarly for patients with cirrhosis or transition to cirrhosis, the frequencies of \nwithdrawal from Pegasys treatment and ribavirin treatment were higher in the 72-week treatment arms \n(13% and 15%) than in the 48-week arms (6% and 6%). Patients who withdrew from previous therapy \nwith pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin because of haematological toxicity were excluded from \nenrolling in this trial.\n\nIn another clinical trial, non-responder patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak score of 3 to \n6) and baseline platelet counts as low as 50,000 cells/mm3 were treated for 48 weeks. Haematologic \nlaboratory abnormalities observed during the first 20 weeks of the trial included anaemia (26% of \npatients experienced a haemoglobin level of <10 g/dl), neutropenia (30% experienced an ANC \n<750 cells/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (13% experienced a platelet count <50,000 cells/mm3) (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nChronic hepatitis C and HIV co-infection\n\nIn HIV-HCV co-infected patients, the clinical adverse reaction profiles reported for Pegasys, alone or \nin combination with ribavirin, were similar to those observed in HCV mono-infected patients. For \nHIV-HCV patients receiving Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy other undesirable effects have \nbeen reported in ≥ 1% to ≤ 2% of patients: hyperlactacidaemia/lactic acidosis, influenza, pneumonia, \naffect lability, apathy, tinnitus, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cheilitis, acquired lipodystrophy and \nchromaturia. Pegasys treatment was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the \nfirst 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was \nreversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of Pegasys had no observable negative \nimpact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data are available \nin co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts <200/µl.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 9 summarises the undesirable effects reported with Pegasys monotherapy in CHB or CHC adult \npatients and with Pegasys in combination with ribavirin in CHC patients. Undesirable effects reported \nin clinical studies are grouped according to frequency as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000). For spontaneous reports of undesirable effects from post-marketing experience, the \nfrequency is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of seriousness.\n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 9: Undesirable effects reported with Pegasys monotherapy for CHB or CHC or in

see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nLaboratory values\nPegasys treatment was associated with abnormal laboratory values: ALT increase, bilirubin increase, \nelectrolyte disturbance (hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia), hyperglycaemia, \nhypoglycaemia and elevated triglycerides (see section 4.4.). With both Pegasys monotherapy, and also \nthe combined treatment with ribavirin, up to 2% of patients experienced increased ALT levels that led \nto dose modification or discontinuation of the treatment.\n\nTreatment with Pegasys was associated with decreases in haematological values (leucopenia, \nneutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and haemoglobin), which generally improved with dose \n\n\n\n21\n\nmodification, and returned to pre-treatment levels within 4-8 weeks upon cessation of therapy (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nModerate (ANC: 0.749 - 0.5 x 109/l) and severe (ANC: < 0.5 x 109/l) neutropenia was observed \nrespectively in 24% (216/887) and 5% (41/887) of patients receiving Pegasys 180 micrograms and \nribavirin 1000/1200 milligrams for 48 weeks.\n\nAnti-interferon antibodies\n1-5% of patients treated with Pegasys developed neutralising anti-interferon antibodies. As with other \ninterferons, a higher incidence of neutralising antibodies was seen in CHB. However in neither disease \nwas this correlated with lack of therapeutic response.\n\nThyroid function\nPegasys treatment was associated with clinically significant abnormalities in thyroid laboratory values \nrequiring clinical intervention (see section 4.4). The frequencies observed (4.9%) in patients receiving \nPegasys/ribavirin (NV15801) are similar to those observed with other interferons.\n\nLaboratory values for HIV-HCV co-infected patients\nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HIV-HCV patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and the use of \ngrowth factors and infrequently required premature discontinuation of treatment. Decrease in ANC \nlevels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 13% and 11% of patients receiving Pegasys monotherapy \nand combination therapy, respectively. Decrease in platelets below 50,000 cells/mm3 was observed in \n10% and 8% of patients receiving Pegasys monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. \nAnaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dl) was reported in 7% and 14% of patients treated with Pegasys \nmonotherapy or in combination therapy, respectively.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChronic hepatitis B \n\nIn a clinical trial (YV25718) with 111 paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with Pegasys \nfor 48 weeks, the safety profile was consistent with that seen in adults with CHB and in paediatric \npatients with CHC. \n\nThe mean changes from baseline in height and weight for age Z-scores at Week 48 of treatment in \nstudy YV25718 were -0.07 and -0.21 (n=108 and n= 106 respectively) for Pegasys-treated patients as \ncompared to -0.01 and -0.08 (n=47 each) in  untreated patients. At Week 48 of Pegasys treatment, a \nheight or weight percentile decrease of more than 15 percentiles on the normative growth curves was \nobserved in 6% of patients for height and 11% of patient for weight, whereas in the untreated group it \nwas 2% of patients for height and 9% for weight. No data is available on long-term follow-up post-\ntreatment in these patients (see section 4.4).\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nIn a clinical trial with 114 paediatric patients (5 to 17 years of age) treated with Pegasys alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (see section 5.1), dose modifications were required in approximately one-\nthird of patients, most commonly for neutropenia and anaemia. In general, the safety profile observed \nin paediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults. In the paediatric study, the most prevalent \nadverse reactions in patients treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with Pegasys and \nribavirin were influenza-like illness (91%), headache (64%), gastrointestinal disorder (56%), and \ninjection-site reaction (45%). A full listing of adverse reactions reported in this treatment group (n=55) \nis provided in Table 10. Seven patients receiving combination Pegasys and ribavirin treatment for 48 \nweeks discontinued therapy for safety reasons (depression, psychiatric evaluation abnormal, transient \nblindness, retinal exudates, hyperglycaemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and anaemia). Most of the \nadverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse reactions \n\n\n\n22\n\nwere reported in 2 patients in the Pegasys plus ribavirin combination therapy group (hyperglycaemia \nand cholecystectomy).\n\nGrowth inhibition was observed in paediatric patients (see section 4.4). Paediatric patients treated with \nPegasys plus ribavirin combination therapy showed a delay in weight and height increases after 48 \nweeks of therapy compared with baseline. Patient ‘weight for age’ and ‘height for age’ percentiles of \nthe normative population decreased during treatment. At the end of 2 years follow-up after treatment, \nmost patients had returned to baseline normative growth curve percentiles for weight and height (mean \nweight percentile was 64% at baseline and 60% at 2 years post-treatment; mean height percentile was \n54% at baseline and 56% at 2 years post-treatment). At the end of treatment, 43% of patients \nexperienced a weight percentile decrease of 15 percentiles or more, and 25% (13 of 53) experienced a \nheight percentile decrease of 15 percentiles or more on the normative growth curves. At 2 years post-\ntreatment, 16% (6 of 38) of patients remained 15 percentiles or more below their baseline weight \ncurve and 11% (4 of 38) remained 15 percentiles or more below their baseline height curve.\n\n55% (21 of 38) of subjects who completed the original study enrolled in the long-term follow up \nextending up to 6 years post-treatment. The study demonstrated that the post-treatment recovery in \ngrowth at 2 years post-treatment was maintained to 6 years post-treatment. For a few subjects who \nwere more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve at 2 years post-treatment, they either \nreturned to baseline comparable height percentiles at 6 years post-treatment or a non-treatment related \ncausative factor has been identified. The extent of available data is not sufficient to conclude that \ngrowth inhibition due to Pegasys exposure is always reversible.\n\nTable 10: Adverse reactions reported among paediatric patients infected with HCV and assigned \nto Pegasys plus ribavirin in study NV17424 \n\nBody system Very common Common\nInfections and infestations Infectious mononucleosis, \n\npharyngitis streptococcal, influenza, \ngastroenteritis viral, candidiasis, \ngastroenteritis, tooth abscess, \nhordeolum, urinary tract infection, \nnasopharyngitis\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nAnaemia\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite Hyperglycaemia, type 1 diabetes \nmellitus \n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Depression, anxiety, hallucination, \nabnormal behaviour, aggression, \nanger, attention deficit / \nhyperactivity disorder\n\nNervous system disorders Headache Dizziness, disturbance in attention, \nmigraine\n\nEye disorders Blindness transient, retinal \nexudates, visual impairment eye \nirritation, eye pain, eye pruritis\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Ear pain\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nDyspnoea, epistaxis\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Gastrointestinal disorder Abdominal pain upper, stomatitis, \nnausea, aphthous stomatitis, oral \ndisorder\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash, pruritus, alopecia Swollen face, drug eruption, \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nMusculoskeletal pain Back pain, pain in extremity\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Dysuria, incontinence, urinary tract \ndisorder\n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders\n\nVaginal discharge\n\n\n\n23\n\nBody system Very common Common\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nInfluenza-like illness, injection site \nreaction, irritability, fatigue\n\nPyrexia, vessel puncture site \nhaematoma, pain\n\nInvestigations Psychiatric evaluation abnormal\n\nSurgical and medical procedures Tooth extraction, cholecystectomy\n\nSocial circumstances Educational problem\n\nLaboratory values\nDecreases in haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets or increased ALT may require dose reduction or \npermanent discontinuation from treatment (see section 4.2). Most laboratory abnormalities noted \nduring the clinical trial returned to baseline levels shortly after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdoses involving between two injections on consecutive days (instead of weekly interval) up to \ndaily injections for 1 week (i.e., 1260 micrograms/week) have been reported. None of these patients \nexperienced unusual, serious or treatment-limiting events. Weekly doses of up to 540 and \n630 micrograms have been administered in renal cell carcinoma and chronic myelogenous leukaemia \nclinical trials, respectively. Dose limiting toxicities were fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia \nand thrombocytopenia, consistent with interferon therapy.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, interferons, ATC code: L03AB11\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe conjugation of PEG reagent (bis-monomethoxypolyethylene glycol) to interferon alfa-2a forms a \npegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys). Pegasys possesses the in vitro antiviral and antiproliferative \nactivities that are characteristic of interferon alfa-2a.\n\nInterferon alfa-2a is conjugated with bis-[monomethoxy polyethylene glycol] at a degree of \nsubstitution of one mole of polymer/mole of protein. The average molecular mass is approximately \n60,000 of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 20,000.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nHCV RNA levels decline in a biphasic manner in responding patients with hepatitis C who have \nreceived treatment with 180 micrograms Pegasys. The first phase of decline occurs 24 to 36 hours \nafter the first dose of Pegasys and is followed by the second phase of decline which continues over the \nnext 4 to 16 weeks in patients who achieve a sustained response. Ribavirin had no significant effect on \nthe initial viral kinetics over the first 4 to 6 weeks in patients treated with the combination of ribavirin \nand pegylated interferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nChronic hepatitis B\n\nPredictability of response\n\nA patient-level meta-analysis of 9 Pegasys clinical studies (n=1,423) in CHB HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg-negative patients demonstrated that HBsAg and HBV DNA levels at Week 12 of treatment, \nare predictive of final treatment outcome at Week 24 post-treatment in certain genotypes. Operating \ncharacteristics of these biomarkers are presented in Table 11. No single biomarker with a cut-off can \nbe identified to optimize all the operating characteristics (negative predictive value [NPV], sensitivity, \nspecificity) and practical characteristics (simplicity, convenience). Consideration for early treatment \ndiscontinuation should be evaluated in the context of a particular clinical situation.\n\nFor HBeAg-positive patients with HBV genotype B and C infection, HBsAg > 20,000 IU/mL or HBV \nDNA > 8 log10 IU/mL at Week 12 following commencement of treatment is associated with high \nlikelihood of failure to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA <2,000 IU/mL at 24 week \npost-treatment (NPV > 90%). For HBV genotype A and D, subgroup size was insufficient to be \nanalyzed. \n\nFor HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype D infection, HBsAg > 20,000 IU/mL or HBV DNA \n> 6.5 log10 IU/mL at Week 12 following commencement of treatment is associated with high \nlikelihood of failure to achieve HBV-DNA <2,000 IU/mL and ALT normalization at Week 24 post \ntreatment. HBV genotype A subgroup size was insufficient to be analyzed. No biomarker can be \nidentified with acceptable performance for HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype B or C \ninfection. \n\nOther published on-treatment biomarkers that are predictive of the final outcome of Pegasys treatment \nmay be considered.\n\nTable 11: Performance of individual biomarkers at Week 12 of therapy in CHB HBeAg-positive \nand HBeAg-negative patients according to genotype\n\nGenotype Cut-off (IU/mL) NPV Sensitivity Specificity\n\nHBeAg-positive(a)\n\nB\nHBsAg > 20,000 0.93 0.96 0.23\n\nHBV DNA > 8 log10 0.90 0.94 0.26\n\nC\nHBsAg > 20,000 0.96 0.97 0.22\n\nHBV DNA > 8 log10 0.98 0.98 0.19\n\nHBeAg-negative(a)\n\nD\nHBsAg > 20,000 0.91 0.94 0.16\n\nHBV DNA > 6.5 log10 1.00 1.00 0.11\nNPV= negative predictive value; Sensitivity = % of all responders not meeting the stopping rule; Specificity = % of \nall non-responders meeting stopping rule\n(a) Treatment response for HBeAg-positive patients was defined as HBeAg seroconversion (defined as loss of \nHBeAg and presence of anti-HBe) + HBV DNA <2,000 IU/mL at 6 months post-treatment and treatment response \nfor HBeAg-negative patients was defined as HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL + ALT normalization at 6 months post-\ntreatment.\n\nAll clinical trials recruited patients with CHB who had active viral replication measured by HBV \nDNA, elevated levels of ALT and a liver biopsy consistent with chronic hepatitis. Study WV16240 \nrecruited patients who were positive for HBeAg, while study WV16241 recruited patients who were \nnegative for HBeAg and positive for anti-HBe. In both studies the treatment duration was 48 weeks, \nwith 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Both studies compared Pegasys plus placebo vs Pegasys \nplus lamivudine vs lamivudine alone. No HBV-HIV co-infected patients were included in these \nclinical trials.\n\n\n\n25\n\nResponse rates at the end of follow-up for the two studies are presented in Table 12. In study \nWV16240, the primary efficacy endpoints were HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA below 105\n\ncopies/ml. In study WV16241, the primary efficacy endpoints were ALT normalisation and HBV-\nDNA below 2 x 104 copies/ml.

The safety \nprofiles in both ribavirin groups were consistent with the known safety profile of Pegasys plus \nribavirin combination treatment and not indicative of any relevant differences, with the exception of a \nslight increase in anaemia in the high dose ribavirin arm.\n\nHCV patients with normal ALT\nIn study NR16071, HCV patients with normal ALT values were randomised to receive Pegasys \n180 micrograms/week and ribavirin 800 milligrams/day for either 24 or 48 weeks followed by a 24 \nweek treatment free follow-up period or no treatment for 72 weeks.

Patients with cirrhosis were \nnot enrolled in this study. A total of 151 patients without advanced fibrosis were 2:1 randomized to \nPegasys (group A, n=101) or untreated control (group B, n=50), respectively. Patients with advanced \nfibrosis were assigned to Pegasys treatment (group C, n=10). Patients in groups A and C (n=111) were \ntreated with Pegasys once weekly for 48 weeks according to BSA categories, whereas patients in \ngroup B were observed for a period of 48 weeks (principal observation period). Patients in group B \nhad the choice to switch to treatment with Pegasys after Week 48 of the principal observation period. \nAll patients were followed up for 24 weeks post-treatment (groups A and C), or post-principal \nobservation period (group B).

Preliminary and limited safety data demonstrated no obvious departure from the \nknown safety profile of the combination in adults with chronic HCV infection, but, importantly, the \npotential impact on growth has not been reported. Efficacy results were similar to those reported in \nadults.\n\nIn the NV17424 (PEDS-C) study, previously untreated paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age (55% \n<12 years old) with compensated CHC and detectable HCV RNA were treated with Pegasys 180 mcg \nx BSA/1.73 m2 once weekly for 48 weeks with or without ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day. All patients were \nfollowed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 55 patients received initial combination treatment of \nPegasys plus ribavirin, of whom 51% were female, 82% were Caucasian, and 82% were infected with \nHCV genotype 1. The study efficacy results for these patients are summarised in Table 25.\n\nTable 25: Sustained virological response in the NV17424 study\n\nPegasys\n\n180 mcg x BSA/1.73 m² + Ribavirin 15 \n\nmg/kg (N=55)*\n\nAll HCV genotypes** 29 (53%)\n\nHCV genotype 1 21/45 (47%)\n\nHCV genotype 2 and 3 8/10 (80%)\n\n*Results indicate undetectable HCV-RNA defined as HCV RNA less than 50 IU/ml at 24 weeks post-treatment using the \nAMPLICOR HCV test v2.\n**Scheduled treatment duration was 48 weeks regardless of the genotype\n\n\n\n34\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing a single subcutaneous injection of Pegasys 180 micrograms in healthy subjects, serum \nconcentrations of peginterferon alfa-2a are measurable within 3 to 6 hours. Within 24 hours, about \n80% of the peak serum concentration is reached. The absorption of Pegasys is sustained with peak \nserum concentrations reached 72 to 96 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of Pegasys is \n84% and is similar to that seen with interferon alfa-2a.\n\nDistribution\nPeginterferon alfa-2a is found predominantly in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid as seen by the \nvolume of distribution at steady-state (Vd) of 6 to 14 litres in humans after intravenous administration. \nFrom mass balance, tissue distribution and whole body autoradioluminography studies performed in \nrats, peginterferon alfa-2a is distributed to the liver, kidney and bone marrow in addition to being \nhighly concentrated in the blood.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe metabolism of Pegasys is not fully characterised; however studies in rats indicate that the kidney \nis a major organ for excretion of radiolabelled material. \n\nElimination\nIn humans, the systemic clearance of peginterferon alfa-2a is about 100-fold lower than that of the \nnative interferon alfa-2a. After intravenous administration, the terminal half-life of peginterferon alfa-\n2a in healthy subjects is approximately 60 to 80 hours compared to values of 3-4 hours for standard \ninterferon. The terminal half-life after subcutaneous administration in patients is longer with a mean \nvalue of 160 hours (84 to 353 hours). The terminal half-life may not only reflect the elimination phase \nof the compound, but may also reflect the sustained absorption of Pegasys.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nDose-proportional increases in exposure of Pegasys are seen in healthy subjects and in patients with\nchronic hepatitis B or C after once-weekly dosing.\n\nIn CHB or CHC patients, peginterferon alfa-2a serum concentrations accumulate 2 to 3 fold after 6 to \n8 weeks of once weekly dosing compared to single dose values. There is no further accumulation after \n8 weeks of once weekly dosing. The peak to trough ratio after 48 weeks of treatment is about 1.5 to 2. \nPeginterferon alfa-2a serum concentrations are sustained throughout one full week (168 hours).\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nA clinical trial evaluated 50 CHC patients with either moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) \nor severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment, or with end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) requiring chronic hemodialysis (HD). Patients with moderate renal impairment receiving \nPegasys 180 mcg once weekly exhibited similar peginterferon alfa-2a plasma exposures compared to \npatients with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment receiving Pegasys 180 mcg \nonce weekly showed a 60% higher peginterferon alfa-2a exposure than patients with normal renal \nfunction, therefore a reduced dose of Pegasys 135 mcg once weekly is recommended in patients with \nsevere renal impairment. In 13 patients with ESRD requiring chronic HD, administration of Pegasys \n135 mcg once weekly resulted in 34% lower peginterferon alfa-2a exposure than in patients with \nnormal renal function. However, several independent studies have demonstrated the 135mcg dose to \nbe safe, efficacious and well tolerated, in patients with ESRD (see section 4.2).\n\nGender\nThe pharmacokinetics of Pegasys after single subcutaneous injections was comparable between male \nand female healthy subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\nPegasys pharmacokinetics have been characterized in paediatric patients with CHB (YV25718), as \nwell as in paediatric patients with CHC (NR16141), using population pharmacokinetics.  In both \n\n\n\n35\n\nstudies, Pegasys apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution were related linearly to body \nsize ie. either BSA (NR16141) or body weight (YV25718).\n\nFrom the YV25718 study, 31 paediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age with CHB participated in the PK \nsub-study and received Pegasys according to a BSA category dosing regimen. Based on the population \npharmacokinetic model, the mean exposure (AUC) during the dosing interval for each BSA category \nwas comparable with that observed in adults receiving 180 mcg fixed dosing.\n\nFrom the NR16141study, 14 children 2 to 8 years of age with CHC received Pegasys monotherapy at a \ndose of: 180 mcg x BSA of the child/1.73 m2. The PK model developed from this study shows a linear \ninfluence of BSA on the apparent clearance of the drug over the age range studied. Thus, the lower the \nBSA of the child, the lower the clearance of the drug and the higher the resultant exposure. The mean \nexposure (AUC) during the dosing interval is predicted to be 25% to 70% higher than that observed in \nadults receiving 180 mcg fixed dosing.\n\nElderly\nIn subjects older than 62 years, the absorption of Pegasys after a single subcutaneous injection of \n180 micrograms was delayed but still sustained compared to young healthy subjects (tmax of 115 hours \nvs. 82 hours, older than 62 years vs. younger, respectively). The AUC was slightly increased (1663 vs. \n1295 ng·h/ml) but peak concentrations (9.1 vs. 10.3 ng/ml) were similar in subjects older than 62 \nyears. Based on drug exposure, pharmacodynamic response and tolerability, a lower dose of Pegasys is \nnot needed in the geriatric patient (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of Pegasys were similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatitis B \nor C. Comparable exposure and pharmacokinetic profiles were seen in cirrhotic (Child-Pugh Grade A) \nand non-cirrhotic patients.\n\nSite of administration\nSubcutaneous administration of Pegasys should be limited to the abdomen and thigh, as the extent of \nabsorption based on AUC was about 20% to 30% higher upon injection in the abdomen and thigh. \nExposure to Pegasys was decreased in studies following administration of Pegasys in the arm \ncompared to administration in the abdomen and thigh.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe non-clinical toxicity studies conducted with Pegasys were limited due to species specificity of \ninterferons. Acute and chronic toxicity studies have been carried out in cynomolgus monkeys, and the \nfindings observed in peginterferon dosed animals were similar in nature to those produced by \ninterferon alfa-2a.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with Pegasys. As with other alfa interferons, \nprolongation of the menstrual cycle was observed following administration of peginterferon alfa-2a to \nfemale monkeys. Treatment with interferon alfa-2a resulted in a statistically significant increase in \nabortifacient activity in rhesus monkeys. Although no teratogenic effects were seen in the offspring \ndelivered at term, adverse effects in humans cannot be excluded.\n\nPegasys plus ribavirin\nWhen used in combination with ribavirin, Pegasys did not cause any effects in monkeys not previously \nseen with either active substance alone. The major treatment-related change was reversible mild to \nmoderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance \nalone.\n\n\n\n36\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nChronic hepatitis B\n\nAdult patients\n\nPegasys is indicated for the treatment of hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-\nnegative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adult patients with compensated liver disease and evidence of \nviral replication, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically verified liver \ninflammation and/or fibrosis (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nPaediatric patients 3 years of age and older\n\nPegasys is indicated for the treatment of HBeAg-positive CHB in non-cirrhotic children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older with evidence of viral replication and persistently elevated serum \n\n\n\n39\n\nALT levels. With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric patients see sections 4.2, 4.4 \nand 5.1.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nAdult patients\n\nPegasys is indicated in combination with other medicinal products, for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) in patients with compensated liver disease (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype specific activity, see sections 4.2 and 5.1.\n\nPaediatric patients 5 years of age and older\n\nPegasys in combination with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of CHC in treatment-naïve \nchildren and adolescents 5 years of age and older who are positive for serum HCV-RNA.\n\nWhen deciding to initiate treatment in childhood, it is important to consider growth inhibition induced \nby combination therapy. The reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. The decision to treat \nshould be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated only by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with \nhepatitis B or C.\n\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products that are used in \ncombination with Pegasys.\n\nMonotherapy for hepatitis C should only be considered in case of contraindication to other medicinal \nproducts.\n\nPosology\n\nChronic hepatitis B – adult patients\n\nThe recommended dosage and duration of Pegasys for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative \nCHB is 180 micrograms once weekly for 48 weeks. For information on predictive values for on-\ntreatment response, see section 5.1.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nTreatment-naïve adult patients\n\nThe recommended dose for Pegasys is 180 micrograms once weekly given in combination with oral \nribavirin or as monotherapy.\n\nThe dose of ribavirin to be used in combination with Pegasys is given in Table 1.\nThe ribavirin dose should be administered with food.\n\nDuration of treatment – dual therapy with Pegasys and ribavirin\n\nThe duration of combination therapy with ribavirin for CHC depends on viral genotype. Patients \ninfected with HCV genotype 1 who have detectable HCV RNA at week 4 regardless of pre-treatment \nviral load should receive 48 weeks of therapy. \nTreatment for 24 weeks may be considered in patients infected with\n- genotype 1 with low viral load (LVL) ( 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline or\n\n\n\n40\n\n- genotype 4\nwho become HCV RNA negative at week 4 and remain HCV RNA negative at week 24. However, an \noverall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks \ntreatment duration (see section 5.1). In these patients, tolerability to combination therapy and \nadditional prognostic factors such as degree of fibrosis should be taken into account when deciding on \ntreatment duration. Shortening the treatment duration in patients with genotype 1 and high viral load \n(HVL) (>800, 000 IU/ml) at baseline who become HCV RNA negative at week 4 and remain HCV \nRNA negative at week 24 should be considered with even more caution since the limited data \navailable suggest that this may significantly negatively impact the sustained virologic response.\n\nPatients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 who have detectable HCV RNA at week 4, regardless of \npre-treatment viral load should receive 24 weeks of therapy. Treatment for only 16 weeks may be \nconsidered in selected patients infected with genotype 2 or 3 with LVL ( 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline \nwho become HCV negative by week 4 of treatment and remains HCV negative by week 16. Overall \n16 weeks of treatment may be associated with a lower chance of response and is associated with a \nhigher risk of relapse than a 24-week treatment duration (see section 5.1). In these patients, tolerability \nto combination therapy and the presence of additional clinical or prognostic factors such as degree of \nfibrosis should be taken into account when considering deviations from standard 24 weeks treatment \nduration. Shortening the treatment duration in patients infected with genotype 2 or 3 with HVL\n(> 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline who become HCV negative by week 4 should be considered with more \ncaution as this may significantly negatively impact the sustained virological response (see Table 1).\n\nAvailable data for patients infected with genotype 5 or 6 are limited; therefore combination treatment \nwith 1,000/1,200 mg of ribavirin for 48 weeks is recommended.\n\nTable 1: Dosing recommendations for combination therapy for adult patients with chronic \nhepatitis C\nGenotype Pegasys dose Ribavirin dose Duration\nGenotype 1 LVL \nwith RVR* \n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n24 weeks or\n48 weeks\n\nGenotype 1 HVL \nwith RVR* \n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n48 weeks \n\nGenotype 4 with \nRVR*\n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n24 weeks or\n48 weeks\n\nGenotype 1 or 4 \nwithout RVR*\n\n180 micrograms <75 kg = 1000 mg\n75 kg = 1200 mg\n\n48 weeks\n\nGenotype 2 or 3 \nwithout RVR**\n\n180 micrograms 800 mg 24 weeks\n\nGenotype 2 or 3 \nLVL with RVR**\n\n180 micrograms 800 mg(a) 16 weeks(a) or 24 \nweeks\n\nGenotype 2 or 3 \nHVL with RVR**\n\n180 micrograms 800 mg 24 weeks\n\n*RVR = rapid viral response (HCV RNA undetectable) at week 4 and HCV RNA undetectable at week 24; \n**RVR = rapid viral response (HCV RNA negative) by week 4\nLVL = ≤ 800,000 IU/ml; HVL = > 800,000 IU/ml\n(a) It is presently not clear whether a higher dose of ribavirin (e.g.1000/1200 mg/day based on body weight) results in higher \nSVR rates than does the 800 mg/day, when treatment is shortened to 16 weeks.\n\nThe ultimate clinical impact of a shortened initial treatment of 16 weeks instead of 24 weeks is \nunknown, taking into account the need for re-treating non-responding and relapsing patients.\n\n\n\n41\n\nThe recommended duration of Pegasys monotherapy is 48 weeks.\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\n\nThe recommended dose of Pegasys in combination with ribavirin is 180 mcg once weekly by \nsubcutaneous administration. For patients <75 kg and 75 kg, 1000 mg daily and 1200 mg daily of \nribavirin, respectively, and regardless of genotype, should be administered.\nPatients who have detectable virus at week 12 should stop therapy. The recommended total duration of \ntherapy is 48 weeks. If patients infected with virus genotype 1, not responding to prior treatment with \npeginterferon and ribavirin are considered for treatment, the recommended total duration of therapy is \n72 weeks (see section 5.1).\n\nHIV-HCV co-infected adult patients\n\nThe recommended dosage for Pegasys, alone or in combination with ribavirin, is 180 micrograms once \nweekly subcutaneously for 48 weeks. For patients infected with HCV genotype 1 <75 kg and 75 kg, \n1000 mg daily and 1200 mg daily of ribavirin, respectively, should be administered. Patients infected \nwith HCV genotypes other than genotype 1 should receive 800 mg daily of ribavirin. A duration of \ntherapy less than 48 weeks has not been adequately studied.\n\nDuration of therapy when Pegasys is used in combination with other medicinal products\n\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products that are used in \ncombination with Pegasys.\n\nPredictability of response and non-response with Pegasys and ribavirin dual therapy – treatment-\nnaïve patients\n\nEarly virological response by week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of \nHCV RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (see Tables 2 and 13).\n\nTable 2: Predictive value of week 12 virological response at the recommended dosing regimen \nwhile on Pegasys combination therapy in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C\n\nGenotype Negative Positive\nNo \n\nresponse \nby week \n\n12\n\nNo \nsustained \nresponse\n\nPredictive \nValue\n\nResponse \nby week \n\n12\nSustained \nresponse\n\nPredictive \nValue\n\nGenotype 1 \n(N= 569)\n\n102 97 95%\n(97/102)\n\n467 271 58% \n(271/467)\n\nGenotype 2 and 3 \n(N=96) 3 3\n\n100%\n(3/3) 93 81\n\n87%\n(81/93)\n\nThe negative predictive value for sustained response in patients treated with Pegasys in monotherapy \nwas 98%.\nA similar negative predictive value has been observed in HIV-HCV co-infected patients treated with \nPegasys monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin (100% (130/130) or 98% (83/85), respectively). \nPositive predictive values of 45% (50/110) and 70% (59/84) were observed for genotype 1 and \ngenotype 2/3 HIV-HCV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.\n\nPredictability of response and non-response with Pegasys and ribavirin dual therapy – treatment-\nexperienced patients\n\nIn non-responder patients re-treated for 48 or 72 weeks, viral suppression at week 12 (undetectable \nHCV RNA defined as <50 IU/ml) has been shown to be predictive for sustained virological response. \nThe probabilities of not achieving a sustained virological response with 48 or 72 weeks of treatment if \nviral suppression was not achieved at week 12 were 96% (363 of 380) and 96% (324 of 339), \n\n\n\n42\n\nrespectively. The probabilities of achieving a sustained virological response with 48 or 72 weeks of \ntreatment if viral suppression was achieved at week 12 were 35% (20 of 57) and 57% (57 of 100),\nrespectively.\n\nDose adjustment for adverse reactions in adult patients\n\nGeneral\nWhere dose adjustment is required for moderate to severe adverse reactions (clinical and/or \nlaboratory) initial dose reduction to 135 micrograms is generally adequate for adult patients. In some \ncases, dose reduction to 90 micrograms or 45 micrograms is necessary. Dose increases to or towards \nthe original dose may be considered when the adverse reaction abates (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nHaematological (see also Table 3)\nFor adults, dose reduction is recommended if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 500 to < 750\ncells/mm3. For patients with ANC < 500 cells/mm3 treatment should be suspended until ANC values \nreturn to > 1000 cells/mm3. Therapy should initially be re-instituted at 90 micrograms Pegasys and the \nneutrophil count monitored. \n\nDose reduction to 90 micrograms is recommended if the platelet count is 25,000 to < 50,000 cells/mm3. \nTreatment discontinuation is recommended when platelet count decreases to levels < 25,000 cells/mm3.\n\nSpecific recommendations for management of treatment-emergent anaemia in adults are as follows: \nribavirin should be reduced to 600 milligrams/day (200 milligrams in the morning and 400 milligrams \nin the evening) if either of the following apply: (1) a patient without significant cardiovascular disease \nexperiences a fall in haemoglobin to < 10 g/dl and ≥ 8.5 g/dl, or (2) a patient with stable \ncardiovascular disease experiences a fall in haemoglobin by ≥ 2 g/dl during any 4 weeks of treatment. \nA return to original dosing is not recommended. Ribavirin should be discontinued if either of the \nfollowing applies: (1) a patient without significant cardiovascular disease experiences a fall in \nhaemoglobin confirmed to < 8.5 g/dl; (2) a patient with stable cardiovascular disease maintains a \nhaemoglobin value < 12 g/dl despite 4 weeks on a reduced dose. If the abnormality is reversed, \nribavirin may be restarted at 600 milligrams daily, and further increased to 800 milligrams daily at the \ndiscretion of the treating physician. A return to original dosing is not recommended.\n\nTable 3: Dose adjustment for adverse reactions in adult patients (for further guidance see also \ntext above)\n\nReduce \nribavirin\n\nto 600 mg\n\nWithhold\nribavirin\n\nReduce Pegasys\nto 135/90/45 \nmicrograms\n\nWithhold\nPegasys\n\nDiscontinue \ncombination\n\nAbsolute\nNeutrophil \nCount \n\n500 to < 750\ncells/mm3\n\n< 500\ncells/mm3\n\nPlatelet Count 25,000 to \n< 50,000 \ncells/mm3 \n\n< 25,000\ncells/mm3\n\nHaemoglobin\n- no cardiac \n\ndisease\n\n< 10 g/dl, and \n≥ 8.5 g/dl\n\n< 8.5 g/dl\n\nHaemoglobin\n- stable cardiac \n\ndisease\n\ndecrease \n≥ 2 g/dl during \nany 4 weeks\n\n< 12 g/dl \ndespite 4 weeks \nat reduced dose\n\nIn case of intolerance to ribavirin, Pegasys monotherapy should be continued.\n\n\n\n43\n\nLiver function\nFluctuations in abnormalities of liver function tests are common in patients with CHC. Increases in \nALT levels above baseline (BL) have been observed in patients treated with Pegasys, including \npatients with a virological response.\nIn CHC clinical trials with adult patients, isolated increases in ALT (≥ 10x upper limit of normal \n[ULN], or ≥ 2x BL for patients with a BL ALT ≥ 10x ULN) which resolved without dose-modification \nwere observed in 8 of 451 patients treated with combination therapy. If ALT increase is progressive or \npersistent, the dose should be reduced initially to 135 micrograms. When increases in ALT levels are \nprogressive despite dose reduction, or are accompanied by increased bilirubin or evidence of hepatic \ndecompensation, therapy should be discontinued (see section 4.4).\n\nFor CHB patients, transient flares of ALT levels sometimes exceeding 10x ULN are not uncommon, \nand may reflect immune clearance. Treatment should normally not be initiated if ALT is >10x ULN . \nConsideration should be given to continuing treatment with more frequent monitoring of liver function \nduring ALT flares. If the Pegasys dose is reduced or withheld, therapy can be restored once the flare is \nsubsiding (see section 4.4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nAdjustments in the recommended dosage of 180 micrograms once weekly are not necessary when \ninstituting Pegasys therapy in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A reduced \ndose of 135 mcg once weekly is recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment or end \nstage renal disease (see section 5.2). Regardless of the starting dose or degree of renal impairment, \npatients should be monitored and appropriate dose reductions of Pegasys during the course of therapy \nshould be made in the event of adverse reactions.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with compensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh A), Pegasys has been shown to be effective \nand safe. Pegasys has not been evaluated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., Child-Pugh B \nor C or bleeding oesophageal varices) (see section 4.3).\n\nThe Child-Pugh classification divides patients into groups A, B, and C, or \"Mild\", \"Moderate\" and \n\"Severe\" corresponding to scores of 5-6, 7-9 and 10-15, respectively.\n\n\n\n44\n\nModified Assessment\n\nAssessment Degree of abnormality Score\nEncephalopathy None\n\nGrade 1-2\nGrade 3-4*\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nAscites Absent\nSlight\nModerate\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nS-Bilirubin (mg/dl)\n\nSI unit = mol/l)\n\n<2\n2.0-3 \n>3\n\n<34 \n34-51 \n>51\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nS-Albumin (g/dl) >3.5 \n3.5-2.8 \n<2.8\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\nINR <1.7 \n1.7-2.3\n>2.3\n\n1 \n2 \n3\n\n*Grading according to Trey, Burns and Saunders (1966)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nPegasys is contraindicated in neonates and young children up to 3 years old due to the excipient \nbenzyl alcohol (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nIt is recommended that Pegasys pre-filled syringes be used for paediatric patients. The Pegasys pre-\nfilled pens do not allow for appropriate adjustment of dosing in these patients. Patients who initiate \ntreatment prior to their 18th birthday should maintain paediatric dosing through the completion of \ntherapy. \n\nThe posology of Pegasys in paediatric patients is based on the Body Surface Area (BSA). To calculate \nBSA, it is recommended to use Mosteller’s equation:\n\nThe recommended duration of therapy is 48 weeks in patients with CHB.\nBefore initiating therapy for CHB, persistently elevated serum ALT levels should have been \ndocumented. The response rate was lower in patients with no to minimal increase in ALT level at \nbaseline (see Section 5.1). \n\nThe duration of treatment with Pegasys in combination with ribavirin in paediatric patients with CHC \ndepends on viral genotype.  Patients infected with viral genotypes 2 or 3 should receive 24 weeks of \ntreatment, while patients infected with any other genotype should receive 48 weeks of therapy. \nPatients who still have detectable levels of HCV-RNA despite an initial 24 weeks of therapy, should \ndiscontinue therapy, as it is unlikely they will be able to achieve a sustained virological response with \ncontinued therapy.\n\nFor children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years with CHB and having a BSA greater than 0.54 m2 and \nfor children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years with CHC and having a BSA greater than 0.71 m2, the \nrecommended doses for Pegasys are provided in Table 4.\n\n\n\n45\n\nTable 4: Pegasys dosing recommendations for paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B and \nchronic hepatitis C\n\nBody Surface Area (BSA) range (m2)\nWeekly dose (mcg)\n\nCHC CHB\n0.71-0.74 0.54-0.74 65\n\n0.75-1.08 90\n1.09-1.51 135\n\n>1.51 180\n\nFor paediatric patients, based on toxicities, up to three levels of dose modification can be made before \ndose interruption or discontinuation is considered (see Table 5).\n\nTable 5: Pegasys dose modification recommendations in paediatric patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C\n\nStarting dose\n(mcg)\n\n1 level reduction\n(mcg)\n\n2 level reduction\n(mcg)\n\n3 level reduction\n(mcg)\n\n65 45 30 20\n90 65 45 20\n\n135 90 65 30\n180 135 90 45\n\nRecommendations for dose modifications of Pegasys for toxicities in the CHB and CHC paediatric \npopulations are presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6: Pegasys dose modification recommendations for toxicities in paediatric patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C\n\nToxicity Pegasys Dose Modification\nNeutropenia 500 to < 750 cells/mm3: Immediate 1 level adjustment.\n\n250 to < 500 cells/mm3: interrupt dosing until ≥ 1000 cells/mm3, then \nresume dose with 2 level adjustments and monitor.\n\n< 250 cells/mm3 (or febrile neutropenia): discontinue treatment.\nThrombocytopenia Platelet 25,000 to <50,000 cells/mm3: 2 level adjustment.\n\nPlatelet <25,000 cells/mm3: discontinue treatment.\nIncreased alanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT)\n\nFor persistent or increasing elevations ≥5 but <10 x ULN, reduce dose \nwith a 1 level adjustment and monitor weekly ALT level to ensure it is \nstable or decreasing.\n\nFor persistent ALT values ≥10 x ULN discontinue treatment.\n\nDose adjustement in paediatric patients – dual therapy with Pegasys and ribavirin\n\nFor children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years with CHC, the recommended dose of ribavirin is \nbased on the patient’s body weight, with a target dose of 15 mg/kg/day, divided in two daily doses. \nFor children and adolescents 23 kg or greater, a dosing schedule using 200 mg ribavirin tablets is \nprovided in Table 7. Patients and caregivers must not attempt to break the 200 mg tablets.\n\n\n\n46\n\nTable 7: Ribavirin dosing recommendations for paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C \naged 5 to 17 years\n\nBody weight kg (lbs) Ribavirin daily dose\n(Approx. 15 mg/kg/day)\n\nRibavirin number of tablets\n\n23 – 33 (51-73) 400 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n1 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n34 – 46 (75-101) 600 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n47 – 59 (103-131) 800 mg/day 2 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n60 – 74 (132-163) 1000 mg/day 2 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n3 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n≥75 (>165) 1200 mg/day 3 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n3 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\nIt is important to note that ribavirin should never be given as monotherapy. Unless otherwise noted, \nthe management of all other toxicities should follow the adult recommendations.\n\nIn paediatric patients, ribavirin treatment-associated toxicities, such as treatment-emergent anaemia, \nwill be managed by reduction of the full dose. The dose reduction levels are provided in Table 8. \n\nTable 8: Ribavirin dose modification recommendations in paediatric patients with chronic \nhepatitis C\n\nFull dose\n(Approx. 15 mg/kg/day)\n\nOne step dose modification\n(Approx. 7.5 mg/kg/day)\n\nRibavirin number of tablets\n\n400 mg/day 200 mg/day 1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n\n600 mg/day 400 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n1 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n800 mg/day 400 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n1 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n1000 mg/day 600 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\n1200 mg/day 600 mg/day\n1 x 200 mg tablets A.M.\n2 x 200 mg tablets P.M.\n\nThere is limited experience with Pegasys in treating paediatric patients with CHC aged 3 to 5 years, or \nwho have failed to be adequately treated previously. There are no data in paediatric patients coinfected \nwith HCV/HIV or with renal impairment.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPegasys is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh. Exposure to Pegasys was decreased \nin studies following administration of Pegasys in the arm (see section 5.2).\n\nPegasys is designed for administration by the patient or carer. Each syringe should be used by one \nperson only and is for single use.\n\nAppropriate training is recommended for non-healthcare professionals administering this medicinal \nproduct. The “Instructions for the User”, provided in the carton, must be followed carefully by the \npatient.\n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to alfa interferons, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1\n\n Autoimmune hepatitis\n\n\n\n47\n\n Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver\n A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac \n\ndisease in the previous six months (see section 4.4)\n HIV-HCV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh score ≥ 6, except if only due to indirect \n\nhyperbilirubinemia caused by medicinal products such as atazanavir and indinavir\n Combination with telbivudine (see section 4.5) \n Neonates and young children up to 3 years old, because of the excipient benzyl alcohol (see \n\nsection 4.4 for benzyl alcohol)\n In paediatric patients, the presence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly \n\nsevere depression, suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, \nsuicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Pegasys therapy, \nand even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Other CNS \neffects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal \nideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed \nwith alfa interferons. All patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of \npsychiatric disorders. If symptoms of psychiatric disorders appear, the potential seriousness of these \nundesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with Pegasys be discontinued, and the patient \nfollowed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: If treatment with Pegasys is \njudged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should \nonly be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic \nmanagement of the psychiatric condition.\nThe use of Pegasys in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric \nconditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse: HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use \ndisorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or \nexacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alfa interferon. If treatment \nwith alfa interferon is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities \nand the potential for other substance use should be carefully assessed and adequately managed before \ninitiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider \nor addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should \nbe closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment discontinuation. Early intervention for \nre-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.\n\n\n\n48\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents):\n\nDuring therapy with Pegasys +/- ribavirin lasting up to 48 weeks in patients aged 3 to 17 years, \nweight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n\nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed \nfor children and adolescents in the clinical trials on a case by case basis (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). It \nis important to consider the treatment with Pegasys +/- ribavirin induced a growth inhibition during \ntreatment, the reversibility of which is uncertain.\n\nThe risk of growth inhibition should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such \nas evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the \ndisease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (for HBV-\ninfection mainly HBV genotype and ALT levels; for HCV-infection mainly HCV genotype and \nHCV-RNA levels) (see section 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long-term effects on sexual maturation.\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file.\n\nLaboratory tests prior to and during therapy\nPrior to beginning Pegasys therapy, standard haematological and biochemical laboratory tests are \nrecommended for all patients.\n\nThe following may be considered as baseline values for initiation of treatment:\n- Platelet count  90,000 cells/mm3\n\n- ANC  1500 cells/mm3\n\n- Adequately controlled thyroid function (TSH and T4)\n\nHaematological tests should be repeated after 2 and 4 weeks and biochemical tests should be \nperformed at 4 weeks. Additional testing should be performed periodically during therapy (including \nglucose monitoring).\n\nIn clinical trials, Pegasys treatment was associated with decreases in both total white blood cell \n(WBC) count and ANC, usually starting within the first 2 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). \nProgressive decreases after 8 weeks of therapy were infrequent. The decrease in ANC was reversible \nupon dose reduction or cessation of therapy (see section 4.2), reached normal values by 8 weeks in the \nmajority of patients and returned to baseline in all patients after about 16 weeks.\n\nPegasys treatment has been associated with decreases in platelet count, which returned to pre-\ntreatment levels during the post-treatment observation period (see section 4.8). In some cases, dose \nmodification may be necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nThe occurrence of anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g/dl) has been observed in up to 15% of CHC patients \nin clinical trials on the combined treatment of Pegasys with ribavirin. The frequency depends on the \ntreatment duration and the dose of ribavirin (see section 4.8). The risk of developing anaemia is higher \nin the female population.\n\nCaution should be exercised when administering Pegasys in combination with other potentially \nmyelosuppressive agents.\n\nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 \nweeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This \nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \n\n\n\n49\n\nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon re-introduction of either treatment alone (see section \n4.5).\n\nThe use of Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy in CHC patients who failed prior treatment has \nnot been adequately studied in patients who discontinued prior therapy for haematological adverse \nreactions. Physicians considering treatment in these patients should carefully weigh the risks versus \nthe benefits of re-treatment.\n\nEndocrine system\nThyroid function abnormalities or worsening of pre-existing thyroid disorders have been reported with \nthe use of alfa interferons, including Pegasys. Prior to initiation of Pegasys therapy, TSH and T4 levels \nshould be evaluated. Pegasys treatment may be initiated or continued if TSH levels can be maintained \nin the normal range by pharmaceutical means. TSH levels should be determined during the course of \ntherapy if a patient develops clinical symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction (see \nsection 4.8). Hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus have been observed with Pegasys \n(see section 4.8). Patients with these conditions who cannot be effectively controlled by medication \nshould not begin Pegasys monotherapy or Pegasys/ribavirin combination therapy. Patients who \ndevelop these conditions during treatment and cannot be controlled with medication should \ndiscontinue Pegasys or Pegasys/ribavirin therapy.\n\nCardiovascular system\nHypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, chest pain and myocardial \ninfarction have been associated with alfa interferon therapies, including Pegasys. It is recommended \nthat patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have an electrocardiogram prior to initiation \nof Pegasys therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, therapy should be suspended \nor discontinued. In patients with cardiovascular disease, anaemia may necessitate dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation of ribavirin (see section 4.2).\n\nLiver function\nIn patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation during treatment, Pegasys should be \ndiscontinued. Increases in ALT levels above baseline have been observed in patients treated with \nPegasys, including patients with a viral response. When the increase in ALT levels is progressive and \nclinically significant, despite dose reduction, or is accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, therapy \nshould be discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nIn CHB, unlike CHC, disease exacerbations during therapy are not uncommon and are characterised \nby transient and potentially significant increases in serum ALT. In clinical trials with Pegasys in HBV, \nmarked transaminase flares have been accompanied by mild changes in other measures of hepatic \nfunction and without evidence of hepatic decompensation. In approximately half the cases of flares \nexceeding 10x ULN, Pegasys dosing was reduced or withheld until the transaminase elevations \nsubsided, while in the rest therapy was continued unchanged. More frequent monitoring of hepatic \nfunction was recommended in all instances.\n\nHypersensitivity\nSerious, acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, \nanaphylaxis) have been rarely observed during alfa interferon therapy. If this occurs, therapy must be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical therapy instituted immediately. Transient rashes do not \nnecessitate interruption of treatment.\n\nAutoimmune disease\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alfa interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be re-assessed (see also \nEndocrine system in sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n\n\n50\n\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with CHC treated \nwith interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory \nsystem, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn \nand corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nFever/infections \nWhile fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent fever, particularly serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) must \nbe ruled out, especially in patients with neutropenia. Serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) and \nsepsis have been reported during treatment with alfa interferons including Pegasys. Appropriate anti-\ninfective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered.\n\nOcular changes\nRetinopathy including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, optic neuropathy and \nretinal artery or vein obstruction which may result in loss of vision have been reported in rare \ninstances with Pegasys. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of \ndecrease or loss of vision must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Adult and paediatric \npatients with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should \nreceive periodic ophthalmologic exams during Pegasys therapy. Pegasys treatment should be \ndiscontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.\n\nPulmonary changes\nPulmonary symptoms, including dyspnoea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, and pneumonitis have \nbeen reported during therapy with Pegasys. In case of persistent or unexplained pulmonary infiltrates \nor pulmonary function impairment, treatment should be discontinued.\n\nSkin disorder\nUse of alfa interferons has been associated with exacerbation or provocation of psoriasis and \nsarcoidosis. Pegasys must be used with caution in patients with psoriasis, and in cases of onset or \nworsening of psoriatic lesions, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.\n\nTransplantation\nThe safety and efficacy of Pegasys and ribavirin treatment have not been established in patients with \nliver and other transplantations. Liver and renal graft rejections have been reported with Pegasys, \nalone or in combination with ribavirin.\n\nHIV-HCV co-infection\nPlease refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of \ntoxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with Pegasys with or \nwithout ribavirin. In study NR15961, patients concurrently treated with stavudine and interferon \ntherapy with or without ribavirin, the incidence of pancreatitis and/or lactic acidosis was 3% (12/398).\n\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be \nat increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should therefore be exercised when adding \nPegasys and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SmPC).\n\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may also be at increased risk of \nhepatic decompensation and possibly death if treated with ribavirin in combination with interferons, \nincluding Pegasys. Baseline variables in co-infected cirrhotic patients that may be associated with \nhepatic decompensation include: increased serum bilirubin, decreased haemoglobin, increased alkaline \nphosphatase or decreased platelet count, and treatment with didanosine (ddI).\n\nThe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of \nanaemia (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n51\n\nDuring treatment, co-infected patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic \ndecompensation (including ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, impaired hepatic synthetic \nfunction; e.g., Child-Pugh score of 7 or greater). The Child-Pugh scoring may be affected by factors \nrelated to treatment (i.e. indirect hyperbilirubinemia, decreased albumin) and not necessarily \nattributable to hepatic decompensation. Treatment with Pegasys should be discontinued immediately \nin patients with hepatic decompensation.\n\nIn patients co-infected with HIV-HCV, limited efficacy and safety data are available in patients with \nCD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low \nCD4 counts.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof Pegasys and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nUse of peginterferon as long term maintenance monotherapy (unapproved use)\nIn a randomised, controlled US study (HALT-C) of HCV non-responder patients with varied degrees \nof fibrosis where 3.5 years of treatment with 90 micrograms/week of Pegasys monotherapy was \nstudied, no significant reductions were observed in the rate of fibrosis progression or related clinical \nevents.\n\nExcipient\nPegasys contains benzyl alcohol. Must not be given to premature babies or neonates. May cause toxic \nreactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nAdministration of Pegasys 180 micrograms once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy male subjects did not \nshow any effect on mephenytoin, dapsone, debrisoquine and tolbutamide pharmacokinetics profiles, \nsuggesting that Pegasys has no effect on in vivo metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C9, \n2C19 and 2D6 isozymes.\n\nIn the same study, a 25% increase in the AUC of theophylline (marker of cytochrome P450 1A2 \nactivity) was observed, demonstrating that Pegasys is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2 activity. \nSerum concentrations of theophylline should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments of \ntheophylline made for patients taking theophylline and Pegasys concomitantly. The interaction \nbetween theophylline and Pegasys is likely to be maximal after more than 4 weeks of Pegasys therapy.\n\nHCV monoinfected patients and HBV monoinfected patients\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of 24 HCV patients concomitantly receiving methadone maintenance \ntherapy (median dose 95 mg; range 30 mg to 150 mg), treatment with Pegasys 180 micrograms sc\nonce weekly for 4 weeks was associated with mean methadone levels that were 10% to 15% higher \nthan at baseline. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; nonetheless, patients should be \nmonitored for the signs and symptoms of methadone toxicity. Especially in patients on a high dose of \nmethadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.\n\nRibavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere \nwith azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine \nmonophosphate (6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with \nazathioprine. The use of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprin should be \n\n\n\n52\n\navoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with \nazathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close haematologic monitoring be \ndone during concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment \nwith these medicinal products should be stopped (see section 4.4).\n\nResults from pharmacokinetic substudies of pivotal phase III trials demonstrated no pharmacokinetic \ninteraction of lamivudine on Pegasys in HBV patients or between Pegasys and ribavirin in HCV \npatients.\n\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration for the treatment of HBV, \nindicates that the combination is associated with an increased risk for developing peripheral \nneuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known; thus, co-treatment with telbivudine and\nother interferons (pegylated or standard) may also entail an excess risk. Moreover, the benefit of the \ncombination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established.\nTherefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nHIV-HCV co-infected patients\nNo apparent evidence of drug interaction was observed in 47 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who \ncompleted a 12-week pharmacokinetic substudy to examine the effect of ribavirin on the intracellular \nphosphorylation of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine or \nstavudine). However, due to high variability, the confidence intervals were quite wide. Plasma \nexposure of ribavirin did not appear to be affected by concomitant administration of nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).\n\nCo-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. Exposure to didanosine or its \nactive metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate) is increased in vitro when didanosine is co-\nadministered with ribavirin. Reports of fatal hepatic failure as well as peripheral neuropathy, \npancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactataemia/lactic acidosis have been reported with use of ribavirin.\n\nExacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral therapy \nregimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known \nhistory of zidovudine induced anaemia.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of peginterferon alfa-2a in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals with interferon alfa-2a have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) and the \npotential risk for humans is unknown. Pegasys is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nIt is unknown whether peginterferon alfa-2a/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the \npotential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to \ninitiation of treatment.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on the effects of peginterferon alfa-2a on fertility in women. A prolongation of the \nmenstrual cycle has been seen with peginterferon alfa-2a in female monkeys (see section 5.3).\n\n\n\n53\n\nUse with ribavirin\nSignificant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species \nexposed to ribavirin. Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Extreme care \nmust be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking Pegasys in \ncombination with ribavirin. Female patients of childbearing potential must use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or \ntheir female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after \ntreatment has been concluded. Please refer to the ribavirin SmPC.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPegasys has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who \ndevelop dizziness, confusion, somnolence or fatigue should be cautioned to avoid driving or operating \nmachinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nChronic hepatitis B in adult patients\n\nIn clinical trials of 48 weeks treatment and 24 weeks follow-up, the safety profile for Pegasys in CHB\nwas similar to that seen in CHC. With the exception of pyrexia the frequency of the majority of the \nreported adverse reactions was notably less in CHB patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy \ncompared with CHC patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy (see Table 9). Adverse events were\nexperienced by 88% of Pegasys-treated patients as compared with 53% of patients in the lamivudine \ncomparator group, while 6% of the Pegasys-treated and 4% of the lamivudine-treated patients \nexperienced serious adverse events during the studies. Adverse events or laboratory abnormalities led \nto 5% of patients withdrawing from Pegasys treatment, while less than 1% of patients withdrew from \nlamivudine treatment for these reasons. The percentage of patients with cirrhosis who withdrew from \ntreatment was similar to that of the overall population in each treatment group.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in adult patients\n\nThe frequency and severity of the most commonly reported adverse reactions with Pegasys are similar \nto those reported with interferon alfa-2a (see Table 9). The most frequently reported adverse reactions \nwith Pegasys 180 micrograms were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without \nthe need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.\n\nChronic hepatitis C in prior non-responder patients\n\nOverall, the safety profile for Pegasys in combination with ribavirin in prior non-responder patients \nwas similar to that in naïve patients. In a clinical trial of non-responder patients to prior pegylated \ninterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin, which exposed patients to either 48 or 72 weeks of treatment, the \nfrequency of withdrawal for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities from Pegasys treatment and \nribavirin treatment was 6% and 7%, respectively, in the 48 week arms and 12% and 13% ,respectively, \nin the 72 week arms. Similarly for patients with cirrhosis or transition to cirrhosis, the frequencies of \nwithdrawal from Pegasys treatment and ribavirin treatment were higher in the 72-week treatment arms \n(13% and 15%) than in the 48-week arms (6% and 6%). Patients who withdrew from previous therapy \nwith pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin because of haematological toxicity were excluded from \nenrolling in this trial.\n\nIn another clinical trial, non-responder patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak score of 3 to \n6) and baseline platelet counts as low as 50,000 cells/mm3 were treated for 48 weeks. Haematologic \nlaboratory abnormalities observed during the first 20 weeks of the trial included anaemia (26% of \npatients experienced a haemoglobin level of <10 g/dl), neutropenia (30% experienced an ANC \n\n\n\n54\n\n<750 cells/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (13% experienced a platelet count <50,000 cells/mm3) (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nChronic hepatitis C and HIV co-infection\n\nIn HIV-HCV co-infected patients, the clinical adverse reaction profiles reported for Pegasys, alone or \nin combination with ribavirin, were similar to those observed in HCV mono-infected patients. For \nHIV-HCV patients receiving Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy other undesirable effects have \nbeen reported in ≥ 1% to ≤ 2% of patients: hyperlactacidaemia/lactic acidosis, influenza, pneumonia, \naffect lability, apathy, tinnitus, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cheilitis, acquired lipodystrophy and \nchromaturia. Pegasys treatment was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the \nfirst 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was \nreversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of Pegasys had no observable negative \nimpact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data are available \nin co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts <200/µl.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 9 summarises the undesirable effects reported with Pegasys monotherapy in CHB or CHC adult \npatients and with Pegasys in combination with ribavirin in CHC patients. Undesirable effects reported \nin clinical studies are grouped according to frequency as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000). For spontaneous reports of undesirable effects from post-marketing experience, the \nfrequency is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of seriousness.\n\nTable 9: Undesirable effects reported with Pegasys monotherapy for CHB or CHC or in

Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nLaboratory values\nPegasys treatment was associated with abnormal laboratory values: ALT increase, bilirubin increase, \nelectrolyte disturbance (hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia), hyperglycaemia, \nhypoglycaemia and elevated triglycerides (see section 4.4.). With both Pegasys monotherapy, and also \nthe combined treatment with ribavirin, up to 2% of patients experienced increased ALT levels that led \nto dose modification or discontinuation of the treatment.\n\nTreatment with Pegasys was associated with decreases in haematological values (leucopenia, \nneutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and haemoglobin), which generally improved with dose \nmodification, and returned to pre-treatment levels within 4-8 weeks upon cessation of therapy (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nModerate (ANC: 0.749 - 0.5 x 109/l) and severe (ANC: < 0.5 x 109/l) neutropenia was observed \nrespectively in 24% (216/887) and 5% (41/887) of patients receiving Pegasys 180 micrograms and \nribavirin 1000/1200 milligrams for 48 weeks.\n\nAnti-interferon antibodies\n1-5% of patients treated with Pegasys developed neutralising anti-interferon antibodies. As with other \ninterferons, a higher incidence of neutralising antibodies was seen in CHB. However in neither disease \nwas this correlated with lack of therapeutic response.\n\nThyroid function\nPegasys treatment was associated with clinically significant abnormalities in thyroid laboratory values \nrequiring clinical intervention (see section 4.4). The frequencies observed (4.9%) in patients receiving \nPegasys/ribavirin (NV15801) are similar to those observed with other interferons.\n\nLaboratory values for HIV-HCV co-infected patients\nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HIV-HCV patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and the use of \ngrowth factors and infrequently required premature discontinuation of treatment. Decrease in ANC \nlevels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 13% and 11% of patients receiving Pegasys monotherapy \nand combination therapy, respectively. Decrease in platelets below 50,000 cells/mm3 was observed in \n10% and 8% of patients receiving Pegasys monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. \nAnaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dl) was reported in 7% and 14% of patients treated with Pegasys \nmonotherapy or in combination therapy, respectively.\n\n\n\n58\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChronic hepatitis B \n\nIn a clinical trial (YV25718) with 111 paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with Pegasys \nfor 48 weeks, the safety profile was consistent with that seen in adults with CHB and in paediatric \npatients with CHC. \n\nThe mean changes from baseline in height and weight for age Z-scores at Week 48 of treatment in \nstudy YV25718 were -0.07 and -0.21(n=108 and n= 106 respectively) for Pegasys-treated patients as \ncompared to - 0.01 and -0.08 (n=47 each) in untreated patients. At Week 48 of Pegasys treatment, a \nheight or weight percentile decrease of more than 15 percentiles on the normative growth curves was \nobserved in 6% of patients for height and 11% of patient for weight, whereas in the untreated group it \nwas 2% of patients for height and 9% for weight. No data is available on long-term follow-up post-\ntreatment in these patients (see section 4.4).\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nIn a clinical trial with 114 paediatric patients (5 to 17 years of age) treated with Pegasys alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin (see section 5.1), dose modifications were required in approximately one-\nthird of patients, most commonly for neutropenia and anaemia. In general, the safety profile observed \nin paediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults. In the paediatric study, the most prevalent \nadverse reactions in patients treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with Pegasys and \nribavirin were influenza-like illness (91%), headache (64%), gastrointestinal disorder (56%), and \ninjection-site reaction (45%). A full listing of adverse reactions reported in this treatment group (n=55) \nis provided in Table 10. Seven patients receiving combination Pegasys and ribavirin treatment for 48 \nweeks discontinued therapy for safety reasons (depression, psychiatric evaluation abnormal, transient \nblindness, retinal exudates, hyperglycaemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and anaemia). Most of the \nadverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse reactions \nwere reported in 2 patients in the Pegasys plus ribavirin combination therapy group (hyperglycaemia \nand cholecystectomy).\n\nGrowth inhibition was observed in paediatric patients (see section 4.4). Paediatric patients treated with \nPegasys plus ribavirin combination therapy showed a delay in weight and height increases after 48 \nweeks of therapy compared with baseline. Patient ‘weight for age’ and ‘height for age’ percentiles of \nthe normative population decreased during treatment. At the end of 2 years follow-up after treatment, \nmost patients had returned to baseline normative growth curve percentiles for weight and height (mean \nweight percentile was 64% at baseline and 60% at 2 years post-treatment; mean height percentile was \n54% at baseline and 56% at 2 years post-treatment). At the end of treatment, 43% of patients \nexperienced a weight percentile decrease of 15 percentiles or more, and 25% (13 of 53) experienced a \nheight percentile decrease of 15 percentiles or more on the normative growth curves. At 2 years post-\ntreatment, 16% (6 of 38) of patients remained 15 percentiles or more below their baseline weight \ncurve and 11% (4 of 38) remained 15 percentiles or more below their baseline height curve.\n\n55% (21 of 38) of subjects who completed the original study enrolled in the long-term follow up \nextending up to 6 years post-treatment. The study demonstrated that the post-treatment recovery in \ngrowth at 2 years post-treatment was maintained to 6 years post-treatment. For a few subjects who \nwere more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve at 2 years post-treatment, they either \nreturned to baseline comparable height percentiles at 6 years post-treatment or a non-treatment related \ncausative factor has been identified. The extent of available data is not sufficient to conclude that \ngrowth inhibition due to Pegasys exposure is always reversible.\n\n\n\n59\n\nTable 10: Adverse reactions reported among paediatric patients infected with HCV and assigned \nto Pegasys plus ribavirin in study NV17424\n\nLaboratory values\nDecreases in haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets or increased ALT may require dose reduction or \npermanent discontinuation from treatment (see section 4.2). Most laboratory abnormalities noted \nduring the clinical trial returned to baseline levels shortly after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Weekly doses of up to 540 and \n630 micrograms have been administered in renal cell carcinoma and chronic myelogenous leukaemia \nclinical trials, respectively. Dose limiting toxicities were fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia \nand thrombocytopenia, consistent with interferon therapy.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, interferons, ATC code: L03AB11\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe conjugation of PEG reagent (bis-monomethoxypolyethylene glycol) to interferon alfa-2a forms a \npegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys). Pegasys possesses the in vitro antiviral and antiproliferative \nactivities that are characteristic of interferon alfa-2a.\n\nInterferon alfa-2a is conjugated with bis-[monomethoxy polyethylene glycol] at a degree of \nsubstitution of one mole of polymer/mole of protein. The average molecular mass is approximately \n60,000 of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 20,000.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nHCV RNA levels decline in a biphasic manner in responding patients with hepatitis C who have \nreceived treatment with 180 micrograms Pegasys. The first phase of decline occurs 24 to 36 hours \nafter the first dose of Pegasys and is followed by the second phase of decline which continues over the \nnext 4 to 16 weeks in patients who achieve a sustained response. Ribavirin had no significant effect on \nthe initial viral kinetics over the first 4 to 6 weeks in patients treated with the combination of ribavirin \nand pegylated interferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nChronic hepatitis B\n\nPredictability of response\n\nA patient-level meta-analysis of 9 Pegasys clinical studies (n=1,423) in CHB HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg-negative patients demonstrated that HBsAg and HBV DNA levels at Week 12 of treatment, \nare predictive of final treatment outcome at Week 24 post-treatment in certain genotypes. Operating \ncharacteristics of these biomarkers are presented in Table 11. No single biomarker with a cut-off can \nbe identified to optimize all the operating characteristics (negative predictive value [NPV], sensitivity, \nspecificity) and practical characteristics (simplicity, convenience). Consideration for early treatment \ndiscontinuation should be evaluated in the context of a particular clinical situation.\n\nFor HBeAg-positive patients with HBV genotype B and C infection, HBsAg > 20,000 IU/mL or HBV \nDNA > 8 log10 IU/mL at Week 12 following commencement of treatment is associated with high \nlikelihood of failure to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA <2,000 IU/mL at 24 week \npost-treatment (NPV > 90%). For HBV genotype A and D, subgroup size was insufficient to be \nanalyzed. \n\nFor HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype D infection, HBsAg > 20,000 IU/mL or HBV DNA \n> 6.5 log10 IU/mL at Week 12 following commencement of treatment is associated with high \nlikelihood of failure to achieve HBV-DNA <2,000 IU/mL and ALT normalization at Week 24 post \ntreatment. HBV genotype A subgroup size was insufficient to be analyzed. No biomarker can be \nidentified with acceptable performance for HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype B or C \ninfection. \n\n\n\n61\n\nOther published on-treatment biomarkers that are predictive of the final outcome of Pegasys treatment \nmay be considered.\n\nTable 11: Performance of individual biomarkers at Week 12 of therapy in CHB HBeAg-positive \nand HBeAg-negative patients according to genotype\n\nGenotype Cut-off (IU/mL) NPV Sensitivity Specificity\n\nHBeAg-positive(a)\n\nB\nHBsAg > 20,000 0.93 0.96 0.23\n\nHBV DNA > 8 log10 0.90 0.94 0.26\n\nC\nHBsAg > 20,000 0.96 0.97 0.22\n\nHBV DNA > 8 log10 0.98 0.98 0.19\n\nHBeAg-negative(a)\n\nD\nHBsAg > 20,000 0.91 0.94 0.16\n\nHBV DNA > 6.5 log10 1.00 1.00 0.11\nNPV= negative predictive value; Sensitivity = % of all responders not meeting the stopping rule; Specificity = % of \nall non-responders meeting stopping rule\n(a) Treatment response for HBeAg-positive patients was defined as HBeAg seroconversion (defined as loss of \nHBeAg and presence of anti-HBe) + HBV DNA <2,000 IU/mL at 6 months post-treatment and treatment response \nfor HBeAg-negative patients was defined as HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL + ALT normalization at 6 months post-\ntreatment.\n\nAll clinical trials recruited patients with CHB who had active viral replication measured by HBV \nDNA, elevated levels of ALT and a liver biopsy consistent with chronic hepatitis. Study WV16240 \nrecruited patients who were positive for HBeAg, while study WV16241 recruited patients who were \nnegative for HBeAg and positive for anti-HBe. In both studies the treatment duration was 48 weeks, \nwith 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Both studies compared Pegasys plus placebo vs Pegasys \nplus lamivudine vs lamivudine alone. No HBV-HIV co-infected patients were included in these \nclinical trials.\n\nResponse rates at the end of follow-up for the two studies are presented in Table 12. In study \nWV16240, the primary efficacy endpoints were HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA below 105\n\ncopies/ml. In study WV16241, the primary efficacy endpoints were ALT normalisation and HBV-\nDNA below 2 x 104 copies/ml. HBV-DNA was measured by the COBAS AMPLICOR HBV \nMONITOR Assay (limit of detection 200 copies/ml).\n\nA total of 283/1351 (21%) of patients had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, 85/1351 (6%) had cirrhosis. \nThere was no difference in response rate between these patients and those without advanced fibrosis or \ncirrhosis.\n\n\n\n62\n\nTable 12: Serological, virological and biochemical responses in chronic hepatitis B\nHBeAg positive\nStudy WV16240\n\nHBeAg negative / anti-HBe positive\nStudy WV16241\n\nResponse \nParameter\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n&\nPlacebo\n\n(N=271)\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n&\nLamivudine\n\n100 mg\n(N=271)\n\nLamivudine\n100 mg\n\n(N=272)\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n&\nPlacebo\n\n(N=177)\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n&\nLamivudine\n\n100 mg\n(N=179)\n\nLamivudine\n100 mg\n\n(N=181)\nHBeAg Sero-\nconversion\n\n32% # 27% 19% N/A N/A N/A\n\nHBV DNA \nresponse *\n\n32% # 34% 22% 43% # 44% 29%\n\nALT Normal-\nisation\n\n41% # 39% 28% 59% # 60% 44%\n\nHBsAg Sero-\nconversion\n\n3% # 3% 0% 3% 2% 0%\n\n* For HBeAg-positive patients: HBV DNA < 105 copies/ml\nFor HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive patients: HBV DNA < 2 x 104 copies/ml\n\n# p-value (vs. lamivudine) < 0.01 (stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test)\n\nHistological response was similar across the three treatment groups in each study; however, patients \nshowing a sustained response 24 weeks after the end of treatment were significantly more likely to \nalso show histological improvement.\n\nAll patients who completed the phase III studies were eligible for entry into a long-term follow-up \nstudy (WV16866). Among patients from study WV16240, who received Pegasys monotherapy and \nentered the long-term follow-up study, the rate of sustained HBeAg seroconversion 12 months after \nthe end of therapy was 48% (73/153). In patients receiving Pegasys monotherapy in study WV16241, \nthe rate of HBV DNA response and ALT normalisation 12 months after end of treatment were 42% \n(41/97) and 59% (58/99), respectively.\n\nChronic hepatitis C\n\nPredictability of response\nPlease refer to section 4.2, in Table 2.\n\nDose-response in monotherapy\nIn a direct comparison with 90 micrograms, the 180 micrograms-dose was associated with superior \nsustained virological response in patients with cirrhosis, but in a study in non-cirrhotic patients very \nsimilar results were obtained with doses of 135 micrograms and 180 micrograms.\n\nConfirmatory clinical trials in adult treatment-naïve patients\nAll clinical trials recruited interferon-naïve patients with CHC confirmed by detectable levels of serum \nHCV RNA, elevated levels of ALT (with the exception of study NR16071) and a liver biopsy \nconsistent with chronic hepatitis. Study NV15495 specifically recruited patients with a histological \ndiagnosis of cirrhosis (about 80%) or transition to cirrhosis (about 20%). Only HIV-HCV co-infected \npatients were included in the study NR15961 (see Table 21). These patients had stable HIV disease \nand mean CD4 T-cell count was about 500 cells/µl. \nFor HCV monoinfected patients and HIV-HCV co-infected patients, for treatment regimens, duration \nof therapy and study outcome see Tables 13, 14, 15 and Table 21, respectively. Virological response \nwas defined as undetectable HCV RNA as measured by the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV Test, \nversion 2.0 (limit of detection 100 copies/ml equivalent to 50 International Units/ml) and sustained \nresponse as one negative sample approximately 6 months after end of therapy.\n\n\n\n63\n\nTable 13: Virological response in CHC patients\nPegasys monotherapy Pegasys combination therapy\n\nnon-cirrhotic and \ncirrhotic\n\ncirrhotic non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic\n\nStudy NV15496 + \nNV15497 + NV15801\n\nStudy NV15495 Study \nNV15942\n\nStudy NV15801\n\nPegasys\n\n180 mcg\n\n(N=701)\n48 weeks\n\nInterferon\nalfa-2a\n\n6 MIU/3 MIU\n&\n\n3 MIU\n\n(N=478)\n48 weeks\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n(N=87)\n48 weeks\n\nInterferon \nalfa-2a\n3 MIU\n\n(N=88)\n48 weeks\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n&\nRibavirin\n1000/1200\n\nmg\n\n(N=436)\n48 weeks\n\nPegasys\n180 mcg\n\n&\nRibavirin\n1000/1200\n\nmg\n\n(N=453)\n48 weeks\n\nInterferon\nalfa-2b\n3 MIU\n\n&\nRibavirin\n1000/1200\n\nmg\n\n(N=444)\n48 weeks\n\nResponse \nat End of \nTreatment \n\n55 - 69% 22 - 28% 44% 14% 68% 69% 52%\n\nOverall \nSustained \nResponse\n\n28 - 39% 11 - 19% 30%* 8%* 63% 54%** 45%**\n\n* 95% CI for difference: 11% to 33% p-value (stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) = 0.001\n** 95% CI for difference: 3% to 16% p-value (stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) = 0.003\n\nThe virological responses of HCV monoinfected patients treated with Pegasys and ribavirin \ncombination therapy in relation to genotype and pre-treatment viral load and in relation to genotype, \npre-treatment viral load and rapid virological response at week 4 are summarised in Table 14 and \nTable 15, respectively.

Preliminary and limited safety data demonstrated no obvious departure from the \nknown safety profile of the combination in adults with chronic HCV infection, but, importantly, the \npotential impact on growth has not been reported. Efficacy results were similar to those reported in \nadults.\n\nIn the NV17424 (PEDS-C) study, previously untreated paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age (55% \n<12 years old) with compensated CHC and detectable HCV RNA were treated with Pegasys 180 mcg \nx BSA/1.73 m2 once weekly for 48 weeks with or without ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day.

A total of 55 patients received initial combination treatment of \nPegasys plus ribavirin, of whom 51% were female, 82% were Caucasian, and 82% were infected with \nHCV genotype 1. The study efficacy results for these patients are summarised in Table 25.\n\nTable 25: Sustained virological response in the NV17424 study\n\nPegasys\n\n180 mcg x BSA/1.73 m² + \n\nRibavirin 15 mg/kg (N=55)*\n\nAll HCV genotypes** 29 (53%)\n\nHCV genotype 1 21/45 (47%)\n\nHCV genotype 2 and 3 8/10 (80%)\n\n*Results indicate undetectable HCV-RNA defined as HCV RNA less than 50 IU/ml at 24 weeks post-treatment using the \nAMPLICOR HCV test v2.\n**Scheduled treatment duration was 48 weeks regardless of the genotype\n\n\n\n71\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing a single subcutaneous injection of Pegasys 180 micrograms in healthy subjects, serum \nconcentrations of peginterferon alfa-2a are measurable within 3 to 6 hours. Within 24 hours, about \n80% of the peak serum concentration is reached. The absorption of Pegasys is sustained with peak \nserum concentrations reached 72 to 96 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of Pegasys is \n84% and is similar to that seen with interferon alfa-2a.\n\nDistribution\nPeginterferon alfa-2a is found predominantly in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid as seen by the \nvolume of distribution at steady-state (Vd) of 6 to 14 litres in humans after intravenous administration. \nFrom mass balance, tissue distribution and whole body autoradioluminography studies performed in \nrats, peginterferon alfa-2a is distributed to the liver, kidney and bone marrow in addition to being \nhighly concentrated in the blood.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe metabolism of Pegasys is not fully characterised; however studies in rats indicate that the kidney \nis a major organ for excretion of radiolabelled material. \n\nElimination\nIn humans, the systemic clearance of peginterferon alfa-2a is about 100-fold lower than that of the \nnative interferon alfa-2a. After intravenous administration, the terminal half-life of peginterferon alfa-\n2a in healthy subjects is approximately 60 to 80 hours compared to values of 3-4 hours for standard \ninterferon. The terminal half-life after subcutaneous administration in patients is longer with a mean \nvalue of 160 hours (84 to 353 hours). The terminal half-life may not only reflect the elimination phase \nof the compound, but may also reflect the sustained absorption of Pegasys.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nDose-proportional increases in exposure of Pegasys are seen in healthy subjects and in patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or C after once-weekly dosing.\n\nIn CHB or CHC patients, peginterferon alfa-2a serum concentrations accumulate 2 to 3 fold after 6 to \n8 weeks of once weekly dosing compared to single dose values. There is no further accumulation after \n8 weeks of once weekly dosing. The peak to trough ratio after 48 weeks of treatment is about 1.5 to 2. \nPeginterferon alfa-2a serum concentrations are sustained throughout one full week (168 hours).\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nA clinical trial evaluated 50 CHC patients with either moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) \nor severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment, or with end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) requiring chronic hemodialysis (HD). Patients with moderate renal impairment receiving \nPegasys 180 mcg once weekly exhibited similar peginterferon alfa-2a plasma exposures compared to \npatients with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment receiving Pegasys 180 mcg \nonce weekly showed a 60% higher peginterferon alfa-2a exposure than patients with normal renal \nfunction, therefore a reduced dose of Pegasys 135 mcg once weekly is recommended in patients with \nsevere renal impairment. In 13 patients with ESRD requiring chronic HD, administration of Pegasys \n135 mcg once weekly resulted in 34% lower peginterferon alfa-2a exposure than in patients with \nnormal renal function. However, several independent studies have demonstrated the 135mcg dose to \nbe safe, efficacious and well tolerated, in patients with ESRD (see section 4.2).\n\nGender\nThe pharmacokinetics of Pegasys after single subcutaneous injections was comparable between male \nand female healthy subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\nPegasys pharmacokinetics have been characterized in paediatric patients with CHB (YV25718), as \nwell as in paediatric patients with CHC (NR16141), using population pharmacokinetics.  In both \n\n\n\n72\n\nstudies, Pegasys apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution were related linearly to body \nsize ie. either BSA (NR16141) or body weight (YV25718).\n\nFrom the YV25718 study, 31 paediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age with CHB participated in the PK \nsub-study and received Pegasys according to a BSA category dosing regimen. Based on the population \npharmacokinetic model, the mean exposure (AUC) during the dosing interval for each BSA category \nwas comparable with that observed in adults receiving 180 mcg fixed dosing. \n\nFrom the NR16141study, 14 children 2 to 8 years of age with CHC received Pegasys monotherapy at a \ndose of: 180 mcg x BSA of the child/1.73 m2. The PK model developed from this study shows a linear \ninfluence of BSA on the apparent clearance of the drug over the age range studied. Thus, the lower the \nBSA of the child, the lower the clearance of the drug and the higher the resultant exposure. The mean \nexposure (AUC) during the dosing interval is predicted to be 25% to 70% higher than that observed in \nadults receiving 180 mcg fixed dosing.\n\nElderly\nIn subjects older than 62 years, the absorption of Pegasys after a single subcutaneous injection of \n180 micrograms was delayed but still sustained compared to young healthy subjects (tmax of 115 hours \nvs. 82 hours, older than 62 years vs. younger, respectively). The AUC was slightly increased (1663 vs. \n1295 ng·h/ml) but peak concentrations (9.1 vs. 10.3 ng/ml) were similar in subjects older than 62 \nyears. Based on drug exposure, pharmacodynamic response and tolerability, a lower dose of Pegasys is \nnot needed in the geriatric patient (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of Pegasys were similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatitis B \nor C. Comparable exposure and pharmacokinetic profiles were seen in cirrhotic (Child-Pugh Grade A) \nand non-cirrhotic patients.\n\nSite of administration\nSubcutaneous administration of Pegasys should be limited to the abdomen and thigh, as the extent of \nabsorption based on AUC was about 20% to 30% higher upon injection in the abdomen and thigh. \nExposure to Pegasys was decreased in studies following administration of Pegasys in the arm \ncompared to administration in the abdomen and thigh.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe non-clinical toxicity studies conducted with Pegasys were limited due to species specificity of \ninterferons. Acute and chronic toxicity studies have been carried out in cynomolgus monkeys, and the \nfindings observed in peginterferon dosed animals were similar in nature to those produced by \ninterferon alfa-2a.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with Pegasys. As with other alfa interferons, \nprolongation of the menstrual cycle was observed following administration of peginterferon alfa-2a to \nfemale monkeys. Treatment with interferon alfa-2a resulted in a statistically significant increase in \nabortifacient activity in rhesus monkeys. Although no teratogenic effects were seen in the offspring \ndelivered at term, adverse effects in humans cannot be excluded.\n\nPegasys plus ribavirin\nWhen used in combination with ribavirin, Pegasys did not cause any effects in monkeys not previously \nseen with either active substance alone. The major treatment-related change was reversible mild to \nmoderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance \nalone.\n\n\n\n73\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n● If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n● This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n● If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Pegasys is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Pegasys\n3. How to use Pegasys\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Pegasys\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Pegasys is and what it is used for\n\nPegasys contains the active substance peginterferon alfa-2a, which is a long-acting interferon. \nInterferon is a protein that modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections \nand severe diseases. Pegasys is used to treat chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C in adults. It is \nalso used to treat chronic hepatitis B in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older and chronic \nhepatitis C in children and adolescents aged 5 years and older, who have not been treated before. Both \nchronic hepatitis B and C are viral infections of the liver.\n\nChronic Hepatitis B: Pegasys is usually used alone.\nChronic Hepatitis C: Pegasys is used in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of \nchronic hepatitis C (CHC). \n\nRefer also to the package leaflets of any other medicines that are used in combination with Pegasys.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Pegasys\n\nDo not use Pegasys\n● if you are allergic to peginterferon alfa-2a, to any interferon or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6).\n● if you have ever had a heart attack or have been hospitalised for serious chest pains in the last \n\nsix months.\n● if you have, so called autoimmune hepatitis.\n● if you have advanced liver disease and your liver does not work properly (e.g. your skin has \n\nbecome yellow).\n● if the patient is a child less than 3 years old.\n● if the patient is a child who has ever had serious psychiatric conditions such as severe \n\ndepression or thoughts of committing suicide.\n● if you are infected with both the hepatitis C virus and the human immunodeficiency virus, and \n\nyour liver does not work properly (e.g. your skin has become yellow).\n● if you are being treated with telbivudine, a medicine for hepatitis B infection (see “Other \n\nmedicines and Pegasys”).\n\n\n\n107\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse before using Pegasys\n● if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder.\n● if you have ever had depression or symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of \n\nsadness, dejection, etc.).\n● if you are an adult who has or had a  history of substance abuse (e.g. alcohol or drugs)\n● if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Pegasys.\n● if you have a problem with your liver other than hepatitis B or C.\n● if you have diabetes or high blood pressure, your doctor may ask you to have an eye \n\nexamination.\n● if you have been told you have VKH syndrome.\n● if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines.\n● if you have ever had anaemia.\n● if you have had an organ transplant (liver or kidney) or have one planned in the near future.\n● if you are coinfected with HIV and treated with anti HIV medicinal products.\n● if you have been withdrawn from previous therapy for Hepatitis C because of anaemia or low \n\nblood count.\n\nOnce you have started Pegasys treatment, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist:\n● if you develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, dejection, etc.) \n\n(see section 4).\n● if you notice a change in your vision.\n● if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection (such as cough, \n\nfever or any difficulty in breathing).\n● if you think you are getting an infection (such as pneumonia) as when receiving Pegasys you \n\nmay temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection.\n● if you develop any signs of bleeding or unusual bruising, check with your doctor immediately.\n● if you develop signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or \n\nhives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately.\n● if you develop symptoms of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome; combination of complaints of \n\nneck stiffness, headache, loss of colour in skin or hair, eye disorders (such as blurred vision), \nand/or hearing abnormality (such as ringing in the ears).\n\nDuring treatment your doctor will take blood samples regularly to check for changes in your white \nblood cells (cells that fight infection), red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen), platelets (blood clotting \ncells), liver function, glucose (blood sugar levels) or changes in other laboratory values.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nPegasys and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Pegasys with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPegasys use is restricted to children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C aged 5 years and above\nor children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B aged 3 years and above.  Pegasys must not be \ngiven to children below the age of 3 years because it contains benzyl alcohol and may cause toxic \nreactions and allergic reactions in these children. \n If your child has or has ever had a psychiatric disorder, talk to your doctor, who will \n\nmonitor your child for signs or symptoms of depression (see section 4).\n When receiving Pegasys, your child may have slower growth and development (see section 4).\n\nOther medicines and Pegasys\nDo not use Pegasys if you are taking telbivudine (see “Do not use Pegasys”) because the combination \nof these medicines increases the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, and/or \n\n\n\n108\n\nburning sensations in the arms and/or legs). Therefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is \ncontraindicated. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with telbivudine.\nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines for asthma, because the dose for your asthma medicine \nmay need to be changed.\n\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Tell your doctor if you are taking anti-HIV therapy. Lactic \nacidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral \nTherapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of Pegasys + \nribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis or liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for \nsigns and symptoms of these conditions. Patients receiving zidovudine in combination with ribavirin \nand alfa interferons are at increased risk of developing anaemia. Patients receiving azathioprin in \ncombination with ribavirin and peginterferon are at increased risk of developing severe blood \ndisorders. Please be sure to read the ribavirin package leaflet also.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\nWhen Pegasys is used in combination with ribavirin, both male and female patients must take special \nprecautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur, as ribavirin can be \nvery damaging to an unborn baby:\n● if you are a woman of childbearing potential who is taking Pegasys in combination with ribavirin, \nyou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during therapy and for the 4 \nmonths after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are \ntaking the treatment and for 4 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n● if you are a man who is taking Pegasys in combination with ribavirin, do not have sex with a \npregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the \nwoman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant now, but is of childbearing potential, she must \nbe tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. \nYou or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking the treatment \nand for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. It is not known whether this \nproduct is present in human milk.

What Pegasys is and what it is used for\n\nPegasys contains the active substance peginterferon alfa-2a, which is a long-acting interferon. \nInterferon is a protein that modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections \nand severe diseases. Pegasys is used to treat chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C in adults. It is \nalso used to treat chronic hepatitis B in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older and chronic \nhepatitis C in children and adolescents aged 5 years and older, who have not been treated before. Both \nchronic hepatitis B and C are viral infections of the liver.\n\nChronic Hepatitis B: Pegasys is usually used alone.\nChronic Hepatitis C: Pegasys is used in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of \nchronic hepatitis C (CHC). \n\nRefer also to the package leaflets of any other medicines that are used in combination with Pegasys.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Pegasys\n\nDo not use Pegasys\n● if you are allergic to peginterferon-alfa-2a, to any interferon or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6).\n● if you have ever had a heart attack or have been hospitalised for serious chest pains in the last \n\nsix months.\n● if you have, so called autoimmune hepatitis.\n● if you have advanced liver disease and your liver does not work properly (e.g. your skin has \n\nbecome yellow).\n● if the patient is a child less than 3 years old.\n● if the patient is a child who has ever had serious psychiatric conditions such as severe \n\ndepression or thoughts of committing suicide.\n● if you are infected with both the hepatitis C virus and the human immunodeficiency virus, and \n\nyour liver does not work properly (e.g. your skin has become yellow).\n\n\n\n119\n\n● if you are being treated with telbivudine, a medicine for hepatitis B infection (see “Other \nmedicines and Pegasys”).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse before using Pegasys\n● if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder.\n● if you have ever had depression or symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of \n\nsadness, dejection, etc.).\n● if you are an adult who has or had a  history of substance abuse (e.g. alcohol or drugs)\n● if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Pegasys.\n● if you have a problem with your liver other than hepatitis B or C.\n● if you have diabetes or high blood pressure, your doctor may ask you to have an eye \n\nexamination.\n● if you have been told you have VKH syndrome.\n● if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines.\n● if you have ever had anaemia.\n● if you have had an organ transplant (liver or kidney) or have one planned in the near future.\n● if you are coinfected with HIV and treated with anti HIV medicinal products.\n● if you have been withdrawn from previous therapy for Hepatitis C because of anaemia or low \n\nblood count.\n\nOnce you have started Pegasys treatment, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist:\n● if you develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, dejection, etc.) \n\n(see section 4).\n● if you notice a change in your vision.\n● if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection (such as cough, \n\nfever or any difficulty in breathing).\n● if you think you are getting an infection (such as pneumonia) as when receiving Pegasys you \n\nmay temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection.\n● if you develop any signs of bleeding or unusual bruising, check with your doctor immediately.\n● if you develop signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or \n\nhives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately.\n● if you develop symptoms of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome; combination of complaints of \n\nneck stiffness, headache, loss of colour in skin or hair, eye disorders (such as blurred vision), \nand/or hearing abnormality (such as ringing in the ears).\n\nDuring treatment your doctor will take blood samples regularly to check for changes in your white \nblood cells (cells that fight infection), red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen), platelets (blood clotting \ncells), liver function, glucose (blood sugar levels) or changes in other laboratory values.\n\nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving \nPegasys and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on \nteeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Pegasys with \nribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In \naddition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth \nthoroughly afterwards.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPegasys use is restricted to children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C aged 5 years and above \nor children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B aged 3 years and above. Pegasys must not be \ngiven to children below the age of 3 years because it contains benzyl alcohol and may cause toxic \nreactions and allergic reactions in these children.\n If your child has or has ever had a psychiatric disorder, talk to your doctor, who will \n\nmonitor your child for signs or symptoms of depression (see section 4).\n When receiving Pegasys, your child may have slower growth and development (see section 4).\n\n\n\n120\n\nOther medicines and Pegasys\nDo not use Pegasys if you are taking telbivudine (see “Do not use Pegasys”) because the combination \nof these medicines increases the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, and/or \nburning sensations in the arms and/or legs). Therefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is \ncontraindicated. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with telbivudine.\nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines for asthma, because the dose for your asthma medicine \nmay need to be changed.\nPatients who also have HIV infection: Tell your doctor if you are taking anti-HIV therapy. Lactic \nacidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral \nTherapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of Pegasys + \nribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis or liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for \nsigns and symptoms of these conditions. Patients receiving zidovudine in combination with ribavirin \nand alfa interferons are at increased risk of developing anaemia. Patients receiving azathioprin in \ncombination with ribavirin and peginterferon are at increased risk of developing severe blood \ndisorders. Please be sure to read the ribavirin package leaflet also.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\nWhen Pegasys is used in combination with ribavirin, both male and female patients must take special \nprecautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur, as ribavirin can be \nvery damaging to an unborn baby:\n● if you are a woman of childbearing potential who is taking Pegasys in combination with ribavirin, \nyou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during therapy and for the 4 \nmonths after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are \ntaking the treatment and for 4 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n● if you are a man who is taking Pegasys in combination with ribavirin, do not have sex with a \npregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the \nwoman’s body. If your female partner is not pregnant now, but is of childbearing potential, she must \nbe tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. \nYou or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking the treatment \nand for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. It is not known whether this \nproduct is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking Pegasys. In \ncombination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin \ncontaining medicinal products.\n\nRefer also to the package leaflets of any other medicines that are used in combination with Pegasys.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use machinery if you feel drowsy, tired, or confused while taking Pegasys.\n\nPegasys contains benzyl alcohol\nMust not be given to premature babies, neonates or children up to 3 years old. May cause toxic \nreactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old.\n\n3. How to use Pegasys\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\n\n\n121\n\nPegasys dosing\nYour doctor has determined the exact dose of Pegasys, and will tell you how often to use it. If \nnecessary, the dose may be changed during treatment. Do not exceed the recommended dose.\n\nPegasys is used alone only if you cannot take ribavirin for any reason\n\nPegasys given alone or in combination with ribavirin is usually given at a dose of \n180 micrograms once a week.\nThe duration of combination treatment varies from 4 to 18 months depending on the type of \nvirus you are infected with, on treatment response and whether you have been treated before. \nPlease check with your doctor and follow the recommended duration of treatment.\nPegasys injection is normally taken at bedtime.\n\nUse in children  and adolescents\nYour doctor has determined the exact dose of Pegasys for your child and will tell you how often to use \nit. The usual dose of Pegasys is based on your child’s height and weight. If necessary, the dose may be \nchanged during treatment. It is recommended that Pegasys pre-filled syringes be used for children and \nadolescents, as they allow for dose adjustments. Do not exceed the recommended dose.\n\nThe duration of combination treatment in children with chronic hepatitis C varies from 6 to 12 months \ndepending on the type of virus your child is infected with and their response to therapy. In chronic \nhepatitis B the duration of Pegasys treatment is 48 weeks. Please check with your doctor and follow \nthe recommended duration of treatment. Pegasys injection is normally taken at bedtime.\n\nPegasys is intended for subcutaneous use (under the skin). This means that Pegasys is injected with a \nshort needle into the fatty tissue under the skin in the abdomen or thigh. If you are injecting this \nmedicine yourself, you will be instructed how to give the injection. Detailed instructions are provided \nat the end of this leaflet (see “How to inject Pegasys”).\n\nUse Pegasys exactly as described by your doctor, for as long as prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you have the impression that the effect of Pegasys is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C\nIn the case of combination therapy with Pegasys and ribavirin, please follow the dosing regimen \nrecommended by your doctor.\n\nCombination therapy with other medicines in chronic hepatitis C\nIn the case of combination therapy with Pegasys, please follow the dosing regimen recommended \nby your doctor and refer also to the package leaflets of any other medicines that are used in \ncombination with Pegasys.\n\nIf you use more Pegasys than you should\nContact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to take Pegasys\nIf you realise you missed your injection 1 or 2 days after it was scheduled, you should inject your \nrecommended dose as soon as possible. Take your next injection on the regularly scheduled day.\nIf you realise you missed your injection 3 to 5 days after it was scheduled, you should take your \ninjection at the recommended dose as soon as possible. Take your next doses at 5 day intervals until \nyou return to your regularly scheduled day of the week. \n\nAs an example: Your regular weekly Pegasys injection is on Monday. You remember on \nFriday that you forgot to take your injection on Monday (4 days late). You should inject your \nregularly scheduled dose immediately on Friday and take your next injection on Wednesday \n(5 days after your Friday dose). Your next injection will be on the Monday, 5 days later after \nthe Wednesday injection. You are now back on your regularly scheduled day and should \ncontinue your injections every Monday.\n\n\n\n122\n\nIf you realise you missed your injection 6 days after it was scheduled, you should wait and take your \ndose on the next day, your regularly scheduled day.\nContact your doctor or pharmacist if you need any help determining how to manage a missed dose of \nPegasys.\n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSome people get depressed when taking Pegasys alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and \nin some cases people have had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against \nothers such as thoughts about threatening the life of the others). Some patients have actually \ncommitted suicide. Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or \nhave suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want to consider asking a family \nmember or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents):\nSome children and adolescents treated with Pegasys for chronic hepatitis B for 48 weeks did not grow \nor gain weight as much as expected for their age. It is not yet known whether they will return to their \nprojected height and weight after completing treatment.\n\nWith up to one year of treatment with Pegasys in combination with ribavirin, some children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. While most \nchildren returned to their projected height within two years after completing treatment, and the \nmajority of the remaining children within six years after completing treatment, it remains possible that \nPegasys may affect the final adult height.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects: severe chest pain; \npersistent cough; irregular heartbeat; trouble breathing; confusion; depression; severe stomach pain; \nblood in stool (or black, tarry stools); severe nosebleed; fever or chills; problems with your eyesight. \nThese side effects can be serious and you may need urgent medical attention.\n\nVery common side effects with the combination of Pegasys and ribavirin (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people) are:\n\nMetabolic disorders: Loss of appetite\nPsychiatric and nervous system disorders: Feeling depressed (feeling low, feeling bad about yourself \nor feeling hopeless), anxiety, inability to sleep, headache, difficulty concentrating and dizziness\nBreathing disorders: Cough, shortness of breath\nDigestive system disorders: Diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain\nSkin disorders: Loss of hair, and skin reactions (including itching, dermatitis and dry skin)\nMuscle and bone disorders: Pain in joints and muscles\nGeneral disorders: Fever, weakness, tiredness, shaking, chills, pain, injection site irritation and \nirritability (getting easily upset)\n\nCommon side effects with the combination of Pegasys and ribavirin (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nare:\n\nInfections: Fungal, viral and bacterial infections.

Do not touch the tip of the syringe.\n\n● Place the needle firmly on the tip of the syringe (4).\n\n● Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle (5).\n\n● To remove air bubbles from the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Tap the \nsyringe gently to bring the bubbles to the top. Push the plunger up slowly to the correct dose. \nReplace the needle guard and place the syringe in a horizontal position until ready for use.\n\n● Allow the solution to reach room temperature before injection or warm the syringe between \nyour palms.\n\n● Visually inspect the solution prior to administration: do not use if it is discoloured or if particles \nare present.\n\n\n\n129\n\nYou are now ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\n\n● Select the injection site in the abdomen or thigh (except your navel or waistline).
