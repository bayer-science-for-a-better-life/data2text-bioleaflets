NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSoliris 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEculizumab is a humanised monoclonal (IgG2/4\u03ba) antibody produced in NS0 cell line by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nOne vial of 30 ml contains 300 mg of eculizumab (10 mg/ml). \n \nAfter dilution, the final concentration of the solution to be infused is 5 mg/ml. \n \nExcipients with known effect: Sodium (5 mmol per vial) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear, colorless, pH 7.0 solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nSoliris is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of: \n- Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). \n\nEvidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) \nindicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). \n\n- Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (see section 5.1). \n \nSoliris is indicated in adults for the treatment of: \n- Refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor \n\n(AChR) antibody-positive (see section 5.1). \n- Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) \n\nantibody-positive with a relapsing course of the disease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSoliris must be administered by a healthcare professional and under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the management of patients with haematological, renal, neuromuscular or neuro-\ninflammatory disorders. \n \nHome infusion may be considered for patients who have tolerated infusions well in the clinic. The \ndecision of a patient to receive home infusions should be made after evaluation and recommendation from \nthe treating physician. Home infusions should be performed by a qualified healthcare professional. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPosology \n \nAdult Patients: \n \nIn Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH): \nThe PNH dosing regimen for adult patients (\u226518 years of age) consists of a 4-week initial phase followed \nby a maintenance phase: \n\u2022 Initial phase: 600 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 \u2013 45 minute (35 minutes \u00b1 10 minutes) \n\nintravenous infusion every week for the first 4 weeks. \n\u2022 Maintenance phase: 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 \u2013 45 minute (35 minutes \u00b1 10 minutes) \n\nintravenous infusion for the fifth week, followed by 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 \u2013 \n45 minute (35 minutes \u00b1 10 minutes) intravenous infusion every 14 \u00b1 2 days (see section 5.1). \n\n \nIn atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), refractory generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) and \nNeuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): \nThe aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD dosing regimen for adult patients (\u226518 years of age) consists of \na 4 week initial phase followed by a maintenance phase: \n\u2022 Initial phase: 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 \u2013 45 minute (35 minutes \u00b1 10 minutes) \n\nintravenous infusion every week for the first 4 weeks. \n\u2022 Maintenance phase: 1,200 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 \u2013 45 minute (35 minutes \u00b1 10 \n\nminutes) intravenous infusion for the fifth week, followed by 1,200 mg of Soliris administered via \na 25 \u2013 45 minute (35 minutes \u00b1 10 minutes) intravenous infusion every 14 \u00b1 2 days (see section \n5.1). \n\n \nPaediatric patients in PNH and aHUS: \nPaediatric PNH and aHUS patients with body weight \u2265 40 kg are treated with the adult dosing \nrecommendations, respectively.   \n \nIn paediatric PNH and aHUS patients with body weight below 40 kg, the Soliris dosing regimen consists \nof: \n\nPatient Body \nWeight \n\nInitial Phase Maintenance Phase \n\n30 to <40 kg 600 mg weekly x 2 900 mg at week 3; then 900 mg every 2 weeks \n20 to <30 kg 600 mg weekly x 2 600 mg at week 3; then 600 mg every 2 weeks \n10 to <20 kg 600 mg weekly x 1 300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 2 weeks \n5 to <10 kg 300 mg weekly x 1 300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 3 weeks \n\n \nSoliris has not been studied in patients with PNH who weigh less than 40kg. The posology of Soliris for \nPNH patients less than 40kg weight is based on the posology used for patients with aHUS and who weigh \nless than 40kg. \n \nSoliris has not been studied in paediatric patients with refractory gMG or NMOSD. \n \nFor adult aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD patients and paediatric aHUS patients supplemental dosing \nof Soliris is required in the setting of concomitant PE/PI (plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, or fresh \nfrozen plasma infusion): \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n\nType of Plasma \nIntervention \n\nMost Recent \nSoliris Dose \n\nSupplemental Soliris \nDose With Each PE/PI \nIntervention \n\nTiming of \nSupplemental Soliris \nDose \n\nPlasmapheresis or plasma \nexchange \n\n300 mg 300 mg per each \nplasmapheresis or \nplasma exchange \nsession \n\n \n \nWithin 60 minutes after \neach plasmapheresis or \nplasma exchange \u2265600 mg 600 mg per each \n\nplasmapheresis or \nplasma exchange \nsession \n\nFresh frozen plasma \ninfusion \n\n\u2265300 mg 300 mg per infusion of \nfresh frozen plasma \n\n60 minutes prior to each \ninfusion of fresh frozen \nplasma  \n\n \nTreatment monitoring \naHUS patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (see \nsection 4.4 aHUS laboratory monitoring). \nSoliris treatment is recommended to continue for the patient\u2019s lifetime, unless the discontinuation of \nSoliris is clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly \nSoliris may be administered to patients aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that any \nspecial precautions are needed when older people are treated \u2013 although experience with Soliris in this \npatient population is still limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.1). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of Soliris have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \nDo not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Soliris should only be administered via \nintravenous infusion as described below. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \nThe diluted solution of Soliris should be administered by intravenous infusion over 25 \u2013 45 minutes (35 \nminutes \u00b1 10 minutes) in adults and 1-4 hours in paediatric patients under 18 years of age via gravity feed, \na syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. It is not necessary to protect the diluted solution of Soliris from \nlight during administration to the patient. \nPatients should be monitored for one hour following infusion. If an adverse event occurs during the \nadministration of Soliris, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the \ninfusion is slowed, the total infusion time may not exceed two hours in adults and four hours in paediatric \npatients under 18 years of age. \n \nThere is limited safety data supporting home-based infusions, additional precautions in the home setting \nsuch as availability of emergency treatment of infusion reactions or anaphylaxis are recommended. \nInfusion reactions are described in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 on the SmPC. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nRefractory gMG \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of Soliris treatment. \nDiscontinuation of the therapy should be considered in a patient who shows no evidence of therapeutic \nbenefit by 12 weeks. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to eculizumab, murine proteins or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSoliris therapy must not be initiated in patients (see section 4.4): \n\n- with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection \n- who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive prophylactic \n\ntreatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSoliris is not expected to affect the aplastic component of anaemia in patients with PNH. \n \nMeningococcal Infection \nDue to its mechanism of action, the use of Soliris increases the patient\u2019s susceptibility to meningococcal \ninfection (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may occur. To reduce the \nrisk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris unless the risk \nof delaying Soliris therapy outweighs the risks of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who \ninitiate Soliris treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine must \nreceive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines \nagainst serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 and B where available, are recommended in preventing the commonly \npathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Patients must receive vaccination according to current national \nvaccination guidelines for vaccination use.  \n \nVaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, \nincluding PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD, may experience increased signs and symptoms of \ntheir underlying disease, such as haemolysis (PNH), TMA (aHUS), MG exacerbation (refractory gMG) or \nrelapse (NMOSD). Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after \nrecommended vaccination. \n \nVaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given to \nofficial guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious or fatal meningococcal \ninfections have been reported in Soliris-treated patients. Sepsis is a common presentation of \nmeningococcal infections in patients treated with Soliris (see section 4.8). All patients should be \nmonitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and \ntreated with appropriate antibiotics if necessary. Patients should be informed of these signs and symptoms \nand steps taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of Soliris \ntherapy with patients and provide them with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card (see \nPackage Leaflet for a description).  \n \nOther Systemic Infections \nDue to its mechanism of action, Soliris therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active \nsystemic infections. Patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with Neisseria and \nencapsulated bacteria. Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), \nincluding disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. \nPatients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet to increase their awareness of \npotential serious infections and the signs and symptoms of them. Physicians should advise patients about \ngonorrhoea prevention. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nInfusion Reactions \nAdministration of Soliris may result in infusion reactions or immunogenicity that could cause allergic or \nhypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). In clinical trials, 1 (0.9%) gMG patient experienced an \ninfusion reaction which required discontinuation of Soliris. No PNH, aHUS or NMOSD patients \nexperienced an infusion reaction which required discontinuation of Soliris. Soliris administration should \nbe interrupted in all patients experiencing severe infusion reactions and appropriate medical therapy \nadministered. \n \nImmunogenicity \nInfrequent antibody responses have been detected in Soliris-treated patients across all clinical studies. In \nPNH placebo controlled studies low antibody responses have been reported with a frequency (3.4%) \nsimilar to that of placebo (4.8%).  \nIn patients with aHUS treated with Soliris, antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3/100 (3%) by the ECL \nbridging format assay. 1/100 (1%) aHUS patients had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies. \nIn a refractory gMG placebo controlled study, none (0/62) of the Soliris treated patients showed antidrug \nantibody response during the 26 week active treatment, whereas in a refractory gMG extension study, a \ntotal of 2.6% overall were positive for ADAs at any post-baseline visit. Positive ADA results appeared to \nbe transient, as positive titers were not observed at subsequent visits, and there were no clinical findings in \nthese patients suggestive of an effect of positive ADA titers. \nIn a NMOSD placebo controlled study, 2/95 (2.1%) of the Soliris treated patients showed antidrug \nantibody response post-baseline. Both patients were negative for neutralizing antibodies. Positive ADA \nsamples were low titer and transient. There has been no observed correlation of antibody development to \nclinical response or adverse events. \n \nImmunization \nPrior to initiating Soliris therapy, it is recommended that PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG  and NMOSD \npatients initiate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Additionally, all patients \nmust be vaccinated against meningococcal infections at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris unless the \nrisk of delaying Soliris therapy outweighs the risks of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who \ninitiate Soliris treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine must \nreceive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines \nagainst serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 and B where available are recommended in preventing the commonly \npathogenic meningococcal serogroups. (see Meningococcal Infection). \n \nPatients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal \ninfections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group. \n \nVaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, \nincluding PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD may experience increased signs and symptoms of \ntheir underlying disease, such as haemolysis (PNH), TMA (aHUS), MG exacerbation (refractory gMG) or \nrelapse (NMOSD). Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after \nrecommended vaccination. \n \nAnticoagulant therapy \nTreatment with Soliris should not alter anticoagulant management.  \n \nImmunosuppressant and anticholinesterase therapies \n \nRefractory gMG \nWhen immunosuppressant and anticholinesterase therapies are decreased or discontinued, patients should \nbe monitored closely for signs of disease exacerbation.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNeuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder \nWhen immunosuppressant therapy is decreased or discontinued, patients should be monitored closely for \nsigns and symptoms of potential NMOSD relapse. \n \n. \nPNH Laboratory Monitoring \nPNH patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of intravascular haemolysis, including serum \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. PNH patients receiving Soliris therapy should be similarly monitored \nfor intravascular haemolysis by measuring LDH levels, and may require dose adjustment within the \nrecommended 14\u00b12 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to every 12 days).  \n \naHUS Laboratory Monitoring \naHUS patients receiving Soliris therapy should be monitored for thrombotic microangiopathy by \nmeasuring platelet counts, serum LDH and serum creatinine, and may require dose adjustment within the \nrecommended 14\u00b12 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to every 12 days). \n \nTreatment Discontinuation for PNH \nIf PNH patients discontinue treatment with Soliris they should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis. Serious haemolysis is identified by serum LDH levels \ngreater than the pre-treatment level, along with any of the following: greater than 25% absolute decrease \nin PNH clone size (in the absence of dilution due to transfusion) in one week or less; a haemoglobin level \nof <5 g/dL or a decrease of >4 g/dL in one week or less; angina; change in mental status; a 50% increase \nin serum creatinine level; or thrombosis. Monitor any patient who discontinues Soliris for at least 8 weeks \nto detect serious haemolysis and other reactions. \nIf serious haemolysis occurs after Soliris discontinuation, consider the following procedures/treatments: \nblood transfusion (packed RBCs), or exchange transfusion if the PNH RBCs are >50% of the total RBCs \nby flow cytometry; anticoagulation; corticosteroids; or reinstitution of Soliris. In PNH clinical studies, 16 \npatients discontinued the Soliris treatment regimen. Serious haemolysis was not observed. \n \nTreatment Discontinuation for aHUS \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications have been observed as early as 4 weeks and up to 127 \nweeks following discontinuation of Soliris treatment in some patients. Discontinuation of treatment should \nonly be considered if medically justified. \n \nIn aHUS clinical studies, 61 patients (21 paediatric patients) discontinued Soliris treatment with a median \nfollow-up period of 24 weeks. Fifteen severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications in 12 \npatients were observed following treatment discontinuation, and 2 severe TMA complications occurred in \nan additional 2 patients that received a reduced dosing regimen of Soliris outside of the approved dosing \nregimen (See Section 4.2).  Severe TMA complications occurred in patients regardless of whether they \nhad an identified genetic mutation, high risk polymorphism or auto-antibody. Additional serious medical \ncomplications occurred in these patients including severe worsening of kidney function, disease-related \nhospitalization and progression to end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Despite Soliris re-initiation \nfollowing discontinuation, progression to end stage renal disease occurred in one patient.  \n \nIf aHUS patients discontinue treatment with Soliris, they should be monitored closely for signs and \nsymptoms of severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications. Monitoring may be insufficient to predict \nor prevent severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications in patients with aHUS after discontinuation \nof Soliris. \nSevere thrombotic microangiopathy complications post discontinuation can be identified by (i)  any two, \nor repeated measurement of any one, of the following: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or more as \ncompared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during Soliris treatment; an increase in serum \ncreatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during Soliris treatment; or, an increase in \n\n\n\n8 \n\nserum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during Soliris treatment; or (ii) any one of \nthe following: a change in mental status or seizures; angina or dyspnoea; or thrombosis. \n \nIf severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications occur after Soliris discontinuation, consider \nreinstitution of Soliris treatment, supportive care with PE/PI, or appropriate organ-specific supportive \nmeasures including renal support with dialysis, respiratory support with mechanical ventilation or \nanticoagulation.   \n \nTreatment discontinuation for refractory gMG:  \nUse of Soliris in refractory gMG treatment has been studied only in the setting of chronic administration. \nPatients who discontinue Soliris treatment should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of \ndisease exacerbation. \n \nTreatment discontinuation for NMOSD: \nUse of Soliris in NMOSD treatment has been studied only in the setting of chronic administration \nand the effect of Soliris discontinuation has not been characterized. Patients who discontinue \nSoliris treatment should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of potential NMOSD \nrelapse. \n \nEducational materials \nAll physicians who intend to prescribe Soliris must ensure they are familiar with the physician\u2019s guide to \nprescribing. Physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of Soliris therapy with patients and provide \nthem with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card.  \nPatients should be instructed that if they develop fever, headache accompanied with fever and/or stiff neck \nor sensitivity to light, they should immediately seek medical care as these signs may be indicative of \nmeningococcal infection. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains 5 mmol sodium per vial. It should be taken into consideration by patients \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of eculizumab on \ncomplement-dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, eculizumab may reduce the expected pharmacodynamic \neffects of rituximab. \n \nChronic intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal \nFc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as eculizumab and thereby decrease \nserum eculizumab concentrations. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and for at least 5 months after the last dose of \ntreatment with eculizumab should be considered for women of childbearing potential. \n\nPregnancy \nThere are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with eculizumab. Data on a limited \nnumber of pregnancies exposed to eculizumab (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate there is no \nincreased  risk of foetal malformation or foetal-neonatal toxicity. However, due to the lack of well-\ncontrolled studies, uncertainties remain. Therefore, an individual risk benefit analysis is recommended \nbefore starting and during treatment with eculizumab in pregnant women. Should such a treatment be \n\n\n\n9 \n\nconsidered necessary during pregnancy, a close maternal and foetal monitoring according to local \nguidelines is recommended. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab (see section 5.3).  \n \nHuman IgG are known to cross the human placental barrier, and thus eculizumab may potentially cause \nterminal complement inhibition in the foetal circulation. Therefore, Soliris should be given to a pregnant \nwoman only if clearly needed.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo effects on the breastfed newborn / infant are anticipated as limited data available suggest that \neculizumab is not excreted in human breast milk. However, due to the limitations of the available data, the \ndevelopmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical \nneed for eculizumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from eculizumab or from the \nunderlying maternal condition. \n \nFertility \nNo specific study of eculizumab on fertility has been conducted. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSoliris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nSupportive safety data were obtained from 31 completed clinical studies that included 1,503 patients \nexposed to eculizumab in complement-mediated disease populations, including PNH, aHUS, refractory \ngMG and NMOSD. The most common adverse reaction was headache, (occurred mostly in the initial \nphase of dosing), and the most serious adverse reaction was meningococcal sepsis. \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in eculizumab completed \nclinical trials, including PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD studies. Adverse reactions reported at \na very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) or rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) frequency with eculizumab, are listed by system organ class and preferred term. \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions reported in eculizumab clinical trials, including patients with PNH, \naHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD as well as from postmarketing experience \nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n \n\nVery \nCommon \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \n\nInfection and \ninfestations \n\n Pneumonia, Upper \nrespiratory tract \ninfection, \nBronchitis, \nNasopharyngitis, \nUrinary tract \ninfection, Oral \nHerpes  \n\nMeningococcal \ninfectionb, Sepsis, \nSeptic shock, \nPeritonitis, Lower \nrespiratory tract \ninfection, Fungal \ninfection, Viral \ninfection, Abscessa, \nCellulitis, Influenza, \nGastrointestinal \ninfection, Cystitis, \nInfection, Sinusitis,  \n\nAspergillus infectionc, \nArthritis bacterialc, \nGenitourinary tract \ngonococcal infection,  \nHaemophilus influenzae \ninfection,  \nImpetigo,  \nGingivitis  \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts and \npolyps) \n\n   Malignant melanoma, \nMyelodysplastic syndrome  \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n Leukopenia, \nAnaemia  \n\nThrombocytopenia, \nLymphopenia  \n\nHaemolysis*, Abnormal \nclotting factor, Red blood \ncell agglutination, \nCoagulopathy  \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaphylactic reaction, \nHypersensitivity  \n\n \n\nEndocrine disorders    Basedow\u2019s disease  \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n  Decreased appetite   \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Insomnia  Depression, Anxiety, \nMood swings  \n\nAbnormal dreams, Sleep \ndisorder  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache  Dizziness, \nDysgeusia  \n\nParaesthesia, Tremor Syncope  \n\nEye disorders   Vision blurred  Conjunctival irritation  \nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Tinnitus, Vertigo   \n\nCardiac disorders   Palpitation   \nVascular disorders  Hypertension Accelerated \n\nhypertension, \nHypotension, Hot \nflush, Vein disorder  \n\nHaematoma \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough, \nOropharyngeal pain \n\nDyspnoea, Epistaxis, \nThroat irritation, Nasal \ncongestion, \nRhinorrhoea \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Diarrhoea, \nVomiting, Nausea, \nAbdominal pain \n\nConstipation, \nDyspepsia, Abdominal \ndistension  \n\nGastroesophageal reflux \ndisease, Gingival pain \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n   Jaundice  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Rash, Pruritus, \nAlopecia \n\nUrticaria, Erythema, \nPetechiae, \nHyperhidrosis, Dry \nskin \n\nDermatitis, Skin \ndepigmentation \n\n\n\n11 \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Arthralgia, Myalgia,  Muscle spasms, Bone \npain, Back pain, Neck \npain, Joint swelling, \nPain in extremity \n\nTrismus  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  Renal impairment, \nDysuria, Haematuria \n\n \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\n  Spontaneous penile \nerection,  \n\nMenstrual disorder \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\n Pyrexia, Fatigue, \nInfluenza like illness \n\nEdema, Chest \ndiscomfort, Asthenia, \nChest pain, Infusion \nsite pain, Chills \n\nExtravasation, Infusion site \nparaesthesia, Feeling hot  \n\nInvestigations   Alanine \naminotransferase \nincreased, Aspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased, Gamma-\nglutamyltransferase \nincreased, Haematocrit \ndecreased, \nHaemoglobin \ndecreased \n\nCoombs test positivec  \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplication \n \n\n  Infusion related \nreaction \n\n \n\nIncluded Studies: Asthma (C07-002), aHUS(C08-002, C08-003, C10-003, C10-004), Dermatomyositis (C99-006), \ngMG (C08-001, ECU-MG-301, ECU-MG-302), Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (ECU-NMO-301), IMG \n(C99-004, E99-004), PNH (C02-001, C04-001, C04-002, C06-002, C07-001, E02-001, E05-001, E07-001, M07-005, \nX03-001, X03-001A), Psoriasis (C99-007), RA (C01-004, C97-001, C99-001, E01-004, E99-001), STEC-HUS \n(C11-001), SLE (C97-002).

In refractory gMG \nplacebo-controlled studies, no antidrug antibodies were observed. As with all proteins there is a potential \nfor immunogenicity. \n \nCases of haemolysis have been reported in the setting of missed or delayed Soliris dose in PNH clinical \ntrials (see also Section 4.4). \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy complication have been reported in the setting of missed or delayed \nSoliris dose in aHUS clinical trials (see also Section 4.4). \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nPaediatric population  \nIn children and adolescent PNH patients (aged 11 years to less than 18 years) included in the paediatric \nPNH Study M07-005, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult PNH patients. The most \ncommon adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was headache.  \n \nIn paediatric aHUS patients (aged 2 months to less than 18 years) included in the aHUS studies C08-002, \nC08-003, C09-001r and C10-003, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult aHUS \npatients. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age appear similar. \n \nSoliris has not been studied in paediatric patients with refractory gMG or NMOSD. \n \nElderly population \nNo overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (\u2265 65 years) and younger refractory gMG \npatients (< 65 years) (see section 5.1).  \n \nPatients with other diseases \nSafety Data from Other Clinical Studies  \nSupportive safety data were obtained in 12 completed clinical studies that included 934 patients exposed \nto eculizumab in other disease populations other than PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG or NMOSD. There \nwas an un-vaccinated patient diagnosed with idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy who \nexperienced meningococcal meningitis. Adverse reactions reported in patients with disease other than \nPNH, aHUS, refractory gMG or NMOSD were similar to those reported in patients with PNH, aHUS, \nrefractory gMG or NMOSD (see Table 1 above). No specific adverse reactions have emerged from these \nclinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA25 \n \nSoliris is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG2/4k antibody that binds to the human C5 complement \nprotein and inhibits the activation of terminal complement. The Soliris antibody contains human constant \nregions and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted onto the human framework light- and \nheavy-chain variable regions. Soliris is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino \nacid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa. \n \nSoliris is produced in a murine myeloma (NS0 cell line) expression system and purified by affinity and ion \nexchange chromatography. The bulk drug substance manufacturing process also includes specific viral \ninactivation and removal steps. \n \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\n \nMechanism of action \n \nEculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to \nthe complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and \npreventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab preserves the early \ncomponents of complement activation that are essential for opsonization of microorganisms and clearance \nof immune complexes. \n \nIn PNH patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated \nintravascular haemolysis are blocked with Soliris treatment.   \nIn most PNH patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of approximately 35 microgram/mL are sufficient \nfor essentially complete inhibition of terminal complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis. \nIn PNH, chronic administration of Soliris resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in complement-\nmediated haemolytic activity.   \n \nIn aHUS patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated \nthrombotic microangiopathy are blocked with Soliris treatment.   \nAll patients treated with Soliris when administered as recommended demonstrated rapid and sustained \nreduction in terminal complement activity. In all aHUS patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of \napproximately 50 - 100 microgram/mL are sufficient for essentially complete inhibition of terminal \ncomplement activity.  \nIn aHUS, chronic administration of Soliris resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in complement-\nmediated thrombotic microangiopathy. \n \nIn refractory gMG patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation causes membrane attack \ncomplex (MAC) dependent lysis and C5a-dependent inflammation at the Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ) \nleading to failure of neuromuscular transmission. Chronic administration of Soliris results in immediate, \ncomplete, and sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity (eculizumab serum concentrations \u2265 \n116 microgram/ml). \n \nIn patients with NMOSD, uncontrolled terminal complement activation caused by autoantibodies against \nAQP4 leads to the formation of the MAC and C5a-dependent inflammation which results in astrocyte \nnecrosis and increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, as well as death of the surrounding \noligodendrocytes and neurons. Chronic administration of Soliris results in immediate, complete, and \nsustained inhibition of terminal complement activity (eculizumab serum concentrations \u2265 116 \nmicrogram/ml). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nParoxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with haemolysis were assessed in a randomized, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (C04-001).  PNH patients were also treated with Soliris in \na single arm 52 week study (C04-002), and in a long term extension study (E05-001). Patients received \nmeningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab was 600 mg \nevery 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the \nstudy duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 \u2013 45 minutes (35 minutes \u00b1 10 \nminutes). An observational non-interventional Registry in patients with PNH (M07-001) was also initiated \nto characterize the natural history of PNH in untreated patients and the clinical outcomes during Soliris \ntreatment. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn study C04-001 (TRIUMPH) PNH patients with at least 4 transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow \ncytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were \nrandomized to either Soliris (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an \ninitial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the haemoglobin \nconcentration (the \"set-point\") which would define each patient\u2019s haemoglobin stabilization and \ntransfusion outcomes. The haemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with \nsymptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Primary efficacy endpoints \nwere haemoglobin stabilization (patients who maintained a haemoglobin concentration above the \nhaemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week period) and blood \ntransfusion requirement. Fatigue and health-related quality of life were relevant secondary endpoints. \nHaemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH \nRBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at \nbaseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced (see Table 2).  \n \nIn the non-controlled study C04-002 (SHEPHERD), PNH patients with at least one transfusion in the prior \n24 months and at least 30,000 platelets/microliter received Soliris over a 52-week period. Concomitant \nmedications included anti-thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of \nthe patients.  Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Patient Demographics and Characteristics in C04-001 and C04-002  \n\n C04-001 C04-002 \n\nParameter Placebo N = 44 \nSoliris \nN = 43 \n\nSoliris \nN = 97 \n\nMean Age (SD) 38.4 (13.4) 42.1 (15.5) 41.1 (14.4) \nGender - Female (%) 29 (65.9) 23 (53.5) 49 (50.5) \nHistory of Aplastic Anaemia or MDS (%) 12 (27.3) 8 (18.7) 29 (29.9) \nConcomitant Anticoagulants (%) 20 (45.5) 24 (55.8) 59 (61) \nConcomitant Steroids/Immunosuppressant \nTreatments (%) 16 (36.4) 14 (32.6) 46 (47.4) \n\nDiscontinued treatment 10 2 1 \nPRBC in previous 12 months (median \n(Q1,Q3)) 17.0 (13.5, 25.0) \n\n18.0 (12.0, \n24.0) 8.0 (4.0, 24.0) \n\nMean Hgb level (g/dL) at setpoint (SD) 7.7 (0.75) 7.8 (0.79) N/A \nPre-treatment LDH levels (median, U/L) 2,234.5 2,032.0 2,051.0 \nFree Haemoglobin at baseline (median, \nmg/dL)  \n\n46.2 40.5 34.9 \n\n \nIn TRIUMPH, study patients treated with Soliris had significantly reduced (p< 0.001) haemolysis \nresulting in improvements in anaemia as indicated by increased haemoglobin stabilization and reduced \nneed for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 3). These effects were seen \namong patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; \n> 25 units). After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related \nquality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of Soliris on thrombotic events \ncould not be determined. In SHEPHERD study, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one \npatient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum \nLDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in increased transfusion avoidance, a \nreduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue.

All patients sustained a reduction in \nintravascular haemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were \nfewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. \nHowever, this finding was shown in non-controlled clinical trials. \n\nThe PNH registry (M07-001) was used to evaluate the efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with no history \nof RBC transfusion. These patients had high disease activity as defined by elevated haemolysis (LDH \n\u22651.5x ULN) and the presence of  related clinical symptom(s): fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, \nshortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia (haemoglobin <100 g/L), major adverse vascular event (including \nthrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction.  \n\nIn the PNH Registry, patients treated with Soliris were observed to have a reduction in haemolysis and \nassociated symptoms. At 6 months, patients treated with Soliris with no history of RBC transfusion had \nsignificantly (p<0.001) reduced LDH levels (median LDH of 305 U/L; Table 4). Furthermore, 74% of the \npatients without a history of transfusion and treated with Soliris experienced clinically meaningful \nimprovements in FACIT-Fatigue score (i.e., increase by 4 points or more) and 84% in EORTC fatigue \nscore (i.e., decrease by 10 points or more).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy Outcomes (LDH level and FACIT-Fatigue) in Patients with PNH with No History \nof Transfusion in M07-001 \n\n M07-001  \n\nParameter  Soliris \nNo transfusion \n\nLDH level at baseline \n(median , U/L)  \n\nN=43 \n1447 \n\nLDH level at 6 months \n(median, U/L)  \n\nN=36 \n305 \n\nFACIT-Fatigue score at baseline \n(median)  \n\nN=25 \n32 \n\nFACIT-Fatigue score at last available \nassessment (median)  \n\nN=31 \n44 \n\nFACIT-Fatigue is measured on a scale of 0-52, with higher values indicating less fatigue \n \nAtypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome \n \nData from 100 patients in four prospective controlled studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (C08-\n002A/B  C08-003A/B, C10-004) one in paediatric and adolescent patients (C10-003 ) and 30 patients in \none retrospective study (C09-001r) were used to evaluate the efficacy of Soliris in the treatment of aHUS. \n \nStudy C08-002A/B was a prospective, controlled, open-label study which accrued patients in the early \nphase of aHUS with evidence of clinical thrombotic microangiopathy manifestations with platelet count \u2264 \n150 x 109/L despite PE/PI, and LDH and serum creatinine above upper limits of normal. \nStudy C08-003A/B was a prospective, controlled, open-label study which accrued patients with longer \nterm aHUS without apparent evidence of clinical thrombotic microangiopathy manifestations and \nreceiving chronic PE/PI (\u22651 PE/PI treatment every two weeks and no more than 3 PE/PI treatments/week \nfor at least 8 weeks before the first dose). Patients in both prospective studies were treated with Soliris for \n26 weeks and most patients enrolled into a long-term, open-label extension study. All patients enrolled in \nboth prospective studies had an ADAMTS-13 level above 5%. \n \nPatients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris or received prophylactic treatment \nwith appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of Soliris in adult and \nadolescent aHUS patients was 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days \nlater, then 1,200 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the study duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous \ninfusion over 35 minutes. The dosing regimen in paediatric patients and adolescents weighing less than \n40 kg was defined based on a pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation that identified the recommended dose and \nschedule based on body weight (see section 4.2). \n \nPrimary endpoints included platelet count change from baseline in study C08-002A/B and thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA) event-free status in study C08-003A/B. Additional endpoints included TMA \nintervention rate, haematologic normalization, complete TMA response, changes in LDH, renal function \nand quality of life. TMA-event free status was defined as the absence for at least 12 weeks of the \nfollowing: decrease in platelet count of > 25% from baseline, PE/PI, and new dialysis. TMA interventions \nwere defined as PE/PI or new dialysis. Haematologic normalization was defined as normalization of \nplatelet counts and LDH levels sustained for \u22652 consecutive measurements for \u22654 weeks. Complete TMA \nresponse was defined as haematologic normalization and a \u226525% reduction in serum creatinine sustained \nin \u2265 2 consecutive measurements for \u2265 4 weeks. \nBaseline characteristics are shown in Table 5.  \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 5: Patient Demographics and Characteristics in C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B  \nParameter C08-002A/B C08-003A/B \n\nSoliris  \nN = 17 \n\nSoliris  \nN = 20 \n\nTime from first diagnosis until screening in \nmonths, median (min, max) \n\n10 (0.26, 236) 48 (0.66, 286) \n\nTime from current clinical TMA \nmanifestation until screening in months, \nmedian (min, max) \n\n< 1 (<1, 4) 9 (1, 45) \n\nNumber of PE/PI sessions for current \nclinical TMA manifestation, median (min, \nmax) \n\n17 (2, 37) 62 (20, 230) \n\nNumber of PE/PI sessions in 7 days prior to \nfirst dose of eculizumab, median (min, max) \n\n6 (0, 7) 2 (1, 3) \n\nBaseline platelet count (\u00d7 109/L), mean (SD) 109 (32) 228 (78) \nBaseline LDH (U/L), mean (SD) 323 (138) 223 (70) \nPatients without identified mutation, n (%) 4 (24) 6 (30) \n\n \nPatients in aHUS Study C08-002 A/B received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks.

In aHUS Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of Soliris therapy was \napproximately100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks). \nA reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were \nobserved after commencement of Soliris. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all \npatients after commencement of Soliris. Table 6 summarizes the efficacy results for aHUS Study C08-\n002A/B. All rates of efficacy endpoints improved or were maintained through 2 years of treatment. \nComplete TMA response was maintained by all responders. When treatment was continued for more than \n26 weeks, two additional patients achieved and maintained Complete TMA response due to normalization \nof LDH (1 patient) and a decrease in serum creatinine (2 patients).  \nRenal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during Soliris therapy. Four of the \nfive patients who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis for the duration of \nSoliris treatment, and one patient developed a new dialysis requirement. Patients reported improved \nhealth-related quality of life (QoL). \n \nIn aHUS Study C08-002A/B, responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified \nmutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins. \n \nPatients in aHUS study C08-003A/B received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of the \ninitial 26-week treatment period, most patients continued to receive Soliris by enrolling into an extension \nstudy. In aHUS Study C08-003A/B, the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 114 weeks \n(range: 26 to 129 weeks). Table 6 summarizes the efficacy results for aHUS Study C08-003A/B. \nIn aHUS Study C08-003A/B, responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified \nmutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.

Complete TMA response was maintained by \nall responders. When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, six additional patients achieved \nand maintained Complete TMA response due to a decrease in serum creatinine. No patient required new \ndialysis with Soliris.

In aHUS C10-004, mean (\u00b1SD) \nplatelet count increased from 119 \u00b1 66 x109/L at baseline to 200 \u00b1 84 x109/L by one week; this effect was \nmaintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1SD) at week 26: 252 \u00b1 70 x109/L). Renal function, as \nmeasured by eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis \nat baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during Soliris treatment.

When Soliris \ntreatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, three additional patients (63% of patients in total) \nachieved Complete TMA response and four additional patients (98% of patients in total) achieved \nhematologic normalization.

One \nhundred and eighteen (118) of the 125 (94%) patients completed the 26-week treatment period and \n117 (94%) patients subsequently enrolled in Study ECU-MG-302, an open-label, multi-center long-term \nsafety and efficacy extension study in which all patients received Soliris treatment. \n \nIn Study ECU-MG-301, gMG patients with a positive serologic test for anti-AChR antibodies, MGFA \n(Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) clinical classification class II to IV and MG-ADL total score \n\u22656 were randomized to either Soliris (n = 62) or placebo (n = 63). All patients included in the trial were \nrefractory gMG patients and met the following predefined criteria: \n \n1) Failed treatment for at least one year with 2 or more immunosuppressant therapies (either in \ncombination or as monotherapy), ie, patients continued to have impairment in activities of daily living \ndespite immunosuppressant therapies \n \nOR \n \n2) Failed at least one immunosuppressant therapy and required chronic plasma exchange or IVIg to \ncontrol symptoms, ie, patients require PE or IVIg on a regular basis for the management of muscle \nweakness at least every 3 months over previous 12 months. \n \nPatients received meningococcal vaccination prior to initiating treatment with Soliris or received \nprophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In Studies ECU-MG-\n301 and ECU-MG-302, the dose of Soliris in adult refractory gMG patients was 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days \nfor 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg at Week 5\u00b1 2 days, then 1,200 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the study \nduration.

In \nthis setting, 65.0% of patients decreased their daily dose of at least 1 immunosuppressive therapy (IST); \n43.6% of patients stopped an existing IST. The most common reason for change in IST therapy was \nimprovement in MG symptoms.  \n \nTwenty-two (22) (17.6%) elderly refractory gMG patients (> 65 years of age) were treated with Soliris in \nthe clinical trials. No substantial differences were seen in safety and efficacy related to age. \n \nNeuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder \n \nData from 143 patients in one controlled study (Study ECU-NMO-301) and from 119 patients who \ncontinued in one open-label extension trial (Study ECU-NMO-302) were used to evaluate the efficacy and \nsafety of Soliris in the treatment of patients with NMOSD.  \n \nStudy ECU-NMO-301 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 3 study of \nSoliris in patients with NMOSD.  \n \nIn Study ECU-NMO-301, patients with NMOSD with a positive serologic test for anti-AQP4 antibodies, a \nhistory of at least 2 relapses in last 12 months or 3 relapses in the last 24 months with at least 1 relapse in \nthe 12 months prior to screening and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \u2264 7, were \nrandomized 2:1 to either Soliris (n = 96) or placebo (n = 47). Patients were permitted to receive \nbackground immunosuppressant therapies at stable dose during the study, with the exclusion of rituximab \nand mitoxantrone. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nPatients either received meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment with \nSoliris or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In \nthe eculizumab NMOSD clinical development program, the dose of Soliris in adult patients with NMOSD \nwas 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg at Week 5 \u00b1 2 days, then 1200 mg every \n14 \u00b1 2 days for the study duration.

Fifty percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor \nmutation or auto-antibody. A total of 10 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 17 summarizes \nthe key baseline clinical and disease-related characteristics of patients enrolled in aHUS Study C10-003. \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTable 17:  Baseline Characteristics of Paediatric and Adolescents Patients Enrolled in aHUS Study \nC10-003    \n\nParameter \n1 month to <12 years \n\n(N = 18)  \n \n\n All Patients \n(N = 22)  \n\n \n\nTime from aHUS diagnosis until first study dose \n(months) median (min, max  ) 0.51 (0.03, 58) 0.56 (0.03,191) \n\nTime from current clinical TMA manifestation \nuntil first study dose  (months), median ( min, \nmax) \n\n0.23 (0.03, 4) 0.20 (0.03, 4) \n\nBaseline platelet count (x 109/L), median ( min, \nmax) 110 (19, 146) 91 (19,146) \n\nBaseline LDH (U/L) median (min, max ) 1510 (282, 7164) 1244 (282, 7164) \n\nBaseline  eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2 ), median (min, \nmax) 22 (10, 105) 22 (10, 105) \n\n \n\nPatients in aHUS C10-003 received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. After completion of the initial 26-\nweek treatment period, most patients elected to continue on chronic dosing. Reduction in terminal \ncomplement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of \ncomplement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 \nweeks. The mean (\u00b1SD) platelet count increased from 88 \u00b1 42 x109/L at baseline to 281 \u00b1 123 x109/L by \none week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1SD) at week 26: 293 \u00b1 106 \nx109/L). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Nine of the 11 \npatients who required dialysis at baseline no longer required dialysis after Study Day 15 of eculizumab \ntreatment. Responses were similar across all ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. In aHUS C10-003, \nresponses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding \ncomplement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.   \n\nTable 18 summarizes the efficacy results for aHUS C10-003. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTable 18:  Efficacy Outcomes in Prospective aHUS Study C10-003    \n\nEfficacy Parameter \n1 month to <12 years \n\n(N = 18) \nAt 26-weeks \n\nAll Patients  \n(N = 22)   \n\nAt 26-weeks \n\nComplete Hematologic Normalization, n (%)  \nMedian Duration of complete hematologic \nnormalization, weeks (range) 1 \n\n14 (78) \n35 (13, 78) \n\n18 (82) \n 35 (13, 78) \n\nComplete TMA response, n (%) \n\nMedian Duration of complete TMA response, \nweeks (range)1 \n\n11 (61) \n\n40 (13, 78) \n\n14 (64) \n\n37 (13, 78) \n\nTMA Event-Free Status, n (%) \n      95% CI  \n\n17 (94) \nNA \n\n21 (96) \n77; 99 \n\nDaily TMA Intervention rate, median (range) \n     Before eculizumab treatment, median    \n     On eculizumab treatment, median \n\nNA \nNA \n\n0.4 (0, 1.7) \n0 (0, 1.01) \n\neGFR improvement \u226515 mL/min/ 1.73\u2022m2, n (%) 16 (89) 19 (86) \n\nChange in eGFR ( \u226515 mL/min/1.73\u2022m2) at 26 \nweeks, median (range) 64 (0,146) 58 (0, 146) \n\nCKD improvement by \u22651 stage, n (%) 14/16 (88) 17/20 (85) \n\nPE/PI Event-Free Status, n (%) \nNew Dialysis Event-Free Status, n (%) \n      95% CI \n\n16 (89) \n18 (100) \n\nNA \n\n20 (91) \n22 (100) \n85;100 \n\n1 Through data cut-off (October 12, 2012), with median duration of Soliris therapy of 44 weeks (range: 1 dose to 88 \nweeks). \n\n \nLonger term treatment with Soliris (median 55 weeks ranging from 1day to 107 weeks) was associated \nwith an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in paediatric and adolescent patients with \naHUS. When Soliris treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, one additional patient (68% of \npatients in total) achieved Complete TMA Response and two additional patients (91% of patients in total) \nachieved hematologic normalization. At the last evaluation, 19 of 22 patients (86%) achieved eGFR \nimprovement of  \u2265 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. No patient required new dialysis with Soliris. \n \nRefractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis \nSoliris has not been evaluated in paediatric patients with refractory gMG. \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Soliris in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of refractory gMG (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nNeuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder \nSoliris has not been evaluated in paediatric patients with NMOSD. \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Soliris in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of NMOSD (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nPharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism \n \nBiotransformation \nHuman antibodies undergo endocytotic digestion in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. \nEculizumab contains only naturally occurring amino acids and has no known active metabolites. Human \nantibodies are predominately catabolized by lysosomal enzymes to small peptides and amino acids. \n \nElimination \nNo specific studies have been performed to evaluate the hepatic, renal, lung, or gastrointestinal routes of \nexcretion/elimination for Soliris. In normal kidneys, antibodies are not excreted and are excluded from \nfiltration by their size. \n \nPharmacokinetic Parameters \nIn 40 patients with PNH, a 1-compartmental model was used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters after \nmultiple doses. Mean clearance was 0.31 \u00b1 0.12 mL/hr/kg, mean volume of distribution was 110.3 \u00b1 \n17.9 mL/kg, and mean elimination half-life was 11.3 \u00b1 3.4 days. The steady state is achieved by 4 weeks \nusing the PNH adult dosing regimen. \n \nIn PNH patients, pharmacodynamic activity correlates directly with eculizumab serum concentrations and \nmaintenance of trough levels above \u2265 35 microgram/mL results in essentially complete blockade of \nhaemolytic activity in the majority of PNH patients. \n \nA second population PK analysis with a standard 1 compartmental model was conducted on the multiple \ndose PK data from 37 aHUS patients receiving the recommended Soliris regimen in studies C08-002A/B \nand C08-003A/B. In this model, the clearance of Soliris for a typical aHUS patient weighing 70 kg was \n0.0139 L/hr and the volume of distribution was 5.6 L. The elimination half-life was 297 h (approximately \n12.4 days).  \n \nThe second population PK model was applied to the multiple dose PK data from 22 paediatric aHUS \npatients receiving the recommended Soliris regimen in aHUS C10-003. The clearance and volume of \ndistribution of Soliris are weight dependent, which forms the basis for a weight categorical based dose \nregimen in paediatric patients (see section 4.2). Clearance values of Soliris in paediatric aHUS patients \nwere 10.4, 5.3, and 2.2 mL/hr with body weight of 70, 30, and 10 kg, respectively; and the corresponding \nvolume of distribution values were 5.23, 2.76, and 1.21 L, respectively. The corresponding elimination \nhalf-life remained almost unchanged within a range of 349 to 378 h (approximately 14.5 to 15.8 days). \n \nThe clearance and half-life of eculizumab were also evaluated during plasma exchange interventions.  \nPlasma exchange resulted in an approximately 50% decline in eculizumab concentrations following a \n1 hour intervention and the elimination half-life of eculizumab was reduced to 1.3 hours. Supplemental \ndosing is recommended when Soliris is administered to aHUS patients receiving plasma infusion or \nexchange (see section 4.2). \n \nAll aHUS patients treated with Soliris when administered as recommended demonstrated rapid and \nsustained reduction in terminal complement activity. In aHUS patients, pharmacodynamic activity \ncorrelates directly with eculizumab serum concentrations and maintenance of trough levels of \napproximately 50-100 microgram/ml results in essentially complete blockade of terminal complement \nactivity in all aHUS patients.  \n \nPK parameters are consistent across PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and NMOSD patient populations.  \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPharmacodynamic activity measured by free C5 concentrations of <0.5 ug/mL, is correlated with \nessentially complete blockade of terminal complement activity in PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG and \nNMOSD patients.  \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nDedicated studies have not been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Soliris in special patient \npopulations identified by gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  \nPopulation PK analysis on data collected across studies in PNH, aHUS, gMG and NMOSD patients \nshowed that gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.function do not \ninfluence the PK of eculizumab. Body weight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab \nclearance in pediatric patients requiring body weight based dosing in pediatric patients.  \n \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eculizumab was evaluated in Study M07-005 in PNH paediatric patients (aged \nfrom 11 to less than 18 years) and in Studies C08-002, C08-003, C09-001r and C10-003 in aHUS \npediatric patients (aged 2 months to less than 18 years) with body-weight based dose regimen.  \n\nWeight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab clearance 0.0105 L/h in the adolescent \nPNH patients. Dosing for paediatric patients <40 kg is based on paediatric patients with aHUS. \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe specificity of eculizumab for C5 in human serum was evaluated in two in vitro studies.   \n \nThe tissue cross-reactivity of eculizumab was evaluated by assessing binding to a panel of 38 human \ntissues. C5 expression in the human tissue panel examined in this study is consistent with published \nreports of C5 expression, as C5 has been reported in smooth muscle, striated muscle, and renal proximal \ntubular epithelium. No unexpected tissue cross-reactivity was observed. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab due to lack of pharmacologic \nactivity in non-human species.  \n \nIn a 26 week toxicity study performed in mice with a surrogate antibody directed against murine C5, \ntreatment did not affect any of the toxicity parameters examined. Haemolytic activity during the course of \nthe study was effectively blocked in both female and male mice.  \n \nNo clear treatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in reproductive toxicology studies in \nmice with a surrogate terminal complement inhibitory antibody, which was utilized to assess the \nreproductive safety of C5 blockade. These studies included assessment of fertility and early embryonic \ndevelopment, developmental toxicity, and pre and post-natal development. \n \nWhen maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and \none case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher \nantibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human Soliris dose, based on a body \nweight comparison); however, the exposure did not increase foetal loss or neonatal death. \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of \neculizumab. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n6.

What Soliris is and what it is used for \n\n \nWhat is Soliris \nSoliris contains the active substance eculizumab and it belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal \nantibodies. Eculizumab binds to and inhibits a specific protein in the body that causes inflammation and so \nprevents your body\u2019s systems from attacking and destroying vulnerable blood cells, kidneys, muscles or \neye nerves and spinal cord. \n \nWhat is Soliris used for \nParoxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria \nSoliris is used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood system \ncalled Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH). In patients with PNH, their red blood cells can be \ndestroyed which can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, dark \nurine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab can block the body\u2019s inflammatory response, and \nits ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable PNH blood cells.  \n \nAtypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome \nSoliris is also used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood \nsystem and kidney called atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). In patients with aHUS, their \nkidney and blood cells, including platelets, can be inflamed which can lead to low blood counts \n(thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood clots, tiredness and difficulty in \nfunctioning. Eculizumab can block the body\u2019s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy \nits own vulnerable blood and kidney cells.  \n \nRefractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis \nSoliris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease affecting the muscles and called \ngeneralized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG). In patients with gMG, their muscles can be attacked and damaged \nby the immune system which can lead to profound muscle weakness, impaired mobility, shortness of \nbreath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired activities of daily living. Soliris can \n\n\n\n48 \n\nblock the body\u2019s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own muscles to improve \nmuscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and impact of the disease on the activities \nof daily living. Soliris is specifically indicated for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment \nwith other existing MG therapies. \n \nNeuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders \nSoliris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease that predominantly affects the eye \nnerves and the spinal cord called Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD). In patients with \nNMOSD, their eye nerve and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by the immune system which can lead \nto blindness in one or both eyes, weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of \nsensation, and markedly impaired activities of daily living. Soliris can block the body\u2019s inflammatory \nresponse, and its ability to attack and destroy its own eye nerves and spinal cord, thereby reducing \nsymptoms of the disease and impact of the disease on the activities of daily living. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Soliris \n\n \nDo not use Soliris \n \n- If you are allergic to eculizumab, proteins derived from mouse products, other monoclonal \n\nantibodies, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless you take antibiotics to \n\nreduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated . \n- If you have a meningococcal infection. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nMeningococcal and other Neisseria infections alert \nSoliris treatment may reduce your natural resistance to infections, especially against certain organisms that \ncause meningococcal infection (severe infection of the linings of the brain and sepsis) and other Neisseria \ninfections including disseminated gonorrhea. \n \nConsult your doctor before you take Soliris to be sure that you receive vaccination against Neisseria \nmeningitidis, an organism that causes meningococcal infection, at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy, \nor that you take antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. \nEnsure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should also be aware that \nvaccination may not prevent this type of infection. In accordance with national recommendations, your \ndoctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to prevent infection. \n \nIf you are at risk of gonorrhoea, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nMeningococcal infection symptoms \nBecause of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating certain types of infection in patients who \nreceive Soliris, you will be provided a card to carry with you, listing specific trigger symptoms. This card \nis named: \u201cPatient Safety Card\u201d. \n \nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:    \n- headache with nausea or vomiting \n- headache with a stiff neck or back \n- fever \n- rash  \n- confusion  \n- severe muscle aches combined with flu-like symptoms \n\n\n\n49 \n\n- sensitivity to light \n \nTreatment for meningococcal infection while travelling \nIf you are travelling in a remote region where you are unable to contact your doctor or in which you find \nyourself temporarily unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor can make arrangements to issue, as \na preventive measure, a prescription for an antibiotic to counter Neisseria meningitidis that you keep with \nyou. If you experience any of the symptoms amongst those cited above, you should take the antibiotics as \nprescribed. You should bear in mind that you should see a doctor as soon as possible, even if you feel \nbetter after having taken the antibiotics. \n \nInfections \nBefore starting Soliris, inform your doctor if you have any infections. \n \nAllergic reactions \nSoliris contains a protein and proteins can cause allergic reactions in some people.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nPatients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal \ninfections \n \nOlder people \nThere are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over. \n \nOther medicines and Soliris \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nThe use of effective contraception during treatment and up to 5 months after treatment should be \nconsidered in women who are able to get pregnant.  \n \nPregnancy/ Breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\nDriving and using machines \nSoliris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nSoliris contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains 115 mg sodium per vial.

certain type of disease affecting the blood system called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (pnh). in patients with pnh, their red blood cells can be destroyed which can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. eculizumab can block the body's inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable pnh blood cells. atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome soliris is also used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood system and kidney called atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (ahus). in patients with ahus, their kidney and blood cells, including platelets, can be inflamed which can lead to low blood counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood clots, tiredness and difficulty in functioning. eculizumab can block the body's inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood and kidney cells. refractory generalized myasthenia gravis soliris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease affecting the muscles and called generalized myasthenia gravis (gmg). in patients with gmg, their muscles can be attacked and damaged by the immune system which can lead to profound muscle weakness, impaired mobility, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired activities of daily living. soliris can 48 block the body's inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own muscles to improve muscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and impact of the disease on the activities of daily living. soliris is specifically indicated for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with other existing mg therapies. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders soliris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease that predominantly affects the eye nerves and the spinal cord called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd). in patients with nmosd, their eye nerve and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by the immune system which can lead to blindness in one or both eyes, weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of sensation, and markedly impaired activities of daily living. soliris can block the body's inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own eye nerves and spinal cord, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and impact of the disease on the activities of daily living.",
