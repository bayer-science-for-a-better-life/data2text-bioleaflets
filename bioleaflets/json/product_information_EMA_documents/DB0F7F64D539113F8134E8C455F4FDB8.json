This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDescovy 200 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 10 mg \nof tenofovir alafenamide. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nGrey, rectangular-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 12.5 mm x 6.4 mm debossed with “GSI” \non one side and “210” on the other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDescovy is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of adults and \nadolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg) infected with human \nimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg \nDescovy should be administered as shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Dose of Descovy according to third agent in the HIV treatment regimen \n \n\nDose of Descovy Third agent in HIV treatment regimen \n(see section 4.5) \n\nDescovy 200/10 mg once \ndaily \n\nAtazanavir with ritonavir or cobicistat \nDarunavir with ritonavir or cobicistat1 \nLopinavir with ritonavir \n\nDescovy 200/25 mg once \ndaily \n\nDolutegravir, efavirenz, maraviroc, \nnevirapine, rilpivirine, raltegravir \n\n1 Descovy 200/10 mg in combination with darunavir 800 mg and cobicistat 150 mg, administered as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet, was studied in treatment-naive subjects, see section 5.1. \n\n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Descovy within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Descovy as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses a \ndose of Descovy by more than 18 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply \nresume the usual dosing schedule. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Descovy another tablet should be taken. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in adults or adolescents (aged at least 12 years and of at \nleast 35 kg body weight) with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min. Descovy should be \ndiscontinued in patients with estimated CrCl that declines below 30 mL/min during treatment (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in adults with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis; however, Descovy should generally be avoided but \nmay be used in these patients if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  On days of haemodialysis, Descovy should be administered after \ncompletion of haemodialysis treatment. \n \nDescovy should be avoided in patients with estimated CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min, or \n< 15 mL/min who are not on chronic haemodialysis, as the safety of Descovy has not been established \nin these populations. \n \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations in children less than 18 years with end stage \nrenal disease. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in patients with hepatic impairment.   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Descovy in children younger than 12 years of age, or weighing < 35 kg, \nhave not yet been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nDescovy should be taken orally, once daily with or without food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated \ntablet should not be chewed, crushed, or split. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Descovy in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) \nhave not been established. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Discontinuation of Descovy therapy \nin patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of \nhepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue Descovy should be closely \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nmonitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping \ntreatment. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Descovy in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not \nbeen established (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis \njirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable, and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nPatients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations \n \nDescovy should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R \nmutation (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTriple nucleoside therapy \n \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as with \nlamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen.  Therefore, the same problems may be seen if \nDescovy is administered with a third nucleoside analogue. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients receiving Descovy or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and, therefore, should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \n \nPatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \n \nDescovy should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease \n(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the \npotential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination \nwith elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected adults \nwith end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was \nmaintained through 48 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with \nnormal renal function.  Although there were no new safety issues identified, the implications of \nincreased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nThe co-administration of Descovy is not recommended with certain anticonvulsants (e.g., \ncarbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin), antimycobacterials (e.g., rifampicin, \nrifabutin, rifapentine), St. John’s wort and HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) other than atazanavir, \nlopinavir and darunavir (see section 4.5). \n \nDescovy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nDescovy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nEmtricitabine \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP).  Medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in \ntenofovir alafenamide absorption.  Medicinal products that induce P-gp activity (e.g., rifampicin, \nrifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir \nalafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to \nloss of therapeutic effect of Descovy and development of resistance.  Co-administration of Descovy \nwith other medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP activity (e.g., cobicistat, ritonavir, \nciclosporin) is expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide.  \nBased on data from an in vitro study, co-administration of tenofovir alafenamide and xanthine oxidase \ninhibitors (e.g., febuxostat) is not expected to increase systemic exposure to tenofovir in vivo. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6 in vitro.  It is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo.  Tenofovir alafenamide is a \nsubstrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro.  The distribution of tenofovir alafenamide in the body \nmay be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. \n \nOther interactions \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT) 1A1 in vitro.  It is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is an inhibitor of other \nUGT enzymes.

However, a large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 exposed \noutcomes) indicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of emtricitabine with respect to \nfertility parameters, pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.  Studies of \ntenofovir alafenamide in animals have shown no evidence of harmful effects on fertility parameters, \npregnancy, or foetal development (see section 5.3). \n \nDescovy should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is excreted in human milk.  Emtricitabine is excreted in \nhuman milk.  In animal studies it has been shown that tenofovir is excreted in milk. \n \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants.  \nTherefore, Descovy should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on fertility from the use of Descovy in humans.  In animal studies there were no \neffects of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide on mating or fertility parameters (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with Descovy. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which \n3,112 HIV-1 infected patients received medicinal products containing emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide and from post-marketing experience.  In clinical studies of 866 treatment-naïve adult \npatients receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide with elvitegravir and cobicistat as the fixed-\ndose combination tablet elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir \nalafenamide (as fumarate) 10 mg (E/C/F/TAF) through 144 weeks, the most frequently reported \nadverse reactions were diarrhoea (7%), nausea (11%), and headache (6%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 3 are listed by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are \ndefined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100). \n \nTable 3: Tabulated list of adverse reactions1 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: anaemia2 \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: abnormal dreams \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: headache, dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: nausea \nCommon: diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence \nUncommon: dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Rash \nUncommon: angioedema3, 4, pruritus, urticaria4 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: arthralgia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \n1 With the exception of angioedema, anaemia and urticaria (see footnotes 2,3 and 4), all adverse reactions were identified \n\nfrom clinical studies of F/TAF containing products.  The frequencies were derived from Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF clinical \nstudies in 866 treatment-naïve adult patients through 144 weeks of treatment (GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111). \n\n2 This adverse reaction was not observed in the clinical studies of F/TAF-containing products but identified from clinical \nstudies or post-marketing experience for emtricitabine when used with other antiretrovirals. \n\n3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for emtricitabine-containing products.  \n4     This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable, and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nChanges in lipid laboratory tests \nIn studies in treatment-naïve patients, increases from baseline were observed in both the tenofovir \nalafenamide fumarate and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate containing treatment groups for the fasting \nlipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144.  The median increase from baseline for those \nparameters was greater in the E/C/F/TAF group compared with the elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat \n150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (E/C/F/TDF) group at \nWeek 144 (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct \nLDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides).  The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in total \ncholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio at Week 144 was 0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) in the E/C/F/TAF group and 0.1 \n(-0.4, 0.6) in the E/C/F/TDF group (p = 0.006 for the difference between treatment groups). \n \nIn a study of virologically suppressed patients switching from emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate to Descovy while maintaining the third antiretroviral agent (Study GS-US-311-1089), \nincreases from baseline were observed in the fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct LDL \ncholesterol and triglycerides in the Descovy arm compared with little change in the \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disproxil fumarate arm (p ≤ 0.009 for the difference between groups in \nchanges from baseline).  There was little change from baseline in median fasting values for HDL \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\ncholesterol and glucose, or in the fasting total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio in either treatment \narm at Week 96.  None of the changes was considered clinically relevant. \n \nIn a study of virologically suppressed adult patients switching from abacavir/lamivudine to Descovy \nwhile maintaining the third antiretroviral agent (Study GS-US-311-1717), there were minimal changes \nin lipid parameters.  \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 48 weeks in an open-\nlabel clinical study (GS-US-292-0106) in which HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve paediatric patients \naged 12 to < 18 years received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  The safety profile of emtricitabine and \ntenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir and cobicistat in 50 adolescent patients was similar to \nthat in adults (see section 5.1). \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 144 weeks in an open-\nlabel clinical study (GS-US-292-0112) in which 248 HIV-1 infected patients who were either \ntreatment-naïve (n = 6) or virologically suppressed (n = 242) with mild to moderate renal impairment \n(estimated glomerular filtration rate by Cockcroft-Gault method [eGFRCG]: 30-69 mL/min) received \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  The safety profile in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment was similar \nto that in patients with normal renal function (see section 5.1). \n \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 48 weeks in a single arm, \nopen-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1825) in which 55 virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected \npatients with end stage renal disease (eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis received \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  There were no new safety issues identified in patients with end stage renal disease \non chronic haemodialysis receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, in combination with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat \nas a fixed-dose combination tablet (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide \n[E/C/F/TAF]) was evaluated in 72 HIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving treatment for HIV in an \nopen-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1249), through Week 48, in which patients were switched from \nanother antiretroviral regimen (which included tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] in 69 of 72 \npatients) to E/C/F/TAF.  Based on these limited data, the safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet, in \npatients with HIV/HBV co-infection, was similar to that in patients with HIV-1 monoinfection (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment \nof overdose with Descovy consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs \nas well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nEmtricitabine can be removed by haemodialysis, which removes approximately 30% of the \nemtricitabine dose over a 3 hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing.  \nTenofovir is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately \n54%.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations.  ATC code: J05AR17. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and nucleoside analogue of \n2’-deoxycytidine.  Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine \ntriphosphate.  Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), which results in DNA chain-\ntermination.  Emtricitabine has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and phosphonamidate \nprodrug of tenofovir (2’-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).  Tenofovir alafenamide is \npermeable into cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through \nhydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \nin concentrating tenofovir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or HIV target cells \nincluding lymphocytes and macrophages.  Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the \npharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits \nHIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA chain-\ntermination. \n \nTenofovir has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity in cell culture. \nNo antagonism was observed with emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide when combined with other \nantiretroviral agents. \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs.  The 50% effective concentration \n(EC50) values for emtricitabine were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 μM.  Emtricitabine displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from \n0.007 to 0.075 μM) and showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 \nto 1.5 μM). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of \nHIV-1 subtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage \ncells and CD4+-T lymphocytes.  The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to \n14.7 nM.  Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n(M, N, and O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) \nand showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM). \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro \nReduced susceptibility to emtricitabine is associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide express a K65R mutation in \nHIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been transiently observed. \n \nIn treatment-naïve patients \nIn a pooled analysis of antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide \n(10 mg) given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet in Phase 3 studies \nGS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all \npatients with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at confirmed virological failure, at Week 144, or at the \ntime of early study drug discontinuation.  Through Week 144, the development of one or more \nprimary emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, or elvitegravir resistance-associated mutations was \nobserved in HIV-1 isolates from 12 of 22 patients with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline \nand E/C/F/TAF treatment-failure isolates (12 of 866 patients [1.4%]) compared with 12 of \n20 treatment-failure isolates from patients with evaluable genotypic data in the E/C/F/TDF group (12 \nof 867 patients [1.4%]).  In the E/C/F/TAF group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 11) \nand K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), Q148Q/R (n = 1), and N155H \n(n = 2) in integrase.  Of the HIV-1 isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in the \nE/C/F/TDF group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 9), K65R/N (n = 4), and L210W (n \n= 1) in RT and E92Q/V (n = 4) and Q148R (n = 2), and N155H/S (n=3) in integrase.  Most \nHIV-1 isolates from patients in both treatment groups who developed resistance mutations to \nelvitegravir in integrase also developed resistance mutations to emtricitabine in RT. \n \nIn patients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nIn a clinical study of HIV virologically suppressed patients co-infected with chronic hepatitis B, who \nreceived emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a \nfixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF), for 48 weeks (GS-US-292-1249, n = 72), 2 patients \nqualified for resistance analysis.  In these 2 patients, no amino acid substitutions associated with \nresistance to any of the components of E/C/F/TAF were identified in HIV-1 or HBV. \n \nCross-resistance in HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve or virologically suppressed patients \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. \n \nThe K65R and K70E mutations result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine. \n \nMultinucleoside-resistant HIV-1 with a T69S double insertion mutation or with a Q151M mutation \ncomplex including K65R showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nClinical data \n \nThere are no efficacy and safety studies conducted in treatment-naïve patients with Descovy. \n \nClinical efficacy of Descovy was established from studies conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide when given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as the fixed-dose combination tablet \nE/C/F/TAF. \n \nHIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve patients \nIn studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive \neither emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg (n = 866) once daily or emtricitabine \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (n = 867) once daily, both given with elvitegravir \n150 mg + cobicistat 150 mg as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  The mean age was 36 years (range: \n18-76), 85% were male, 57% were White, 25% were Black, and 10% were Asian.  Nineteen percent of \npatients were identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was \n4.5 log10 copies/mL (range: 1.3-7.0) and 23% had baseline viral loads > 100,000 copies/mL.  The \nmean baseline CD4+ cell count was 427 cells/mm3 (range: 0-1,360) and 13% had a CD4+ cell count \n< 200 cells/mm3. \n \nE/C/F/TAF demonstrated statistical superiority in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when \ncompared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144.

The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was -2 cells/mm3.  \nNinety-two percent (66/72 patients) had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL using missing = failure analysis at \nWeek 48.  Of the 62 patients who were HBV suppressed at baseline, 59 remained suppressed and \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n3 had missing data. Of the 10 patients who were not HBV suppressed at baseline \n(HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL), 7 became suppressed, 2 remained detectable, and 1 had missing data. \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of E/C/F/TAF in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are \ntreatment-naïve. \n \nChanges in measures of bone mineral density \nIn studies in treatment-naïve patients, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir \nand cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was associated with smaller reductions in bone \nmineral density (BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF through 144 weeks of treatment as measured by dual \nenergy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis of hip (mean change: −0.8% vs −3.4%, p < 0.001) and \nlumbar spine (mean change: −0.9% vs −3.0%, p < 0.001). In a separate study, emtricitabine and \ntenofovir alafenamide given with  darunavir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was also \nassociated with smaller reductions in BMD (as measured by hip and lumbar spine DXA analysis) \nthrough 48 weeks of treatment compared to darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate.   \n \nIn a study in virologically suppressed adult patients, improvements in BMD were noted through \n96 weeks after switching to Descovy from a TDF containing regimen compared to minimal changes \nwith maintaining the TDF containing regimen as measured by DXA analysis of hip (mean change \nfrom baseline of 1.9% vs -0.3%, p < 0.001) and lumbar spine (mean change from baseline of 2.2% vs \n-0.2%, p < 0.001). \n \nIn a study in virologically suppressed adult patients, BMD did not change significantly through 48 \nweeks after switching to Descovy from an abacavir/lamivudine containing regimen compared to \nmaintaining the abacavir/lamivudine containing regimen as measured by DXA analysis of hip (mean \nchange from baseline of 0.3% vs 0.2%, p = 0.55) and lumbar spine (mean change from baseline of \n0.1% vs < 0.1%, p = 0.78). \n \nChanges in measures of renal function \nIn studies in treatment-naïve patients, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir \nand cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet through 144 weeks was associated with a lower \nimpact on renal safety parameters (as measured after 144 weeks treatment by eGFRCG and urine \nprotein to creatinine ratio and after 96 weeks treatment by urine albumin to creatinine ratio) compared \nto E/C/F/TDF. Through 144 weeks of treatment, no subject discontinued E/C/F/TAF due to a \ntreatment-emergent renal adverse event compared with 12 subjects who discontinued E/C/F/TDF \n(p < 0.001).  \n \nIn a separate study in treatment-naïve patients, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with \ndarunavir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was associated with a lower impact on \nrenal safety parameters through 48 weeks of treatment compared to darunavir and cobicistat given \nwith emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see also section 4.4).  \n \nIn a study in virologically suppressed adult patients measures of tubular proteinuria were similar in \npatients switching to a regimen containing Descovy compared to patients who stayed on an \nabacavir/lamivudine containing regimen at baseline. At Week 48, the median percentage change in \nurine retinol binding protein to creatinine ratio was 4% in the Descovy group and 16% in those \nremaining on an abacavir/lamivudine containing regimen; and in urine beta-2 microglobulin to \ncreatinine ratio it was 4% vs. 5%. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-0106, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide were evaluated in an open-label study in which 50 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve \nadolescents received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (10 mg) given with elvitegravir and \ncobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  Patients had a mean age of 15 years (range: 12-17), and \n56% were female, 12% were Asian, and 88% were Black.  At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nwas 4.7 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 456 cells/mm3 (range: 95-1,110), and median \nCD4+% was 23% (range: 7-45%).  Overall, 22% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA \n> 100,000 copies/mL.  At 48 weeks, 92% (46/50) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, similar to \nresponse rates in studies of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults.  The mean increase from baseline \nin CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 224 cells/mm3.  No emergent resistance to E/C/F/TAF was \ndetected through Week 48. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDescovy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nEmtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose.  Following multiple dose oral administration of \nemtricitabine to 20 HIV-1 infected subjects, the (mean ± SD) steady state plasma emtricitabine peak \nconcentrations (Cmax) were 1.8 ± 0.7 μg/mL and the area-under the plasma concentration-time curve \nover a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) was 10.0 ± 3.1 μg•h/mL.  The mean steady state plasma trough \nconcentration at 24 hours post-dose was equal to or greater than the mean in vitro IC90 value for \nanti-HIV-1 activity. \n \nEmtricitabine systemic exposure was unaffected when emtricitabine was administered with food. \n \nFollowing administration of food in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations were observed \napproximately 1 hour post-dose for tenofovir alafenamide administered as F/TAF (25 mg) or \nE/C/F/TAF (10 mg).  The mean Cmax and AUClast, (mean ± SD) under fed conditions following a \nsingle 25 mg dose of tenofovir alafenamide administered in Descovy were 0.21 ± 0.13 μg/mL and \n0.25 ± 0.11 μg•h/mL, respectively.  The mean Cmax and AUClast following a single 10 mg dose of \ntenofovir alafenamide administered in E/C/F/TAF were 0.21 ± 0.10 μg/mL and 0.25 ± 0.08 μg•h/mL, \nrespectively. \n \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of tenofovir alafenamide with a high fat meal \n(~800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in a decrease in tenofovir alafenamide Cmax (15-37%) and an increase in \nAUClast (17-77%). \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02-200 μg/mL.  At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to \nblood drug concentration ratio was ~1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio \nwas ~4.0. \n \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration \nover the range of 0.01-25 μg/mL.  Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins \nin samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that emtricitabine is not an inhibitor of human CYP enzymes.  Following \nadministration of [14C]-emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was achieved in \nurine (~86%) and faeces (~14%).  Thirteen percent of the dose was recovered in the urine as three \nputative metabolites.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to \nform the 3’-sulfoxide diastereomers (~9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form \n2’-O-glucuronide (~4% of dose).  No other metabolites were identifiable. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target \ncells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is \nhydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active \nmetabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  In human clinical studies, a 10 mg oral dose of tenofovir \nalafenamide (given with emtricitabine and elvitegravir and cobicistat) resulted in tenofovir \ndiphosphate concentrations > 4-fold higher in PBMCs and > 90% lower concentrations of tenofovir in \nplasma as compared to a 245 mg oral dose of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) (given with \nemtricitabine and elvitegravir and cobicistat). \n \nIn vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4.  Upon co-administration \nwith the moderate CYP3A inducer probe efavirenz, tenofovir alafenamide exposure was not \nsignificantly affected.  Following administration of tenofovir alafenamide, plasma [14C]-radioactivity \nshowed a time-dependent profile with tenofovir alafenamide as the most abundant species in the initial \nfew hours and uric acid in the remaining period. \n \nElimination \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nRenal excretion of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with < 1% of the dose eliminated \nin urine.  Tenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir \nalafenamide and tenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively.  \nTenofovir is renally eliminated by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, gender, and ethnicity \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to age, gender or ethnicity have been identified \nfor emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (given with elvitegravir and cobicistat) achieved \nin 24 paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years who received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide \ngiven with elvitegravir and cobicistat in Study GS-US-292-0106 were similar to exposures achieved in \ntreatment-naïve adults (Table 7). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nTable 7: Pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in antiretroviral-naïve \nadolescents and adults \n \n\n Adolescents Adults \n FTCa TAFb TFVb FTCa TAFc TFVc \n\nAUCtau \n(ng•h/mL) \n\n14,424.4 \n(23.9) \n\n242.8 \n(57.8) \n\n275.8 \n(18.4) \n\n11,714.1 \n(16.6) \n\n206.4 \n(71.8) \n\n292.6 \n(27.4) \n\nCmax \n(ng/mL) \n\n2,265.0 \n(22.5) \n\n121.7 \n(46.2) \n\n14.6 (20.0) 2,056.3 \n(20.2) \n\n162.2 \n(51.1) \n\n15.2 \n(26.1) \n\nCtau \n(ng/mL) 102.4 (38.9)\n\nb N/A 10.0 (19.6) 95.2 (46.7) N/A 10.6 (28.5) \nE/C/F/TAF = elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate \nFTC = emtricitabine; TAF = tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; TFV = tenofovir \nN/A = not applicable \nData are presented as mean (%CV). \na n = 24 adolescents (GS-US-292-0106); n = 19 adults (GS-US-292-0102) \nb n = 23 adolescents (GS-US-292-0106, population PK analysis) \nc n = 539 (TAF) or 841 (TFV) adults (GS-US-292-0111 and GS-US-292-0104, population PK analysis) \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between healthy subjects and patients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl ≥ 15 \nmL/min and < 30 mL/min) in a Phase 1 study of tenofovir alafenamide.  In a separate Phase 1 study of \nemtricitabine alone, mean systemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (estimated CrCl < 30 mL/min) (33.7 μg•h/mL) than in subjects with normal renal function \n(11.8 μg•h/mL). The safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide has not been established in \npatients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min). \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 12 patients with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis who received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in \ncombination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in Study \nGS-US-292-1825 were significantly higher than in patients with normal renal function.  No clinically \nrelevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with \nend stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function.  \nThere were no new safety issues identified in patients with end stage renal disease on chronic \nhaemodialysis receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, in combination with elvitegravir and \ncobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (see section 4.8). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data on emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide in patients with end stage \nrenal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) not on chronic haemodialysis.  The safety of emtricitabine \nand tenofovir alafenamide has not been established in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment; \nhowever, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver \nimpairment should be limited.   \n \nClinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide or its metabolite \ntenofovir were not observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  In patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment, total plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir are \nlower than those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function.  When corrected for protein binding, \nunbound (free) plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide in severe hepatic impairment and \nnormal hepatic function are similar. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide have not been fully evaluated in \npatients co-infected with HBV and/or HCV. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development.  Emtricitabine has demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in mice \nand rats. \n \nNon-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary \ntarget organs of toxicity.  Bone toxicity was observed as reduced BMD in rats and dogs at tenofovir \nexposures at least four times greater than those expected after administration of Descovy.  A minimal \ninfiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir \nexposures of approximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after \nadministration of Descovy. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n \nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir \nalafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-\npostnatal study were conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  No special hazard for \nhumans was revealed in conventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction \nand development.  Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, \nfertility, pregnancy or foetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate reduced the viability \nindex and weight of pups in a peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDescovy is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of adults and \nadolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg) infected with human \nimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg \nDescovy should be administered as shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Dose of Descovy according to third agent in the HIV treatment regimen \n \n\nDose of Descovy Third agent in HIV treatment regimen \n(see section 4.5) \n\nDescovy 200/10 mg once \ndaily \n\nAtazanavir with ritonavir or cobicistat \nDarunavir with ritonavir or cobicistat1 \nLopinavir with ritonavir \n\nDescovy 200/25 mg once \ndaily \n\nDolutegravir, efavirenz, maraviroc, \nnevirapine, rilpivirine, raltegravir \n\n1 Descovy 200/10 mg in combination with darunavir 800 mg and cobicistat 150 mg, administered as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet, was studied in treatment- naive subjects, see section 5.1. \n\n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Descovy within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Descovy as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses a \ndose of Descovy by more than 18 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply \nresume the usual dosing schedule. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Descovy another tablet should be taken. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in adults or adolescents (aged at least 12 years and of at \nleast 35 kg body weight) with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min. Descovy should be \ndiscontinued in patients with estimated CrCl that declines below 30 mL/min during treatment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in adults with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis; however, Descovy should generally be avoided but \nmay be used in these patients if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  On days of haemodialysis, Descovy should be administered after \ncompletion of haemodialysis treatment. \n \nDescovy should be avoided in patients with estimated CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min, or \n< 15 mL/min who are not on chronic haemodialysis, as the safety of Descovy has not been established \nin these populations. \n \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations in children less than 18 years with end stage \nrenal disease. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Descovy is required in patients with hepatic impairment.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Descovy in children younger than 12 years of age, or weighing < 35 kg, \nhave not yet been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nDescovy should be taken orally, once daily with or without food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated \ntablet should not be chewed, crushed, or split. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Descovy in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) \nhave not been established. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Discontinuation of Descovy therapy \nin patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of \nhepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue Descovy should be closely \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nmonitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping \ntreatment. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Descovy in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not \nbeen established (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis \njirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable, and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nPatients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations \n \nDescovy should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R \nmutation (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nTriple nucleoside therapy \n \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as with \nlamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen.  Therefore, the same problems may be seen if \nDescovy is administered with a third nucleoside analogue. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients receiving Descovy or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and, therefore, should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \n \nPatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \n \nDescovy should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease \n(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the \npotential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination \nwith elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected adults \nwith end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was \nmaintained through 48 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with \nnormal renal function.  Although there were no new safety issues identified, the implications of \nincreased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nThe co-administration of Descovy is not recommended with certain anticonvulsants (e.g., \ncarbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin), antimycobacterials (e.g., rifampicin, \nrifabutin, rifapentine), St. John’s wort and HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) other than atazanavir, \nlopinavir and darunavir (see section 4.5). \n \nDescovy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nDescovy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nEmtricitabine \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP).  Medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in \ntenofovir alafenamide absorption.  Medicinal products that induce P-gp activity (e.g., rifampicin, \nrifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir \nalafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to \nloss of therapeutic effect of Descovy and development of resistance.  Co-administration of Descovy \nwith other medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP activity (e.g., cobicistat, ritonavir, \nciclosporin) is expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide.  \nBased on data from an in vitro study, co-administration of tenofovir alafenamide and xanthine oxidase \ninhibitors (e.g., febuxostat) is not expected to increase systemic exposure to tenofovir in vivo. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6 in vitro.  It is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo.  Tenofovir alafenamide is a \nsubstrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro.  The distribution of tenofovir alafenamide in the body \nmay be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. \n \nOther interactions \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT) 1A1 in vitro.  It is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is an inhibitor of other \nUGT enzymes.  Emtricitabine did not inhibit the glucuronidation reaction of a non-specific UGT \nsubstrate in vitro. \n \nInteractions between the components of Descovy and potential co-administered medicinal products are \nlisted in Table 2 (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”).  The interactions \ndescribed are based on studies conducted with Descovy, or the components of Descovy as individual \nagents and/or in combination, or are potential drug-drug interactions that may occur with Descovy. \n \nTable 2: Interactions between the individual components of Descovy and other medicinal \nproducts \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas1 \n\nEffects on medicinal product levels. \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin2 \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with Descovy \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntifungals \nKetoconazole \nItraconazole \n\nInteraction not studied with either of \nthe components of Descovy. \n \nCo-administration of ketoconazole or \nitraconazole, which are potent P-gp \ninhibitors, is expected to increase \nplasma concentrations of tenofovir \nalafenamide. \n\nThe recommended dose of Descovy \nis 200/10 mg once daily. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas1 \n\nEffects on medicinal product levels. \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin2 \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with Descovy \n\nFluconazole \nIsavuconazole \n\nInteraction not studied with either of \nthe components of Descovy. \n \nCo-administration of fluconazole or \nisavuconazole may increase plasma \nconcentrations of tenofovir \nalafenamide. \n\nDose Descovy according to the \nconcomitant antiretroviral (see \nsection 4.2). \n\nAntimycobacterials \nRifabutin \nRifampicin \nRifapentine \n\nInteraction not studied with either of \nthe components of Descovy. \n \nCo-administration of rifampicin, \nrifabutin, and rifapentine, all of which \nare P-gp inducers, may decrease \ntenofovir alafenamide plasma \nconcentrations, which may result in \nloss of therapeutic effect and \ndevelopment of resistance. \n\nCo-administration of Descovy and \nrifabutin rifampicin, or rifapentine \nis not recommended. \n\nAnti-hepatitis C virus medicinal products \nLedipasvir (90 mg once daily)/ \nsofosbuvir (400 mg once daily), \nemtricitabine (200 mg once \ndaily)/ tenofovir alafenamide \n(10 mg once daily)3 \n\nLedipasvir: \nAUC: ↑ 79% \nCmax: ↑ 65% \nCmin: ↑ 93% \n \nSofosbuvir: \nAUC: ↑ 47% \nCmax: ↑ 29% \n \nSofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007: \nAUC: ↑ 48% \nCmax: ↔ \nCmin: ↑ 66% \n \nEmtricitabine: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \nCmin: ↔ \n \nTenofovir alafenamide: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n\nNo dose adjustment of ledipasvir or \nsofosbuvir is required.

However, a large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 exposed \noutcomes) indicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of emtricitabine with respect to \nfertility parameters, pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.  Studies of \ntenofovir alafenamide in animals have shown no evidence of harmful effects on fertility parameters, \npregnancy, or foetal development (see section 5.3). \n \nDescovy should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to  \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is excreted in human milk.  Emtricitabine is excreted in \nhuman milk.  In animal studies it has been shown that tenofovir is excreted in milk. \n \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants.  \nTherefore, Descovy should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on fertility from the use of Descovy in humans.  In animal studies there were no \neffects of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide on mating or fertility parameters (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with Descovy. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which \n3,112 HIV-1 infected patients received medicinal products containing emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide and from post-marketing experience.  In clinical studies of 866 treatment-naïve adult \npatients receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide with elvitegravir and cobicistat as the fixed-\ndose combination tablet elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir \nalafenamide (as fumarate) 10 mg (E/C/F/TAF) through 144 weeks, the most frequently reported \nadverse reactions were diarrhoea (7%), nausea (11%), and headache (6%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 3 are listed by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are \ndefined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100). \n \nTable 3: Tabulated list of adverse reactions1 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: anaemia2 \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: abnormal dreams \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: headache, dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: nausea \nCommon: diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence \nUncommon: dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: rash \nUncommon: angioedema3,4, pruritus, urticaria4 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: arthralgia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \n1 With the exception of angioedema, anaemia and urticaria (see footnotes 2, 3 and 4), all adverse reactions were identified \n\nfrom clinical studies of F/TAF containing products.  The frequencies were derived from Phase 3 E/C/F/TAF clinical \nstudies in 866 treatment-naïve adult patients through 144 weeks of treatment (GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111). \n\n2 This adverse reaction was not observed in the clinical studies of F/TAF-containing products but identified from clinical \nstudies or post-marketing experience for emtricitabine when used with other antiretrovirals. \n\n3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for emtricitabine-containing products.  \n4       This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable, and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nChanges in lipid laboratory tests \nIn studies in treatment- naïve patients, increases from baseline were observed in both the tenofovir \nalafenamide fumarate and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate containing treatment groups for the fasting \nlipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144.  The median increase from baseline for those \nparameters was greater in the E/C/F/TAF group compared with the elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat \n150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (E/C/F/TDF) group at \nWeek 144 (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct \nLDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides).  The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in total \ncholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio at Week 144 was 0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) in the E/C/F/TAF group and 0.1 \n(-0.4, 0.6) in the E/C/F/TDF group (p = 0.006 for the difference between treatment groups). \n \nIn a study of virologically suppressed patients switching from emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate to Descovy while maintaining the third antiretroviral agent (Study GS-US-311-1089), \nincreases from baseline were observed in the fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct LDL \ncholesterol and triglycerides in the Descovy arm compared with little change in the \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disproxil fumarate arm (p ≤ 0.009 for the difference between groups in \nchanges from baseline).  There was little change from baseline in median fasting values for HDL \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\ncholesterol and glucose, or in the fasting total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio in either treatment \narm at Week 96.  None of the changes was considered clinically relevant. \n \nIn a study of virologically suppressed adult patients switching from abacavir/lamivudine to Descovy \nwhile maintaining the third antiretroviral agent (Study GS-US-311-1717), there were minimal changes \nin lipid parameters.  \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 48 weeks in an open-\nlabel clinical study (GS-US-292-0106) in which HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve paediatric patients \naged 12 to < 18 years received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  The safety profile of emtricitabine and \ntenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir and cobicistat in 50 adolescent patients was similar to \nthat in adults (see section 5.1). \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 144 weeks in an open-\nlabel clinical study (GS-US-292-0112) in which 248 HIV-1 infected patients who were either \ntreatment-naïve (n = 6) or virologically suppressed (n = 242) with mild to moderate renal impairment \n(estimated glomerular filtration rate by Cockcroft-Gault method [eGFRCG]: 30-69 mL/min) received \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  The safety profile in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment was similar \nto that in patients with normal renal function (see section 5.1). \n \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 48 weeks in a single arm, \nopen-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1825) in which 55 virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected \npatients with end stage renal disease (eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis received \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  There were no new safety issues identified in patients with end stage renal disease \non chronic haemodialysis receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, in combination with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nThe safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat \nas a fixed-dose combination tablet (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide \n[E/C/F/TAF]) was evaluated in 72 HIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving treatment for HIV in an \nopen-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1249), through Week 48, in which patients were switched from \nanother antiretroviral regimen (which included tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] in 69 of 72 \npatients) to E/C/F/TAF.  Based on these limited data, the safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet, in \npatients with HIV/HBV co-infection, was similar to that in patients with HIV-1 monoinfection (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment \nof overdose with Descovy consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs \nas well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nEmtricitabine can be removed by haemodialysis, which removes approximately 30% of the \nemtricitabine dose over a 3 hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing.  \nTenofovir is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately \n54%.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations.  ATC code: J05AR17. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and nucleoside analogue of \n2’-deoxycytidine.  Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine \ntriphosphate.  Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), which results in DNA chain-\ntermination.  Emtricitabine has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and phosphonamidate \nprodrug of tenofovir (2’-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).  Tenofovir alafenamide is \npermeable into cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through \nhydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \nin concentrating tenofovir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or HIV target cells \nincluding lymphocytes and macrophages.  Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the \npharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits \nHIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA chain-\ntermination. \n \nTenofovir has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity in cell culture. \nNo antagonism was observed with emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide when combined with other \nantiretroviral agents. \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs.  The 50% effective concentration \n(EC50) values for emtricitabine were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 μM.  Emtricitabine displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from \n0.007 to 0.075 μM) and showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 \nto 1.5 μM). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of \nHIV-1 subtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage \ncells and CD4+-T lymphocytes.  The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to \n14.7 nM.  Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n(M, N, and O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) \nand showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM). \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro \nReduced susceptibility to emtricitabine is associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide express a K65R mutation in \nHIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been transiently observed. \n \nIn treatment-naïve patients \nIn a pooled analysis of antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide \n(10 mg) given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet in Phase 3 studies \nGS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all \npatients with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at confirmed virological failure, at Week 144, or at the \ntime of early study drug discontinuation.  Through Week 144, the development of one or more \nprimary emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, or elvitegravir resistance-associated mutations was \nobserved in HIV-1 isolates from 12 of 22 patients with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline \nand E/C/F/TAF treatment-failure isolates (12 of 866 patients [1.4%]) compared with 12 of \n20 treatment-failure isolates from patients with evaluable genotypic data in the E/C/F/TDF group (12 \nof 867 patients [1.4%]).  In the E/C/F/TAF group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 11) \nand K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), Q148Q/R (n = 1), and N155H \n(n = 2) in integrase.  Of the HIV-1 isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in the \nE/C/F/TDF group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 9), K65R/N (n = 4), and L210W (n \n= 1) in RT and E92Q/V (n = 4) and Q148R (n = 2), and N155H/S (n=3) in integrase.  Most \nHIV-1 isolates from patients in both treatment groups who developed resistance mutations to \nelvitegravir in integrase also developed resistance mutations to emtricitabine in RT. \n \nIn patients co-infected with HIV and HBV  \nIn a clinical study of HIV virologically suppressed patients co-infected with chronic hepatitis B, who \nreceived emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a \nfixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF), for 48 weeks (GS-US-292-1249, n = 72), 2 patients \nqualified for resistance analysis.  In these 2 patients, no amino acid substitutions associated with \nresistance to any of the components of E/C/F/TAF were identified in HIV-1 or HBV. \n \nCross-resistance in HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve or virologically suppressed patients \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. \n \nThe K65R and K70E mutations result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine. \n \nMultinucleoside-resistant HIV-1 with a T69S double insertion mutation or with a Q151M mutation \ncomplex including K65R showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nClinical data \n \nThere are no efficacy and safety studies conducted in treatment-naïve patients with Descovy. \n \nClinical efficacy of Descovy was established from studies conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide when given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as the fixed-dose combination tablet \nE/C/F/TAF. \n \nHIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve patients \nIn studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive \neither emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg (n = 866) once daily or emtricitabine \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (n = 867) once daily, both given with elvitegravir \n150 mg + cobicistat 150 mg as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  The mean age was 36 years (range: \n18-76), 85% were male, 57% were White, 25% were Black, and 10% were Asian.  Nineteen percent of \npatients were identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was \n4.5 log10 copies/mL (range: 1.3-7.0) and 23% had baseline viral loads > 100,000 copies/mL.  The \nmean baseline CD4+ cell count was 427 cells/mm3 (range: 0-1,360) and 13% had a CD4+ cell count \n< 200 cells/mm3. \n \nE/C/F/TAF demonstrated statistical superiority in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when \ncompared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144.  The difference in percentage was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to \n7.8%).

At Week 48, switching to a \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nDescovy-containing regimen was non-inferior to staying on a baseline abacavir/lamivudine-containing \nregimen in maintaining HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL  \n \nHIV-1 infected patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \nIn Study GS-US-292-0112, the efficacy and safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide were \nevaluated in an open-label clinical study in which 242 HIV-1 infected patients with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment (eGFRCG: 30-69 mL/min) were switched to emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide \n(10 mg) given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  Patients were \nvirologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months before switching. \n \nThe mean age was 58 years (range: 24-82), with 63 patients (26%) who were ≥ 65 years of age.  \nSeventy-nine percent were male, 63% were White, 18% were Black, and 14% were Asian.  Thirteen \npercent of patients were identified as Hispanic/Latino.  At baseline, median eGFR was 56 mL/min, \nand 33% of patients had an eGFR from 30 to 49 mL/min.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was \n664 cells/mm3 (range: 126-1,813). \n \nAt Week 144, 83.1% (197/237 patients) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet. \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-1825, the efficacy and safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, given \nwith elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet were evaluated in a single arm, \nopen-label clinical study in which 55 HIV-1 infected adults with end stage renal disease \n(eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis for at least 6 months before switching to \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  Patients were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least \n6 months before switching. \n \nThe mean age was 48 years (range 23-64).  Seventy-six percent were male, 82% were Black and 18% \nwere White.  Fifteen percent of patients identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell \ncount was 545 cells/mm3 (range 205-1473).  At Week 48, 81.8% (45/55 patients) maintained HIV-1 \nRNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, given with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  There were no clinically significant \nchanges in fasting lipid laboratory tests in patients who switched. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nIn open-label Study GS-US-292-1249, the efficacy and safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide, given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF), \nwere evaluated in adult patients co-infected with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B.  Sixty-nine of the \n72 patients were on prior TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy.  At the start of treatment with \nE/C/F/TAF, the 72 patients had been HIV-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least \n6 months with or without suppression of HBV DNA and had compensated liver function.  The mean \nage was 50 years (range 28-67), 92% of patients were male, 69% were White, 18% were Black, and \n10% were Asian.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 636 cells/mm3 (range 263-1498).  \nEighty-six percent of patients (62/72) were HBV suppressed (HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL) and 42% \n(30/72) were HBeAg positive at baseline. \n \nOf the patients who were HBeAg positive at baseline, 1/30 (3.3%) achieved seroconversion to \nanti-HBe at Week 48.  Of the patients who were HBsAg positive at baseline, 3/70 (4.3%) achieved \nseroconversion to anti-HBs Week 48. \n \nAt Week 48, 92% of patients (66/72) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to \nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, given with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was -2 cells/mm3.  \nNinety-two percent (66/72 patients) had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL using missing = failure analysis at \nWeek 48.  Of the 62 patients who were HBV suppressed at baseline, 59 remained suppressed and \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n3 had missing data. Of the 10 patients who were not HBV suppressed at baseline \n(HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL), 7 became suppressed, 2 remained detectable, and 1 had missing data. \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of E/C/F/TAF in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are \ntreatment-naïve. \n \nChanges in measures of bone mineral density \nIn studies in treatment-naïve patients, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir \nand cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was associated with smaller reductions in bone \nmineral density (BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF through 144 weeks of treatment as measured by dual \nenergy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis of hip (mean change: −0.8% vs −3.4%, p < 0.001) and \nlumbar spine (mean change: −0.9% vs −3.0%, p < 0.001). In a separate study, emtricitabine and \ntenofovir alafenamide given with  darunavir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was also \nassociated with smaller reductions in BMD (as measured by hip and lumbar spine DXA analysis) \nthrough 48 weeks of treatment compared to darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate.   \n \nIn a study in virologically suppressed adult patients, improvements in BMD were noted through \n96 weeks after switching to Descovy from a TDF containing regimen compared to minimal changes \nwith maintaining the TDF containing regimen as measured by DXA analysis of hip (mean change \nfrom baseline of 1.9% vs -0.3%, p < 0.001) and lumbar spine (mean change from baseline of 2.2% vs \n-0.2%, p < 0.001). \n \nIn a study in virologically suppressed adult patients, BMD did not change significantly through 48 \nweeks after switching to Descovy from an abacavir/lamivudine containing regimen compared to \nmaintaining the abacavir/lamivudine containing regimen as measured by DXA analysis of hip (mean \nchange from baseline of 0.3% vs 0.2%, p = 0.55) and lumbar spine (mean change from baseline of \n0.1% vs < 0.1%, p = 0.78). \n \nChanges in measures of renal function \nIn studies in treatment-naïve patients, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir \nand cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet through 144 weeks was associated with a lower \nimpact on renal safety parameters (as measured after 144 weeks treatment by eGFRCG and urine \nprotein to creatinine ratio and after 96 weeks treatment by urine albumin to creatinine ratio) compared \nto E/C/F/TDF. Through 144 weeks of treatment, no subject discontinued E/C/F/TAF due to a \ntreatment-emergent renal adverse event compared with 12 subjects who discontinued E/C/F/TDF \n(p < 0.001).  \n \nIn a separate study in treatment-naïve patients, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with \ndarunavir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet was associated with a lower impact on \nrenal safety parameters through 48 weeks of treatment compared to darunavir and cobicistat given \nwith emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see also section 4.4).  \n \nIn a study in virologically suppressed adult patients measures of tubular proteinuria were similar in \npatients switching to a regimen containing Descovy compared to patients who stayed on an \nabacavir/lamivudine containing regimen at baseline. At Week 48, the median percentage change in \nurine retinol binding protein to creatinine ratio was 4% in the Descovy group and 16% in those \nremaining on an abacavir/lamivudine containing regimen; and in urine beta-2 microglobulin to \ncreatinine ratio it was 4% vs. 5%. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-0106, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir \nalafenamide were evaluated in an open-label study in which 50 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve \nadolescents received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (10 mg) given with elvitegravir and \ncobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  Patients had a mean age of 15 years (range: 12-17), and \n56% were female, 12% were Asian, and 88% were Black.  At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nwas 4.7 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 456 cells/mm3 (range: 95-1,110), and median \nCD4+% was 23% (range: 7-45%).  Overall, 22% had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA \n> 100,000 copies/mL.  At 48 weeks, 92% (46/50) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, similar to \nresponse rates in studies of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults.  The mean increase from baseline \nin CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 224 cells/mm3.  No emergent resistance to E/C/F/TAF was \ndetected through Week 48. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDescovy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nEmtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose.  Following multiple dose oral administration of \nemtricitabine to 20 HIV-1 infected subjects, the (mean ± SD) steady state plasma emtricitabine peak \nconcentrations (Cmax) were 1.8 ± 0.7 μg/mL and the area-under the plasma concentration-time curve \nover a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) was 10.0 ± 3.1 μg•h/mL.  The mean steady state plasma trough \nconcentration at 24 hours post-dose was equal to or greater than the mean in vitro IC90 value for \nanti-HIV-1 activity. \n \nEmtricitabine systemic exposure was unaffected when emtricitabine was administered with food. \n \nFollowing administration of food in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations were observed \napproximately 1 hour post-dose for tenofovir alafenamide administered as F/TAF (25 mg) or \nE/C/F/TAF (10 mg).  The mean Cmax and AUClast, (mean ± SD) under fed conditions following a \nsingle 25 mg dose of tenofovir alafenamide administered in Descovy were 0.21 ± 0.13 μg/mL and \n0.25 ± 0.11 μg•h/mL, respectively.  The mean Cmax and AUClast following a single 10 mg dose of \ntenofovir alafenamide administered in E/C/F/TAF were 0.21 ± 0.10 μg/mL and 0.25 ± 0.08 μg•h/mL, \nrespectively. \n \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of tenofovir alafenamide with a high fat meal \n(~800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in a decrease in tenofovir alafenamide Cmax (15-37%) and an increase in \nAUClast (17-77%). \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02-200 μg/mL.  At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to \nblood drug concentration ratio was ~1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio \nwas ~4.0. \n \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration \nover the range of 0.01-25 μg/mL.  Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins \nin samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that emtricitabine is not an inhibitor of human CYP enzymes.  Following \nadministration of [14C]-emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was achieved in \nurine (~86%) and faeces (~14%).  Thirteen percent of the dose was recovered in the urine as three \nputative metabolites.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to \nform the 3’-sulfoxide diastereomers (~9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form \n2’-O-glucuronide (~4% of dose).  No other metabolites were identifiable. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target \ncells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is \nhydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active \nmetabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  In human clinical studies, a 10 mg oral dose of tenofovir \nalafenamide (given with emtricitabine and elvitegravir and cobicistat) resulted in tenofovir \ndiphosphate concentrations > 4-fold higher in PBMCs and > 90% lower concentrations of tenofovir in \nplasma as compared to a 245 mg oral dose of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) (given with \nemtricitabine and elvitegravir and cobicistat). \n \nIn vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4.  Upon co-administration \nwith the moderate CYP3A inducer probe efavirenz, tenofovir alafenamide exposure was not \nsignificantly affected.  Following administration of tenofovir alafenamide, plasma [14C]-radioactivity \nshowed a time-dependent profile with tenofovir alafenamide as the most abundant species in the initial \nfew hours and uric acid in the remaining period. \n \nElimination \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nRenal excretion of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with < 1% of the dose eliminated \nin urine.  Tenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir \nalafenamide and tenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively.  \nTenofovir is renally eliminated by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, gender, and ethnicity \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to age, gender or ethnicity have been identified \nfor emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (given with elvitegravir and cobicistat) achieved \nin 24 paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years who received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide \ngiven with elvitegravir and cobicistat in Study GS-US-292-0106 were similar to exposures achieved in \ntreatment-naïve adults (Table 7). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nTable 7: Pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in antiretroviral-naïve \nadolescents and adults \n \n\n Adolescents Adults \n FTCa TAFb TFVb FTCa TAFc TFVc \n\nAUCtau \n(ng•h/mL) \n\n14,424.4 \n(23.9) \n\n242.8 \n(57.8) \n\n275.8 \n(18.4) \n\n11,714.1 \n(16.6) \n\n206.4 \n(71.8) \n\n292.6 \n(27.4) \n\nCmax \n(ng/mL) \n\n2,265.0 \n(22.5) \n\n121.7 \n(46.2) \n\n14.6 (20.0) 2,056.3 \n(20.2) \n\n162.2 \n(51.1) \n\n15.2 \n(26.1) \n\nCtau \n(ng/mL) 102.4 (38.9)\n\nb N/A 10.0 (19.6) 95.2 (46.7) N/A 10.6 (28.5) \nE/C/F/TAF = elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate \nFTC = emtricitabine; TAF = tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; TFV = tenofovir \nN/A = not applicable \nData are presented as mean (%CV). \na n = 24 adolescents (GS-US-292-0106); n = 19 adults (GS-US-292-0102) \nb n = 23 adolescents (GS-US-292-0106, population PK analysis) \nc n = 539 (TAF) or 841 (TFV) adults (GS-US-292-0111 and GS-US-292-0104, population PK analysis) \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between healthy subjects and patients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl > 15 \nmL/min and < 30 mL/min) in a Phase 1 study of tenofovir alafenamide.  In a separate Phase 1 study of \nemtricitabine alone, mean systemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (estimated CrCl < 30 mL/min) (33.7 μg•h/mL) than in subjects with normal renal function \n(11.8 μg•h/mL). The safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide has not been established in \npatients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min). \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 12 patients with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis who received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in \ncombination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in Study \nGS-US-292-1825 were significantly higher than in patients with normal renal function.  No clinically \nrelevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with \nend stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function.  \nThere were no new safety issues in patients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \nreceiving emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a \nfixed-dose combination tablet (see section 4.8). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data on emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide in patients with end stage \nrenal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) not on chronic haemodialysis.  The safety of emtricitabine \nand tenofovir alafenamide has not been established in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment; \nhowever, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver \nimpairment should be limited.   \n \nClinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide or its metabolite \ntenofovir were not observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  In patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment, total plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir are \nlower than those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function.  When corrected for protein binding, \nunbound (free) plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide in severe hepatic impairment and \nnormal hepatic function are similar. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide have not been fully evaluated in \npatients co-infected with HBV and/or HCV. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development.  Emtricitabine has demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in mice \nand rats. \n \nNon-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary \ntarget organs of toxicity.  Bone toxicity was observed as reduced BMD in rats and dogs at tenofovir \nexposures at least four times greater than those expected after administration of Descovy.  A minimal \ninfiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir \nexposures of approximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after \nadministration of Descovy. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n \nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir \nalafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-\npostnatal study were conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  No special hazard for \nhumans was revealed in conventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction \nand development.  Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, \nfertility, pregnancy or foetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate reduced the viability \nindex and weight of pups in a peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nDescovy 200 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets \nemtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.  This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information.  You can help by reporting any side effects you may get.  See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Descovy is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Descovy \n3. How to take Descovy \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Descovy \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Descovy is and what it is used for \n \nDescovy contains two active substances: \n \n• emtricitabine, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NRTI) \n• tenofovir alafenamide, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleotide reverse \n\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) \n \nDescovy blocks the action of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for the virus to \nmultiply.  Descovy therefore reduces the amount of HIV in your body. \n \nDescovy in combination with other medicines is for the treatment of human immunodeficiency \nvirus 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least \n35 kg. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Descovy \n \nDo not take Descovy: \n• If you are allergic to emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Descovy. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Descovy you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Descovy: \n \n• If you have liver problems or have suffered liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B liver problems may become worse after you stop taking Descovy.  Do \nnot stop taking Descovy without talking to your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking \nDescovy. \n\n \n• Your doctor may not prescribe Descovy to you if the virus has a K65R mutation. \n \nWhile you are taking Descovy \n \nOnce you start taking Descovy, look out for: \n \n• Signs of inflammation or infection \n• Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems \n \n If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see \n\nsection 4, Possible side effects. \n \nAlthough kidney problems have not been observed with Descovy, there is a possibility that you may \nexperience kidney problems when taking Descovy over a long period of time. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children aged 11 years or under, or weighing less than 35 kg.  The use \nof Descovy in children aged 11 years or under has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Descovy \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Descovy may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Descovy or other \nmedicines in your blood may change.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may \nmake any side effects worse.  In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your \nblood levels. \n \nMedicines used in treating hepatitis B infection: \nYou should not take Descovy with medicines containing: \n• tenofovir alafenamide \n• tenofovir disoproxil \n• lamivudine \n• adefovir dipivoxil \n \n Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. \n \nOther types of medicine: \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n• antibiotics, used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis, containing: \n\n- rifabutin, rifampicin, and rifapentine \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n• antiviral medicines used to treat HIV: \n- emtricitabine and tipranavir \n\n• anticonvulsants, used to treat epilepsy, such as: \n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin \n\n• herbal remedies used to treat depression and anxiety containing: \n- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines.  Do not stop your treatment \n\nwithout contacting your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n• Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant and ask about the potential benefits and \n\nrisks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child. \n \nIf you have taken Descovy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and \nother diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took \nNRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side \neffects. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Descovy.  This is because one of the active substances in \nthis medicine passes into breast milk.  It is recommended that you do not breast-feed to avoid passing \nthe virus to the baby through breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDescovy can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy when taking Descovy, do not drive and do not use any \ntools or machines. \n \nDescovy contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Descovy \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n \nAdults: one tablet each day, with or without food \nAdolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day with or \nwithout food \n \nDo not chew, crush or split the tablet. \n \nAlways take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is \nfully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the \ndose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Descovy following completion of dialysis. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nIf you take more Descovy than you should \n \nIf you take more than the recommended dose of Descovy you may be at higher risk of side effects of \nthis medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can show what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Descovy \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Descovy. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n• If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Descovy, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n• If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Descovy, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Descovy, take another tablet. \n \nDo not stop taking Descovy \n \nDo not stop taking Descovy without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Descovy can seriously affect \nhow well future treatment works.  If Descovy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Descovy tablets. \n \nWhen your supply of Descovy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. \n \nIf you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is very important not to stop taking Descovy \nwithout talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after stopping \ntreatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment may lead to \nworsening of hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n \n• Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and who have had opportunistic infections in the past (infections that occur in people \nwith a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections \nmay occur soon after antiretroviral treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are \ndue to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections \nthat may have been present with no obvious symptoms. \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n• Autoimmune disorders (the immune system attacks healthy body tissue), may also occur after \nyou start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months \nafter the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: \n- muscle weakness \n- weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n- palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity \n\n If you notice the side effects described above, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects \n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• abnormal dreams \n• headache \n• dizziness \n• diarrhoea \n• vomiting \n• stomach pain \n• wind (flatulence) \n• rash \n• tiredness (fatigue) \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n• problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n• itching (pruritus) \n• hives (urticaria) \n• joint pain (arthralgia) \n \n If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n• Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Descovy \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement \n\n If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Descovy \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle after “EXP”.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture.  Keep the bottle tightly closed. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.

What Descovy is and what it is used for \n \nDescovy contains two active substances: \n \n• emtricitabine, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NRTI) \n• tenofovir alafenamide, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleotide reverse \n\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) \n \nDescovy blocks the action of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for the virus to \nmultiply.  Descovy therefore reduces the amount of HIV in your body. \n \nDescovy in combination with other medicines is for the treatment of human immunodeficiency \nvirus 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least \n35 kg. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Descovy \n \nDo not take Descovy: \n• If you are allergic to emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Descovy. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Descovy you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Descovy: \n \n• If you have liver problems or have suffered liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B liver problems may become worse after you stop taking Descovy.  Do \nnot stop taking Descovy without talking to your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking \nDescovy. \n\n \n• Your doctor may not prescribe Descovy to you if the virus has a K65R mutation. \n \nWhile you are taking Descovy \n \nOnce you start taking Descovy, look out for: \n \n• Signs of inflammation or infection \n• Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems \n \n If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see \n\nsection 4, Possible side effects. \n \nAlthough kidney problems have not been observed with Descovy, there is a possibility that you may \nexperience kidney problems when taking Descovy over a long period of time. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children aged 11 years or under, or weighing less than 35 kg.  The use \nof Descovy in children aged 11 years or under has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Descovy \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Descovy may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Descovy or other \nmedicines in your blood may change.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may \nmake any side effects worse.  In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your \nblood levels. \n \nMedicines used in treating hepatitis B infection: \nYou should not take Descovy with medicines containing: \n• tenofovir alafenamide \n• tenofovir disoproxil \n• lamivudine \n• adefovir dipivoxil \n \n Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. \n \nOther types of medicine: \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n• antibiotics, used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis, containing: \n\n- rifabutin, rifampicin, and rifapentine \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n• antiviral medicines used to treat HIV: \n- emtricitabine and tipranavir \n\n• anticonvulsants, used to treat epilepsy, such as: \n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin \n\n• herbal remedies used to treat depression and anxiety containing: \n- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines.  Do not stop your treatment \n\nwithout contacting your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n• Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant and ask about the potential benefits and \n\nrisks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child. \n \nIf you have taken Descovy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and \nother diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took \nNRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side \neffects. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Descovy.  This is because one of the active substances in \nthis medicine passes into breast milk.  It is recommended that you do not breast-feed to avoid passing \nthe virus to the baby through breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDescovy can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy when taking Descovy, do not drive and do not use any \ntools or machines. \n \nDescovy contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Descovy \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n \nAdults: one tablet each day, with or without food \nAdolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day with or \nwithout food \n \nDo not chew, crush or split the tablet. \n \nAlways take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is \nfully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the \ndose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Descovy following completion of dialysis. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\nIf you take more Descovy than you should \n \nIf you take more than the recommended dose of Descovy you may be at higher risk of side effects of \nthis medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can show what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Descovy \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Descovy. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n• If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Descovy, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n• If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Descovy, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Descovy, take another tablet. \n \nDo not stop taking Descovy \n \nDo not stop taking Descovy without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Descovy can seriously affect \nhow well future treatment works.  If Descovy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Descovy tablets. \n \nWhen your supply of Descovy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. \n \nIf you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is very important not to stop taking Descovy \nwithout talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after stopping \ntreatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment may lead to \nworsening of hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n \n• Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and who have had opportunistic infections in the past (infections that occur in people \nwith a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections \nmay occur soon after antiretroviral treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are \ndue to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections \nthat may have been present with no obvious symptoms. \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n• Autoimmune disorders (the immune system attacks healthy body tissue), may also occur after \nyou start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months \nafter the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: \n- muscle weakness \n- weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n- palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity \n\n If you notice the side effects described above, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects \n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• abnormal dreams \n• headache \n• dizziness \n• diarrhoea \n• vomiting \n• stomach pain \n• wind (flatulence) \n• rash \n• tiredness (fatigue) \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n• problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n• itching (pruritus) \n• hives (urticaria) \n• joint pain (arthralgia) \n \n If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n• Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Descovy \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement \n\n If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Descovy \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle after “EXP”.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture.  Keep the bottle tightly closed. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
