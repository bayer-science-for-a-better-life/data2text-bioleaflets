Consider effects of concomitant \n\nmedicinal products, and assess and correct electrolyte \n\nimbalance that may prolong PR interval. Monitor \n\nECG/symptoms potentially related to AV block \n\nclosely.  \n\nFirst degree AV block: \n\nSymptomatic  \n\nWithhold lorlatinib. Consider effects of concomitant \n\nmedicinal products, and assess and correct electrolyte \n\nimbalance that may prolong PR interval. Monitor \n\nECG/symptoms potentially related to AV block \n\nclosely. If symptoms resolve, resume lorlatinib at \n\n1 reduced dose level. \n\nSecond degree AV block \n\nAsymptomatic  \n\nWithhold lorlatinib. Consider effects of concomitant \n\nmedicinal products, and assess and correct electrolyte \n\nimbalance that may prolong PR interval. Monitor \n\nECG/symptoms potentially related to AV block \n\nclosely. If subsequent ECG does not show second \n\ndegree AV block, resume lorlatinib at 1 reduced dose \n\nlevel. \n\nSecond degree AV block \n\nSymptomatic  \n\nWithhold lorlatinib. Consider effects of concomitant \n\nmedicinal products, and assess and correct electrolyte \n\nimbalance that may prolong PR interval. Refer for \n\ncardiac observation and monitoring. Consider \n\npacemaker placement if symptomatic AV block \n\npersists. If symptoms and the second-degree AV block \n\nresolve or if patients revert to asymptomatic \n\nfirst-degree AV block, resume lorlatinib at 1 reduced \n\ndose level. \n\nComplete AV block \n\nWithhold lorlatinib. Consider effects of concomitant \n\nmedicinal products, and assess and correct electrolyte \n\nimbalance that may prolong PR interval. Refer for \n\ncardiac observation and monitoring. Pacemaker \n\nplacement may be indicated for severe symptoms \n\nassociated with AV block. If AV block does not \n\nresolve, placement of a permanent pacemaker may be \n\nconsidered.  \n\nIf pacemaker placed, resume lorlatinib at full dose. If \n\nno pacemaker placed, resume lorlatinib at 1 reduced \n\ndose level only when symptoms resolve, and PR \n\ninterval is less than 200 msec. \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1.

Then resume lorlatinib \n\nat 1 reduced dose level. \nAbbreviations: CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; ECG=electrocardiogram; \n\nHMG CoA=3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; NCI=National Cancer Institute; ULN=upper limit of \n\nnormal. \na Grade categories are based on NCI CTCAE classifications. \nb Lipid-lowering therapy may include: HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, or \n\nethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acids.  \n\n \nStrong cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4/5 inhibitors \n\nConcurrent use of lorlatinib with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and \n\ngrapefruit juice products may increase lorlatinib plasma concentrations. An alternative concomitant \n\nmedicinal product with less potential to inhibit CYP3A4/5 should be considered (see section 4.5). If a \n\nstrong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, the starting lorlatinib dose of 100 mg once daily \n\nshould be reduced to once daily 75 mg dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). If concurrent use of the strong \n\nCYP3A4/5 inhibitor is discontinued, lorlatinib should be resumed at the dose used prior to the \n\ninitiation of the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor and after a washout period of 3 to 5 half-lives of the strong \n\nCYP3A4/5 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \n\nDue to the limited data on this population, no dose recommendation can be made for patients aged \n\n65 years and older (see section 5.2).   \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with normal renal function and mild or moderate \n\n(CLcr: \u2265 30mL/min) renal impairment based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Information for \n\nlorlatinib use in patients with severe (CLcr: < 30 mL/min) renal impairment is very limited. Therefore, \n\nlorlatinib is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. No information is \n\navailable for lorlatinib in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, lorlatinib is \n\nnot recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lorlatinib in paediatric patients below 18 years have not been established. \n\nNo data are available.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nLorviqua is for oral use.  \n\n \n\nPatients should be encouraged to take their dose of lorlatinib at approximately the same time each day \n\nwith or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets should be swallowed whole (tablets should not be \n\nchewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing). No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or \n\notherwise not intact. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to lorlatinib or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHyperlipidaemia \n\n \n\nThe use of lorlatinib has been associated with increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides (see \n\nsection 4.8). Median time of occurrence of severe increase in serum cholesterol and triglycerides is \n\n201 days (range: 42 to 518 days) and 127 days (range: 15 to 358 days), respectively. Serum \n\ncholesterol and triglycerides should be monitored before initiation of lorlatinib; 2, 4 and 8 weeks after \n\ninitiating lorlatinib; and regularly thereafter. Initiate or increase the dose of lipid-lowering medicinal \n\nproducts, if indicated (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nCentral nervous system effects \n\n \n\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects have been observed in patients receiving lorlatinib, including \n\npsychotic effects and changes in cognitive function, mood, mental status or speech (see section 4.8). \n\nDose modification or discontinuation may be required for those patients who develop CNS effects (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nAtrioventricular block \n\n \n\nLorlatinib was studied in a population of patients that excluded those with second-degree or \n\nthird-degree AV block (unless paced) or any AV block with PR interval > 220 msec. PR interval \n\nprolongation and AV block have been reported in patients receiving lorlatinib (see section 5.2). \n\nMonitor electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiating lorlatinib and monthly thereafter, particularly in \n\npatients with predisposing conditions to the occurrence of clinically significant cardiac events. Dose \n\nmodification may be required for those patients who develop AV block (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction decrease \n\n \n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been reported in patients receiving lorlatinib \n\nwho had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. Based on the available clinical study \n\ndata, it is not possible to determine a causal relationship between effects on changes in cardiac \n\ncontractility and lorlatinib. In patients with cardiac risk factors and those with conditions that can \n\naffect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including LVEF assessment at baseline and during treatment, should \n\nbe considered. In patients who develop relevant cardiac signs/symptoms during treatment, cardiac \n\nmonitoring, including LVEF assessment, should be considered. \n\n \n\nLipase and amylase increase  \n\n \n\nElevations of lipase and/or amylase have occurred in patients receiving lorlatinib (see section 4.8). \n\nMedian time of occurrence of increase in serum lipase and amylase is 70 days (range: 7 to 696 days) \n\nand 41 days (range: 7 to 489 days), respectively. Risk of pancreatitis should be considered in patients \n\nreceiving lorlatinib due to concomitant hypertriglyceridemia and/or a potential intrinsic mechanism. \n\nPatients should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of lorlatinib treatment \n\nand regularly thereafter as clinically indicated (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis  \n\n \n\nSevere or life-threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with ILD/pneumonitis have \n\noccurred with lorlatinib (see section 4.8). Any patient who presents with worsening of respiratory \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsymptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. dyspnoea, cough and fever) should be promptly \n\nevaluated for ILD/pneumonitis. Lorlatinib should be withheld and/or permanently discontinued based \n\non severity (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interactions \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant use of lorlatinib and rifampin, a strong \n\nCYP3A4/5 inducer, was associated with increases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate \n\naminotransferase (AST) with no increase of total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (see section 4.5). \n\nConcomitant use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided, if possible, as they may also \n\nreduce lorlatinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcurrent administration of lorlatinib with CYP3A4/5 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, \n\nincluding but not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, hormonal \n\ncontraceptives, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus, should be avoided since the \n\nconcentration of these medicinal products may be reduced by lorlatinib (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nFertility and pregnancy \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with lorlatinib and for at least 14 weeks after the final dose, male patients with \n\nfemale partners of childbearing potential must use effective contraception, including a condom, and \n\nmale patients with pregnant partners must use condoms (see section 4.6). Male fertility may be \n\ncompromised during treatment with lorlatinib (see section 5.3). Men should seek advice on effective \n\nfertility preservation before treatment. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid \n\nbecoming pregnant while receiving lorlatinib. A highly effective non-hormonal method of \n\ncontraception is required for female patients during treatment with lorlatinib, because lorlatinib can \n\nrender hormonal contraceptives ineffective (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). If a hormonal method of \n\ncontraception is unavoidable, then a condom must be used in combination with the hormonal method. \n\nEffective contraception must be continued for at least 35 days after completing therapy (see \n\nsection 4.6). It is not known whether lorlatinib affects female fertility.  \n\n \n\nLactose intolerance \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \n\ngalactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \n\nmedicinal product. \n\n \n\nDietary sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25 mg or 100 mg tablet. \n\nPatients on low sodium diets should be informed that this product is essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nIn vitro data indicate that lorlatinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and uridine \n\ndiphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A4, with minor contributions from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, \n\nCYP3A5 and UGT1A3.  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nEffect of medicinal products on lorlatinib \n\n \n\nCYP3A4/5 inducers \n\n \n\nRifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5, administered at oral doses of 600 mg once daily for 12 days, \n\nreduced the mean lorlatinib area under curve (AUCinf) by 85% and Cmax by 76% of a single 100 mg \n\noral dose of lorlatinib in healthy volunteers; increases in AST and ALT were also observed. \nConcomitant administration of lorlatinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, \n\ncarbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin and St. John\u2019s wort) may decrease lorlatinib \n\nplasma concentrations. The use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer with lorlatinib is contraindicated (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). Concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided, if \n\npossible, as they may also reduce lorlatinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nCYP3A4/5 inhibitors \n\n \n\nItraconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, administered at oral doses of 200 mg once daily for \n\n5 days, increased the mean lorlatinib AUCinf by 42% and Cmax by 24% of a single 100 mg oral dose of \n\nlorlatinib in healthy volunteers. Concomitant administration of lorlatinib with strong CYP3A4/5 \n\ninhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, cobicistat, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, troleandomycin, \n\nvoriconazole, ritonavir, paritaprevir in combination with ritonavir and ombitasvir and/or dasabuvir, \n\nand ritonavir in combination with either elvitegravir, indinavir, lopinavir or tipranavir) may increase \n\nlorlatinib plasma concentrations. Grapefruit products may also increase lorlatinib plasma \n\nconcentrations and should be avoided. An alternative concomitant medicinal product with less \n\npotential to inhibit CYP3A4/5 should be considered. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be \n\nconcomitantly administered, a dose reduction of lorlatinib is recommended (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nEffect of lorlatinib on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nCYP3A4/5 substrates \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that lorlatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor as well as an inducer of \n\nCYP3A4/5. Lorlatinib 150 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUCinf and Cmax of a single oral \n\n2 mg dose of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) by 61% by 50%, respectively; hence, \n\nlorlatinib is a moderate CYP3A inducer. Thus, concurrent administration of lorlatinib with CYP3A4/5 \n\nsubstrates with narrow therapeutic indices, including but not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, hormonal contraceptives, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and \n\ntacrolimus, should be avoided since the concentration of these medicinal products may be reduced by \n\nlorlatinib (see section 4.4).  \n\n \nCYP2B6 substrates \n\n \n\nLorlatinib 100 mg once daily for 15 days decreased AUCinf and Cmax of a single oral 100 mg dose of \n\nbupropion (a combined CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 substrate) by 49.5% and 53%, respectively. Thus, \n\nlorlatinib is a weak inducer of CYP2B6, and no dose adjustment is necessary when lorlatinib is used in \n\ncombination with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by CYP2B6. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 substrates \n\n \n\nLorlatinib 100 mg once daily for 15 days decreased AUCinf and Cmax of a single oral 500 mg dose of \n\ntolbutamide (a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate) by 43% and 15%, respectively. Thus, lorlatinib is a weak \n\ninducer of CYP2C9, and no dose adjustment is required for medicinal products that are mainly \n\nmetabolised by CYP2C9. However, patients should be monitored in case of concomitant treatment \n\nwith medicinal products with narrow therapeutic indices metabolised by CYP2C9 (e.g. coumarin \n\nanticoagulants). \n\n \n\nUGT substrates \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nLorlatinib 100 mg once daily for 15 days decreased AUCinf and Cmax of a single oral 500 mg dose of \n\nacetaminophen (a UGT, SULT and CYP1A2, 2A6, 2D6, and 3A4 substrate) by 45% and 28%, \n\nrespectively. Thus, lorlatinib is a weak inducer of UGT, and no dose adjustment is required for \n\nmedicinal products that are mainly metabolised by UGT. However, patients should be monitored in \n\ncase of concomitant treatment with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic indices metabolised by \n\nUGT.  \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates \n\n \n\nLorlatinib 100 mg once daily for 15 days decreased AUCinf and Cmax of a single oral dose of 60 mg \n\nfexofenadine [a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate] by 67% and 63%, respectively. Thus, \n\nlorlatinib is a moderate inducer of P-gp. Medicinal products that are P-gp substrates with narrow \n\ntherapeutic indices (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran etexilate) should be used with caution in combination \n\nwith lorlatinib due to the likelihood of reduced plasma concentrations of these substrates. \n\n \n\nIn vitro inhibition and induction studies of other CYP enzymes \n\n \n\nIn vitro, lorlatinib has a low potential to cause drug-drug interactions by induction of CYP1A2. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies with drug transporters other than P-gp \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that lorlatinib may have the potential to inhibit BCRP (gastrointestinal tract), \n\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, MATE1 and OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Lorlatinib \n\nshould be used with caution in combination with substrates of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, \n\nMATE1 and OAT3 as clinically relevant changes in the plasma exposure of these substrates cannot be \n\nruled out.  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \n\nlorlatinib. A highly effective non-hormonal method of contraception is required for female patients \n\nduring treatment with lorlatinib, because lorlatinib can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.5). If a hormonal method of contraception is unavoidable, then a condom must be \n\nused in combination with the hormonal method. Effective contraception must be continued for at least \n\n35 days after completing therapy.  \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with lorlatinib and for at least 14 weeks after the final dose, male patients with \n\nfemale partners of childbearing potential must use effective contraception, including a condom, and \n\nmale patients with pregnant partners must use condoms. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). There are no data from the use \n\nof lorlatinib in pregnant women. Lorlatinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant \n\nwoman.  \n\n \n\nLorlatinib is not recommended during pregnancy or for women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether lorlatinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \n\nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nLorlatinib should not be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during \n\ntreatment with lorlatinib and for 7 days after the final dose.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nBased on non-clinical safety findings, male fertility may be compromised during treatment with \n\nlorlatinib (see section 5.3). It is not known whether lorlatinib affects female fertility. Men should seek \n\nadvice on effective fertility preservation before treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLorlatinib has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be \n\nexercised when driving or operating machines as patients may experience CNS effects (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were hypercholesterolaemia (84.4%), \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia (67.1%), oedema (54.6%), peripheral neuropathy (47.8%), cognitive effects \n\n(28.8%), fatigue (28.1%), weight increased (26.4%), arthralgia (24.7%), mood effects (22.7%) and \n\ndiarrhoea (22.7%).   \n\n \n\nDose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 23.4% of patients receiving lorlatinib. The most \n\ncommon adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were oedema and peripheral neuropathy. \n\nPermanent treatment discontinuation associated with adverse reactions occurred in 3.1% of patients \n\nreceiving lorlatinib. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuations were \n\ncognitive effects and psychotic effects. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 2 presents adverse reactions occurring in 295 adult patients treated with lorlatinib 100 mg once \n\ndaily with advanced NSCLC from Study A. \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are presented by system organ class and frequency categories, \n\ndefined using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \n\nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing medical seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 2.

Terms actually reported in the studies and contributing to the \n\nrelevant adverse reaction are indicated in parentheses, as listed below. \na Hypercholesterolaemia (including blood cholesterol increased, hypercholesterolaemia). \nb Hypertriglyceridaemia (including blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridaemia). \nc Mood effects (including affective disorder, affect lability, aggression, agitation, anxiety, depressed mood, \n\ndepression, euphoric mood, irritability, mania, mood altered, mood swings, personality change, stress).  \nd Psychotic effects (including auditory hallucination, hallucination, visual hallucination). \ne Cognitive effects (including events from SOC Nervous system disorders: amnesia, cognitive disorder, \n\ndementia, disturbance in attention, memory impairment, mental impairment; and also including events \n\nfrom SOC Psychiatric disorders: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, confusional state, delirium, \n\ndisorientation, reading disorder). Within these effects, terms from SOC Nervous system disorders were \n\nmore frequently reported than terms from SOC Psychiatric disorder.  \nf Peripheral neuropathy (including burning sensation, carpal tunnel syndrome, dysaesthesia, formication, gait \n\ndisturbance, hypoaesthesia, muscular weakness, neuralgia, neuropathy peripheral, neurotoxicity, \n\nparaesthesia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, peroneal nerve palsy, sensory disturbance). \ng Speech effects (dysarthria, slow speech, speech disorder). \n\n\n\n13 \n\nh Vision disorder (including diplopia, photophobia, photopsia, vision blurred, visual acuity reduced, visual \n\nimpairment, vitreous floaters). \ni Pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis). \nj Rash (including dermatitis acneiform, maculopapular rash, pruritic rash, rash). \nk Myalgia (including musculoskeletal pain, myalgia). \nl Oedema (including generalised oedema, oedema, oedema peripheral, peripheral swelling, swelling). \nm Fatigue (including asthenia, fatigue).  \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nHypercholesterolaemia/hypertriglyceridaemia \n\nAdverse reactions of increase in serum cholesterol or triglycerides were reported in 84.4% and 67.1% \n\nof patients, respectively. Of those, mild or moderate adverse reactions of hypercholesterolaemia or \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia occurred in 67.8% and 50.5% of patients, respectively (see section 4.4). The \n\nmedian time to onset for both hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia was 15 days (range: \n\n1 to 399 days). The median duration of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia was 381 and \n\n405 days, respectively. \n\n \n\nCentral nervous system effects \n\nCNS adverse reactions were primarily cognitive effects (28.8%), mood effects (22.7%), speech effects \n\n(9.8%) and psychotic effects (7.8%), and were generally mild, transient, and reversible spontaneously \n\nupon dose delay and/or dose reduction (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). The most common cognitive effect \n\nof any grade was memory impairment (11.5%), and the most common Grade 3 or 4 reactions were \n\ncognitive effect and confusional state (0.7% each). The most common mood effect of any grade was \n\nirritability (6.1%), which was also the most common Grade 3 or 4 reaction (1.0%). The most common \n\nspeech effect of any grade was dysarthria (4.1%), and the most common Grade 3 or 4 reaction was \n\nslow speech (0.3%). The most common psychotic effect of any grade was hallucination (3.7%) and the \n\nmost common Grade 3 or 4 reactions were hallucination, hallucination auditory and hallucination \n\nvisual (0.3% each). Median time to onset for cognitive, mood, speech and psychotic effects was 92, \n\n44, 42 and 23 days, respectively. Median duration of cognitive, mood, speech and psychotic effects \n\nwas 224, 83, 106 and 74 days, respectively.   \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nTreatment of overdose with the medicinal product consists of general supportive measures. Given the \n\ndose-dependent effect on PR interval, ECG monitoring is recommended. There is no antidote for \n\nlorlatinib.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-neoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE44 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nLorlatinib is a selective, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of ALK and c-ros \n\noncogene 1 (ROS1) tyrosine kinases. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\nIn non-clinical studies, lorlatinib inhibited catalytic activities of non-mutated ALK and clinically \n\nrelevant ALK mutant kinases in recombinant enzyme and cell-based assays. Lorlatinib demonstrated \n\nmarked antitumour activity in mice bearing tumour xenografts that express echinoderm \n\nmicrotubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) fusions with ALK variant 1 (v1), including ALK \n\nmutations L1196M, G1269A, G1202R, and I1171T. Two of these ALK mutants, G1202R and I1171T, \n\nare known to confer resistance to alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib. Lorlatinib was also \n\ncapable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier. Lorlatinib demonstrated activity in mice bearing \n\northotopic EML4-ALK or EML4-ALKL1196M brain tumour implants.  \n \n\nClinical efficacy  \n\nThe use of lorlatinib in the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC after treatment with at least \n\none second-generation ALK TKI was investigated in Study A, a single-arm, multicentre Phase 1/2 \n\nstudy. A total of 139 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC after treatment with at least one \n\nsecond-generation ALK TKI were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study. Patients received \n\nlorlatinib orally at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily, continuously. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 2 portion of the study was objective response rate (ORR), \n\nincluding intracranial (IC)-ORR, as per Independent Central Review (ICR) according to modified \n\nresponse evaluation criteria in solid tumours (modified RECIST version 1.1). Secondary endpoints \n\nincluded duration of response (DOR), IC-DOR, time-to-tumour response (TTR), and progression-free \n\nsurvival (PFS). \n\n \n\nPatient demographics of the 139 ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients after treatment with at least \n\none second-generation ALK TKI, were 56% female, 48% White, 38% Asian, and the median age was \n\n53 years (range: 29-83 years) with 16% of patients \u2265 65 years of age. The Eastern Cooperative \n\nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 96% patients. Brain metastases \n\nwere present at baseline in 67% of patients. Of the 139 patients, 20% received 1 prior ALK TKI, \n\nexcluding crizotinib, 47% received 2 prior ALK TKIs, and 33% received 3 or more prior ALK TKIs. \n\n \n\nThe main efficacy results for Study A are included in Tables 3 and 4. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

The ORR for Asians was 49.1% \n\n(95% CI: 35.1, 63.2) and 31.5% for non-Asians (95% CI: 21.1, 43.4). Among the 31 patients with a \n\nconfirmed IC objective tumour response and at least one measurable brain metastasis at baseline by \n\nICR, the median IC-TTR was 1.4 months (range: 1.2 to 16.2 months). The IC ORR was 54.5% for \n\nAsians (95% CI: 32.2, 75.6) and 46.4% for non-Asians (95% CI: 27.5, 66.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nlorlatinib in all subsets of the paediatric population in lung carcinoma (small cell and non-small cell \n\ncarcinoma) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. \n\nThis means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \n\nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\n \n\nAbsorption  \n\n \n\nPeak lorlatinib concentrations in plasma are rapidly reached with the median Tmax of 1.2 hours \n\nfollowing a single 100 mg dose and 2.0 hours following multiple dosing of 100 mg once daily.  \n\n \n\nAfter oral administration of lorlatinib tablets, the mean absolute bioavailability is 80.8% (90% CI: \n\n75.7, 86.2) compared to intravenous administration. \n\n \n\nAdministration of lorlatinib with a high fat, high calorie meal resulted in 5% higher exposure \n\ncompared to fasted conditions. Lorlatinib may be administered with or without food.  \n\n \n\nAt 100 mg once daily, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV]) peak plasma \n\nconcentration was 577 (42) ng/mL and the AUC24 was 5,650 (39) ng\u0387h/mL in patients with cancer. \n\nThe geometric mean (% CV) oral clearance was 17.7 (39) L/h. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro binding of lorlatinib to human plasma proteins is 66% with moderate binding to albumin or to \n\n\u03b11-acid glycoprotein.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn humans, lorlatinib undergoes oxidation and glucuronidation as the primary metabolic pathways. \n\nIn vitro data indicate that lorlatinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, with minor \n\ncontribution from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5 and UGT1A3.  \n\n \n\nIn plasma, a benzoic acid metabolite of lorlatinib resulting from the oxidative cleavage of the amide \n\nand aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib was observed as a major metabolite, accounting for 21% of the \n\ncirculating radioactivity. The oxidative cleavage metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe plasma half-life of lorlatinib after a single 100 mg dose was 23.6 hours. Following oral \n\nadministration of a 100 mg radiolabelled dose of lorlatinib, a mean 47.7% of the radioactivity was \n\nrecovered in urine and 40.9% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces, with overall mean total \n\nrecovery of 88.6%.   \n\n \n\nUnchanged lorlatinib was the major component of human plasma and faeces, accounting for 44% and \n\n9.1% of total radioactivity, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged lorlatinib was detected in urine.  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, lorlatinib is an inducer via human pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) and the human \n\nconstitutive androstane receptor (CAR).   \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nAt single dose, lorlatinib systemic exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) increased in a dose-related manner over \n\nthe 10 to 200 mg dose range. Few data are available over the 10 to 200 mg dose range; however, no \n\ndeviation from linearity was observed for AUCinf and Cmax after single dose. \n\n \n\nAfter multiple once daily dose administration, lorlatinib Cmax increased dose-proportionally and \n\nAUCtau increased slightly less than proportionally over the dose range of 10 to 200 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nAlso, at steady-state lorlatinib plasma exposures are lower than those expected from single dose \n\npharmacokinetics, indicative of a net time-dependent auto-induction effect.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nAs lorlatinib is metabolised in the liver, hepatic impairment is likely to increase lorlatinib plasma \n\nconcentrations. Clinical studies that were conducted excluded patients with AST or ALT > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, \n\nor if due to underlying malignancy, > 5.0 \u00d7 ULN or with total bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN. Population \n\npharmacokinetic analyses have shown that lorlatinib exposure was not clinically meaningfully altered \n\nin patients with mild hepatic impairment (n = 50). No dose adjustments are recommended for patients \n\nwith mild hepatic impairment. No information is available for patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nLess than 1% of the administered dose is detected as unchanged lorlatinib in urine. Population \n\npharmacokinetic analyses have shown that lorlatinib exposure was not clinically meaningfully altered \n\nin patients with mild (n = 103) or moderate (n = 41) renal impairment (CLcr > 30 mL/min). No starting \n\n\n\n17 \n\ndose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Information \n\nfor lorlatinib use in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) is limited (n = 1). \n\n \n\nAge, gender, race, body weight, and phenotype \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with advanced NSCLC and healthy volunteers \n\nindicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, and phenotypes \n\nfor CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology  \n\n \n\nIn Study A, 2 patients (0.7%) had absolute Fridericia\u2019s correction QTc (QTcF) values > 500 msec and \n\n5 patients (1.8%) had a change in QTcF from baseline > 60 msec.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, the effect of a single oral dose of lorlatinib (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) with and without \n\n200 mg once daily itraconazole was evaluated in a 2-way crossover study in 16 healthy volunteers. No \n\nincreases in the mean QTc were observed at the mean observed lorlatinib concentrations in this study. \n\n \n\nIn 295 patients who received lorlatinib at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily and had a ECG \n\nmeasurement in Study A, lorlatinib was studied in a population of patients that excluded those with \n\nQTc interval > 470 msec. In the study population, the maximum mean change from baseline for PR \n\ninterval was 16.4 msec (2-sided 90% upper CI 19.4 msec) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). Of these, \n\n7 patients had a baseline PR > 200 msec. Among the 284 patients with PR interval < 200 msec, 14% \n\nhad PR interval prolongation \u2265 200 msec after starting lorlatinib. The prolongation of PR interval \n\noccurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Atrioventricular block occurred in 1.0% of patients.  \n\n \n\nFor those patients who develop PR prolongation, dose modification may be required (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeat-dose toxicity \n\n \n\nThe main toxicities observed were inflammation across multiple tissues (skin and cervix of rats and \n\nlung, trachea, skin, lymph nodes and/or the oral cavity including mandibular bone of dogs; associated \n\nwith increases in white blood cells, fibrinogen, and/or globulin and decreases in albumin) and changes \n\nin the pancreas (with increases in amylase and lipase), hepatobiliary system (with increases in liver \n\nenzymes), male reproductive system, cardiovascular system, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, \n\nperipheral nerves and the CNS (potential for cognitive functional impairment) at dose equivalent to \n\nhuman clinical exposure at the recommended posology. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and \n\nQRS complex and PR interval were also observed in animals after acute dosing (approximately \n\n2.6 times the human clinical exposure at 100 mg after a single dose based on Cmax). All target organ \n\nfindings with the exception of hepatic bile duct hyperplasia were partially to fully reversible. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity \n\n \n\nLorlatinib is not mutagenic but is aneugenic in vitro and in vivo with a no observed effect level for \n\naneugenicity approximately 16.5 times human clinical exposure at 100 mg based on AUC.  \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lorlatinib. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nSeminiferous tubular degeneration and/or atrophy in the testes, and epididymal changes (inflammation \n\nand/or vacuolation) were observed in the rat and dog. In the prostate, minimal to mild glandular \n\n\n\n18 \n\natrophy was observed in dogs at dose equivalent to human clinical exposure at the recommended \n\nposology). The effects on male reproductive organs were partially to fully reversible. \n\n \n\nIn embryo-foetal toxicity studies, conducted in rats and rabbits, respectively, increased \n\nembryolethality and lower foetal body weights and malformations were observed.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Lorviqua is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Lorviqua is  \n\nLorviqua contains the active substance lorlatinib, a medicine that is used for treatment of adults with \n\nadvanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lorviqua \n\nbelongs to the group of medicines that inhibit an enzyme called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). \n\nLorviqua is only given to patients who have an alteration in the ALK gene, see How Lorviqua works \n\nbelow.  \n\n \n\nWhat Lorviqua is used for  \n\nLorviqua can be prescribed to you if \n\n- you have been previously treated with a medicine called alectinib or ceritinib, which are ALK \n\ninhibitors; or  \n\n- you have been previously treated with crizotinib followed by another ALK inhibitor. \n\nHow Lorviqua works \n\nLorviqua inhibits a type of enzyme called tyrosine kinase and triggers the death of cancer cells in \n\npatients with alterations in genes for ALK. Lorviqua is only given to patients whose disease is due to \n\nan alteration in the gene for ALK tyrosine kinase. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Lorviqua works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \n\nyou, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n2.

Tell your doctor right away about changes in your heart beat (fast or slow), \n\nlight-headedness, fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath. These symptoms could be signs of \n\nheart problems. Your doctor may check for problems with your heart during treatment with \n\nLorviqua. If the results are abnormal, your doctor may decide to reduce the dose of Lorviqua or \n\nstop your treatment. \n\n- speech problems, difficulty speaking, including slurred or slow speech. Your doctor may \n\ninvestigate further and may decide to reduce your dose of Lorviqua or stop your treatment. \n\n- mental status changes, mood or memory problems, such as change in your mood (including \n\ndepression, euphoria and mood swings), irritability, aggression, agitation, anxiety or a change in \n\nyour personality and episodes of confusion or loss of contact with reality, such as believing, \n\nseeing or hearing things that are not real.

These tests are to \n\ncheck the level of cholesterol, triglycerides and the enzymes amylase or lipase in your blood before \n\nyou start treatment with Lorviqua and regularly during treatment.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lorviqua \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained over the counter. This is because \n\nLorviqua can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some medicines can affect the way \n\nLorviqua works. \n\n \n\nYou must not take Lorviqua with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Lorviqua, at \n\nthe start of section 2. \n\n \n\nIn particular tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- boceprevir \u2013 a medicine used to treat hepatitis C. \n\n- buproprion \u2013 a medicine used to treat depression or to help people quit smoking. \n\n- dihydroergotamine, ergotamine \u2013 medicines used to treat migraine headaches.  \n\n- efavirenz, cobicistat, ritonavir, paritaprevir in combination with ritonavir and ombitasvir and/or \n\ndasabuvir, and ritonavir in combination with either elvitegravir, indinavir, lopinavir or \n\ntipranavir \u2013 medicines used to treat AIDS/HIV. \n\n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole \u2013 medicines used to treat fungal \n\ninfections. Also troleandomycin, a medicine used to treat certain types of bacterial infections. \n\n- quinidine \u2013 a medicine used to treat irregular heartbeat and other heart problems. \n\n- pimozide \u2013 a medicine used to treat mental health problems. \n\n- alfentanil and fentanyl \u2013 medicines used to treat severe pain. \n\n- ciclosporin, sirolimus, and tacrolimus \u2013 medicines used in organ transplantation to prevent \n\norgan rejection.  \n\n \n\nLorviqua with food and drink \n\nYou must not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit while on treatment with Lorviqua as they may \n\nchange the amount of Lorviqua in your body. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  \n\n \n\n- Contraception \u2013 information for women \n\nYou should not become pregnant while taking this medicine. If you are able to have children, \n\nyou must use highly effective contraception (for example, double-barrier contraception such as \n\ncondom and diaphragm) while on treatment and for at least 5 weeks after stopping treatment. \n\nLorlatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive methods (for example, birth \n\ncontrol pill); therefore, hormonal contraceptives may not be considered highly effective. If \n\nhormonal contraception is unavoidable it must be used in combination with a condom. Talk to \n\nyour doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. \n\n- Contraception \u2013 information for men \n\nYou should not father children during treatment with Lorviqua because this medicine could \n\nharm the baby. If there is any possibility that you may father a child while taking this medicine, \n\nyou must use a condom during treatment, and for at least 14 weeks after completing therapy. \n\nTalk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. \n\n- Pregnancy \n\n\u2022 Do not take Lorviqua if you are pregnant. This is because it may harm your baby.  \n\n\u2022 If your male partner is being treated with Lorviqua, he must use a condom during treatment \n\nand for at least 14 weeks after completing therapy.  \n\n\u2022 If you become pregnant when taking the medicine or during the 5 weeks after taking your \n\nlast dose, tell your doctor straight away.  \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n- Breast-feeding \n\nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 7 days after the last dose. This is because \n\nit is not known if Lorviqua can pass into breast milk and could therefore harm your baby. \n\n- Fertility \n\nLorviqua may affect male fertility. Talk to your doctor about fertility preservation before taking \n\nLorviqua. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou should take special care when driving and using machines when taking Lorviqua because of its \n\neffects on your mental state. \n\n \n\nLorviqua contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nLorviqua contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25 mg or 100 mg tablet, that is to say \n\nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Lorviqua \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \n\ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n\n- The recommended dose is one tablet of 100 mg taken by mouth once daily.  \n\n- Take the dose at about the same time each day. \n\n- You can take the tablets with food or between meals always avoiding grapefruit and grapefruit \n\njuice. \n\n- Swallow the tablets whole and do not crush, chew or dissolve the tablets. \n\n- Sometimes your doctor may lower your dose, stop your treatment for a short time or stop your \n\ntreatment completely if you feel unwell. \n\n \n\nIf you vomit after taking Lorviqua \n\nIf you vomit after taking a dose of Lorviqua, do not take an extra dose, just take your next dose at the \n\nusual time. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Lorviqua than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse right away. You may \n\nrequire medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Lorviqua \n\nWhat to do if you forget to take a tablet depends on how long it is until your next dose. \n\n- If your next dose is in 4 hours or more, take the missed tablet as soon as you remember. Then \n\ntake the next tablet at the usual time. \n\n- If your next dose is in less than 4 hours away, skip the missed tablet. Then take the next tablet at \n\nthe usual time. \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Lorviqua \n\nIt is important to take Lorviqua every day, for as long as your doctor asks you to.
