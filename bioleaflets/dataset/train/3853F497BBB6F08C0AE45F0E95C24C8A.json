CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nXigduo is indicated in adults for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and \nexercise:\n\uf0b7 in patients insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone \n\uf0b7 in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes in patients \n\ninsufficiently controlled with metformin and these medicinal products\n\uf0b7 in patients already being treated with the combination of dapagliflozin and metformin as \n\nseparate tablets.\n\nFor study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control and\ncardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nAdults with normal renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] \u2265 90 mL/min)\n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet twice daily. Each tablet contains a fixed dose of dapagliflozin \nand metformin (see section 2).\n\nFor patients insufficiently controlled on metformin monotherapy or metformin in combination with \nother medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes\nPatients insufficiently controlled on metformin alone or in combination with other medicinal products\nfor the treatment of diabetes should receive a total daily dose of Xigduo equivalent to \ndapagliflozin 10 mg, plus the total daily dose of metformin, or the nearest therapeutically appropriate \ndose, already being taken. When Xigduo is used in combination with insulin or an insulin \nsecretagogue such as sulphonylurea, a lower dose of insulin or sulphonylurea may be considered to \nreduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nFor patients switching from separate tablets of dapagliflozin and metformin\nPatients switching from separate tablets of dapagliflozin (10 mg total daily dose) and metformin to \nXigduo should receive the same daily dose of dapagliflozin and metformin already being taken or the \nnearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing medicinal \nproducts and at least annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal \nimpairment and in the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every \n3-6 months.\n\nThe maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that \nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering \ninitiation of metformin in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min.\n\nIf no adequate strength of Xigduo is available, individual mono-components should be used instead of \nthe fixed dose combination.\n\nTable 1. Dosage in patients with renal impairment\nGFR mL/min Metformin Dapagliflozin\n\n60-89\nMaximum daily dose is 3000 mg.\n\nDose reduction may be considered in \nrelation to declining renal function.\n\nMaximum total daily dose is 10 mg.\n\n45-59\nMaximum daily dose is 2000 mg.\n\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nDapagliflozin should not be initiated.\n\nMaximum total daily dose is 10 mg.\n\n30-44\nMaximum daily dose is 1000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nDapagliflozin is not recommended.\n\n< 30 Metformin is contraindicated. Dapagliflozin is not recommended.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThis medicinal product must not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and \n5.2).\n\n\n\n4\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nBecause metformin is eliminated in part by the kidney, and because elderly patients are more likely to \nhave decreased renal function, this medicinal product should be used with caution as age increases. \nMonitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, \nparticularly in elderly patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Risk of volume depletion with dapagliflozin \nshould also be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Xigduo in children and adolescents aged 0 to < 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nXigduo should be given twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions \nassociated with metformin.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nXigduo is contraindicated in patients with:\n\n- hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1;\n- any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis);\n- diabetic pre-coma;\n- severe renal failure (GFR < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2);\n- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as:\n\n- dehydration,\n- severe infection,\n- shock;\n\n- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as:\n- cardiac or respiratory failure,\n- recent myocardial infarction,\n- shock;\n\n- hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2);\n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nLactic acidosis\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.\n\nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), Xigduo should be \ntemporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.\n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) should be initiated with caution in \nmetformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic \ninsufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions \nassociated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic \nacidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed on the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia \nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking Xigduo and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/L, and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.\n\n\n\n5\n\nRenal function\nThe glycaemic efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in \npatients who have moderate renal impairment and is likely absent in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. Xigduo should not be initiated in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min and should be \ndiscontinued at GFR persistently below 45 mL/min (see section 4.2).\n\nMetformin is excreted by the kidney, and moderate to severe renal insufficiency increases the risk of \nlactic acidosis (see section 4.4). \n\nMonitoring of renal function:\nRenal function should be assessed:\n\u2022 Before initiation of treatment and regularly thereafter (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\u2022 For renal function with GFR levels < 60 mL/min and in elderly patients, at least 2 to 4 times per \n\nyear.\n\u2022 Prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and periodically \n\nthereafter.\n\u2022 If renal function falls persistently below GFR 45 mL/min, treatment should be discontinued.\n\u2022 Metformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR of < 30 mL/min and should be temporarily \n\ndiscontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3).\n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nanti-hypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with a NSAID.\n\nUse in patients at risk for volume depletion and/or hypotension\nDue to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin increases diuresis which may lead to the modest \ndecrease in blood pressure observed in clinical studies (see section 5.1). It may be more pronounced in \npatients with high blood glucose concentrations.\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure \ncould pose a risk, such as patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or \nelderly patients.\n\nIn case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), \ncareful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, \nlaboratory tests including haematocrit and electrolytes) is recommended. Temporary interruption of \ntreatment with this medicinal product is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion \nuntil the depletion is corrected (see section 4.8).\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nRare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been \nreported in patients treated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including \ndapagliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the condition was atypical with only \nmoderately increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). It is not known if DKA is \nmore likely to occur with higher doses of dapagliflozin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with dapagliflozin should be discontinued \nimmediately.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \n\n\n\n6\n\nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with dapagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating dapagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should \nbe considered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or \npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Xigduo in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and \nXigduo should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes mellitus \nstudies, DKA was reported with common frequency.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene) \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (see section 4.8). This is a \nrare but serious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and \nantibiotic treatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene is suspected, Xigduo should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics and \nsurgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection; \ntherefore, temporary interruption of treatment should be considered when treating pyelonephritis or \nurosepsis.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nElderly patients may be at a greater risk for volume depletion and are more likely to be treated with \ndiuretics.\n\nElderly patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, and/or to be treated with \nanti-hypertensive medicinal products that may cause changes in renal function such as \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). \nThe same recommendations for renal function apply to elderly patients as to all patients (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nCardiac failure\nThere is no experience in clinical studies with dapagliflozin in NYHA class IV.\n\nLower limb amputations\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term, clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot care.\n\n\n\n7\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking this medicinal product will test positive for glucose in \ntheir urine.\n\nAdministration of iodinated contrast agents\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Xigduo should be \ndiscontinued prior to, or at the time of, the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.5).\n\nSurgery\nXigduo must be discontinued at the time of surgery with general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. \nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition \nand provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\n\nChange in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes\nAs this medicinal product contains metformin, a patient with type 2 diabetes previously \nwell-controlled on it who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and \npoorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. \nEvaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, \nlactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, treatment must be stopped \nimmediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCoadministration of multiple doses of dapagliflozin and metformin does not meaningfully alter the \npharmacokinetics of either dapagliflozin or metformin in healthy subjects.\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed for Xigduo. The following statements reflect the \ninformation available on the individual active substances.\n\nDapagliflozin\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nDiuretics\nThis medicinal product may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase \nthe risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower \ndose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nused in combination with dapagliflozin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nThe metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9).\n\nIn in vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. \nTherefore, this medicinal product is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered \nmedicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on dapagliflozin\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, suggest that the \npharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin are not altered by pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, voglibose, \nhydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or simvastatin.\n\n\n\n8\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters \nand drug-metabolising enzymes) a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure (AUC) was \nobserved, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose \nadjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected.\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55%\nincrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on \n24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended.\n\nEffect of dapagliflozin on other medicinal products\nIn interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, dapagliflozin \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, hydrochlorothiazide, \nbumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P-gp substrate) or warfarin (S-warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the \nanti-coagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of \ndapagliflozin 20 mg and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in AUC of \nsimvastatin and 31% increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and simvastatin \nacid exposures are not considered clinically relevant.\n\nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative \nmethods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nMetformin\nConcomitant use not recommended\nCationic substances that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may interact with \nmetformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted in seven \nnormal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased \nmetformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring of \nglycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are coadministered.\n\nAlcohol\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment due to the metformin active substance of this medicinal \nproduct (see section 4.4). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should \nbe avoided.\n\nIodinated contrast agents\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis. Xigduo must be \ndiscontinued prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4).\n\nCombination requiring precautions for use\nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta-2 agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperfomed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the \ndose of the glucose-lowering medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and on its discontinuation.\n\n\n\n9\n\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \nproducts in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower \ndose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nused in combination with metformin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8)\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of Xigduo or dapagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in rats treated \nwith dapagliflozin have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to \nthe second and third trimesters of human pregnancy (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of this \nmedicinal product is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. A limited \namount of data from the use of metformin in pregnant women does not indicate an increased risk of \ncongenital malformations. Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonic or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).\n\nWhen the patient plans to become pregnant, and during pregnancy, it is recommended that diabetes is \nnot treated with this medicinal product, but insulin be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to \nnormal as possible, to reduce the risk of malformations of the foetus associated with abnormal blood \nglucose levels.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether this medicinal product or dapagliflozin (and/or its metabolites) are excreted in \nhuman milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of \ndapagliflozin/metabolites in milk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in nursing offspring \n(see section 5.3). Metformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nThis medicinal product should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of this medicinal product or dapagliflozin on fertility in humans has not been studied. In \nmale and female rats, dapagliflozin showed no effects on fertility at any dose tested. For metformin, \nstudies in animals have not shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nXigduo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nalerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when this medicinal product is used in combination with other \nglucose-lowering medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nXigduo has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent with coadministered dapagliflozin and metformin \n(see section 5.2). There have been no therapeutic clinical trials conducted with Xigduo tablets.\n\nDapagliflozin plus metformin\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled dapagliflozin add-on to metformin studies, the safety results \nwere similar to that of the pre-specified pooled analysis of 13 placebo-controlled dapagliflozin studies \n(see Dapagliflozin, Summary of the safety profile below). No additional adverse reactions were \nidentified for the dapagliflozin plus metformin group compared with those reported for the individual \n\n\n\n10\n\ncomponents. In the separate dapagliflozin add-on to metformin pooled analysis, 623 subjects were \ntreated with dapagliflozin 10 mg as add-on to metformin and 523 were treated with placebo plus \nmetformin. \n\nDapagliflozin\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn the clinical studies in type 2 diabetes, more than 15,000 patients have been treated with \ndapagliflozin.\n\nThe primary assessment of safety and tolerability was conducted in a pre-specified pooled analysis of \n13 short-term (up to 24 weeks) placebo-controlled studies with 2,360 subjects treated with \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 2,295 treated with placebo.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study (see section 5.1), 8,574 patients received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 8,569 received placebo for a median exposure time of 48 months. In total, \nthere were 30,623 patient-years of exposure to dapagliflozin.\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions across the clinical studies were genital infections.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in the placebo-controlled dapagliflozin plus \nmetformin clinical studies, dapagliflozin clinical studies and metformin clinical studies and \npost-marketing experience.

In active- and \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials (dapagliflozin, N=5936, All control, N=3403), the frequency of rash was \nsimilar for dapagliflozin (1.4%) and all control (1.4%), respectively.\n\n*Reported in \u2265 2% of subjects and \u2265 1% more and at least 3 more subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg \ncompared to placebo.\n\n**Reported by the investigator as possibly related, probably related or related to study treatment and reported in \n\u2265 0.2% of subjects and \u2265 0.1% more and at least 3 more subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to \nplacebo.\n\n\n\n12\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nDapagliflozin plus metformin\nHypoglycaemia\nIn studies with dapagliflozin in add-on combination with metformin, minor episodes of \nhypoglycaemia were reported at similar frequencies in the group treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus \nmetformin (6.9%) and in the placebo plus metformin group (5.5%). No major events of \nhypoglycaemia were reported. Similar observations were made for the combination of dapagliflozin \nwith metformin in drug-naive patients.\n\nIn an add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea study, up to 24 weeks, minor episodes of \nhypoglycaemia were reported in 12.8% of subjects who received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin \nand a sulphonylurea and in 3.7% of subjects who received placebo plus metformin and a \nsulphonylurea. No major events of hypoglycaemia were reported.\n\nDapagliflozin\nVulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections\nIn the 13-study safety pool, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections were reported in \n5.5% and 0.6% of subjects who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. Most \ninfections were mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and \nrarely resulted in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in \nfemales (8.4% and 1.2% for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively), and subjects with a prior history \nwere more likely to have a recurrent infection.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, the number of patients with serious adverse events \nof genital infections were few and balanced: 2 patients in each of the dapagliflozin and placebo \ngroups.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\nCases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene have been reported postmarketing in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, \nincluding dapagliflozin (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study with 17,160 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and a \nmedian exposure time of 48 months, a total of 6 cases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene were reported, one in the \ndapagliflozin-treated group and 5 in the placebo group.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the type of background therapy used in each study.\n\nFor studies of dapagliflozin as add-on to metformin or as add-on to sitagliptin (with or without \nmetformin), the frequency of minor episodes of hypoglycaemia was similar (< 5%) between treatment \ngroups, including placebo up to 102 weeks of treatment. Across all studies, major events of \nhypoglycaemia were uncommon and comparable between the groups treated with dapagliflozin or \nplacebo. In a study with add-on insulin therapy, higher rates of hypoglycaemia were observed (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nIn an add-on to insulin study up to 104 weeks, episodes of major hypoglycaemia were reported in\n0.5% and 1.0% of subjects in dapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin at Weeks 24 and 104, respectively, and \nin 0.5% of subjects treated with placebo plus insulin groups at Weeks 24 and 104. At Weeks 24 and \n104, minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported, respectively, in 40.3% and 53.1% of subjects \nwho received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin and in 34.0% and 41.6% of the subjects who received \nplacebo plus insulin.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, no increased risk of major hypoglycaemia was \nobserved with dapagliflozin therapy compared with placebo. Major events of hypoglycaemia were \nreported in 58 (0.7%) patients treated with dapagliflozin and 83 (1.0%) patients treated with placebo.\n\n\n\n13\n\nVolume depletion\nIn the 13-study safety pool, reactions suggestive of volume depletion (including, reports of \ndehydration, hypovolaemia or hypotension) were reported in 1.1% and 0.7% of subjects who received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively; serious reactions occurred in < 0.2% of subjects \nbalanced between dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, the numbers of patients with events suggestive of \nvolume depletion were balanced between treatment groups: 213 (2.5%) and 207 (2.4%) in the \ndapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (0.9%) and \n70 (0.8%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Events were generally balanced \nbetween treatment groups across subgroups of age, diuretic use, blood pressure and ACE-I/ARB use.\nIn patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, there were 19 events of serious adverse \nevents suggestive of volume depletion in the dapagliflozin group and 13 events in the placebo group.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, with a median exposure time of 48 months, events \nof DKA were reported in 27 patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients in the placebo \ngroup. The events occurred evenly distributed over the study period. Of the 27 patients with DKA \nevents in the dapagliflozin group, 22 had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the event. \nPrecipitating factors for DKA were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nUrinary tract infections\nIn the 13-study safety pool, urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for dapagliflozin \ncompared with placebo (4.7% versus 3.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). Most infections were mild \nto moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and rarely resulted in \ndiscontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in females, and \nsubjects with a prior history were more likely to have a recurrent infection.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, serious events of urinary tract infections were \nreported less frequently for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, 79 (0.9%) events versus \n109 (1.3%) events, respectively.\n\nIncreased creatinine\nAdverse reactions related to increased creatinine were grouped (e.g. decreased renal creatinine \nclearance, renal impairment, increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate). This \ngrouping of reactions was reported in 3.2% and 1.8% of patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg \nand placebo, respectively. In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (baseline \neGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) this grouping of reactions were reported in 1.3% and 0.8% of patients \nwho received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. These reactions were more common in \npatients with baseline eGFR \u2265 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (18.5% dapagliflozin 10 mg versus 9.3%\nplacebo).\n\nFurther evaluation of patients who had renal-related adverse events showed that most had serum \ncreatinine changes of \u2264 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. The increases in creatinine were generally transient \nduring continuous treatment or reversible after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, including elderly patients and patients with renal \nimpairment (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), eGFR decreased over time in both treatment groups. \nAt 1 year, mean eGFR was slightly lower, and at 4 years, mean eGFR was slightly higher in the \ndapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n\n\n14\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nRemoval of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. The most effective method to \nremove metformin and lactate is haemodialysis.\n\nDapagliflozin\nDapagliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 500 mg (50 times \nthe maximum recommended human dose). These subjects had detectable glucose in the urine for a \ndose-related period of time (at least 5 days for the 500 mg dose), with no reports of dehydration, \nhypotension or electrolyte imbalance, and with no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval. The \nincidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to placebo. In clinical studies where once daily doses of up to \n100 mg (10 times the maximum recommended human dose) were administered for 2 weeks in healthy \nsubjects and type 2 diabetes subjects, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was slightly higher than placebo \nand was not dose-related. Rates of adverse events including dehydration or hypotension were similar \nto placebo, and there were no clinically meaningful dose-related changes in laboratory parameters, \nincluding serum electrolytes and biomarkers of renal function.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the \npatient\u2019s clinical status.\n\nMetformin\nHigh overdose or concomitant risks of metformin may lead to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a \nmedical emergency and must be treated in hospital.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Combinations of oral blood glucose-lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD15\n\nMechanism of action\nXigduo combines two anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products with different and complementary \nmechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: dapagliflozin, a \nSGLT2 inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.\n\nDapagliflozin\nDapagliflozin is a highly potent (Ki: 0.55 nM), selective and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2.\n\nThe SGLT2 is selectively expressed in the kidney with no expression detected in more than 70 other \ntissues including liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, breast, bladder and brain. SGLT2 is the \npredominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into \nthe circulation. Despite the presence of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, reabsorption of filtered \nglucose continues. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by \nreducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. This glucose excretion \n(glucuretic effect) is observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24-hour dosing interval and is \nsustained for the duration of treatment. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this \nmechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Dapagliflozin does not \nimpair normal endogenous glucose production in response to hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin acts \nindependently of insulin secretion and insulin action. Improvement in homeostasis model assessment \nfor beta cell function (HOMA beta-cell) has been observed in clinical studies with dapagliflozin.\n\nUrinary glucose excretion (glucuresis) induced by dapagliflozin is associated with caloric loss and \nreduction in weight. Inhibition of glucose and sodium co-transport by dapagliflozin is also associated \nwith mild diuresis and transient natriuresis.\n\n\n\n15\n\nDapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into \nperipheral tissues and is > 1,400 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter \nin the gut responsible for glucose absorption.\n\nMetformin\nMetformin is a biguanide with anti-hyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia.\n\nMetformin may act via three mechanisms:\n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis;\n- by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation \nin muscle;\n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption.\n\nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin \nincreases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and \nGLUT-4).\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nDapagliflozin\nIncreases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in \nsubjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Approximately \n70 g of glucose was excreted in the urine per day (corresponding to 280 kcal/day) at a dapagliflozin \ndose of 10 mg/day in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks. Evidence of sustained \nglucose excretion was seen in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day for \nup to 2 years.\n\nThis urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in osmotic diuresis and increases in \nurinary volume in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary volume increases in subjects with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg were sustained at 12 weeks and amounted to \napproximately 375 mL/day. The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient \nincrease in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium \nconcentrations.\n\nUrinary uric acid excretion was also increased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a \nsustained reduction in serum uric acid concentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid \nconcentrations ranged from -48.3 to -18.3 micromoles/L (-0.87 to -0.33 mg/dL).\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of 5 mg dapagliflozin twice daily and 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily were \ncompared in healthy subjects. The steady-state inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption and the amount \nof urinary glucose excretion over a 24-hour period was the same for both dosing regimens.\n\nMetformin\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\n\nIn clinical studies, use of metformin was associated with either a stable body weight or modest weight \nloss.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nBoth improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are an \nintegral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe coadministration of dapagliflozin and metformin has been studied in subjects, with type 2 \ndiabetes, inadequately controlled on diet and exercise alone, and in subjects inadequately controlled on \n\n\n\n16\n\nmetformin alone or in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin), sulphonylurea or insulin. \nTreatment with dapagliflozin plus metformin at all doses produced clinically relevant and statistically \nsignificant improvements in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared with control. \nClinically relevant glycaemic effects were sustained in long-term extensions up to 104 weeks. HbA1c \nreductions were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, duration of disease, and baseline \nbody mass index (BMI). Additionally, at Week 24, clinically relevant and statistically significant \nimprovements in mean changes from baseline in body weight were seen with dapagliflozin and \nmetformin combination treatments compared with control. Body weight reductions were sustained in \nlong-term extensions up to 208 weeks. Additionally, dapagliflozin twice-daily treatment added to \nmetformin was shown to be effective and safe in type 2 diabetic subjects. Furthermore, two 12-week, \nplacebo-controlled studies were conducted in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and \nhypertension.\n\nIn a cardiovascular outcomes study (DECLARE), dapagliflozin as adjunct to standard care therapy \nreduced cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nGlycaemic control\nAdd-on combination therapy\nIn a 52-week, active-controlled non-inferiority study (with 52- and 104-week extension periods), \ndapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated as add-on therapy to metformin compared with a sulphonylurea \n(glipizide) as add-on therapy to metformin in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control \n(HbA1c > 6.5% and \u2264 10%). The results showed a similar mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to \nWeek 52, compared with glipizide, thus demonstrating non-inferiority (Table 3). At Week 104, \nadjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.32% for dapagliflozin and -0.14% for glipizide, \nrespectively. At Week 208, adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.10% for \ndapagliflozin and 0.20% for glipizide, respectively. At 52, 104 and 208 weeks, a significantly lower \nproportion of subjects in the group treated with dapagliflozin (3.5%, 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively) \nexperienced at least one event of hypoglycaemia compared with the group treated with glipizide \n(40.8%, 47% and 50.0%, respectively). The proportion of subjects remaining in the study at Week 104 \nand Week 208 was 56.2% and 39.7% for the group treated with dapagliflozin and 50.0% and 34.6%\nfor the group treated with glipizide.\n\nTable 3.

Dapagliflozin 5 mg twice \n\n\n\n17\n\ndaily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c at 16 weeks compared with subjects \nreceiving placebo (p < 0.0001; Table 4).\n\nThe reductions in HbA1c observed at Week 24 were sustained in the add-on combination studies. For \nthe add-on to metformin study, HbA1c reductions were sustained through Week 102 (-0.78% and \n0.02% adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively). At \nWeek 48 for metformin plus sitagliptin, the adjusted mean change from baseline for \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo was -0.44% and 0.15%, respectively. At Week 104 for insulin (with \nor without additional oral glucose-lowering medicinal products, including metformin), the HbA1c \nreductions were -0.71% and -0.06% adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and \nplacebo, respectively. At Weeks 48 and 104, the insulin dose remained stable compared to baseline in \nsubjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg at an average dose of 76 IU/day. In the placebo group there \nwas an increase of 10.5 IU/day and 18.3 IU/day from baseline (mean average dose of 84 and \n92 IU/day) at Weeks 48 and 104, respectively. The proportion of subjects remaining in the study at \nWeek 104 was 72.4% for the group treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 54.8% for the placebo group.\n\nIn a separate analysis of subjects on insulin plus metformin, similar reductions in HbA1c to those seen \nin the total study population were seen in subjects treated with dapagliflozin with insulin plus \nmetformin.

This effect was \nobserved at Week 1 of treatment and maintained in studies extended through Week 104.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly \ngreater reductions in FPG at Week 28: -3.66 mmol/L (-65.8 mg/dL), compared to -2.73 mmol/L \n(-49.2 mg/dL) for dapagliflozin alone (p < 0.001) and -2.54 mmol/L (-45.8 mg/dL) for exenatide alone \n(p < 0.001).\n\nIn a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with \ndapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in FPG at Week 24: -1.19 mmol/L (-21.46 mg/dL) compared to \n-0.27 mmol/L (-4.87 mg/dL) for placebo (p=0.001).\n\nPost-prandial glucose\nTreatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to sitagliptin plus metformin resulted in reductions \nin 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to Week 48.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly \ngreater reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at Week 28 compared to either agent alone.\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin as an add-on to metformin alone or metformin plus sitagliptin, sulphonylurea or insulin \n(with or without additional oral glucose-lowering medicinal products, including metformin) resulted in \nstatistically significant body weight reduction up to 24 weeks (p < 0.0001, Tables 4, 5 and 6). These \neffects were sustained in longer-term trials. At 48 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as add-on to \nmetformin plus sitagliptin compared with placebo was -2.07 kg. At 102 weeks, the difference for \ndapagliflozin as add-on to metformin compared with placebo or as add-on to insulin compared with \nplacebo was -2.14 and -2.88 kg, respectively.\n\nAs an add-on therapy to metformin in an active-controlled non-inferiority study, dapagliflozin resulted \nin a statistically significant body weight change compared with glipizide of -4.65 kg at 52 weeks \n(p < 0.0001, Table 3) that was sustained at 104 and 208 weeks (-5.06 kg and -4.38 kg, respectively).\n\nThe combination of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly \ngreater weight reductions compared to either agent alone (Table 8).\n\nA 24-week study in 182 diabetic subjects using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate \nbody composition demonstrated reductions with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin compared with \nplacebo plus metformin, respectively, in body weight and body fat mass as measured by DXA rather \nthan lean tissue or fluid loss. Treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin showed a numerical \ndecrease in visceral adipose tissue compared with placebo plus metformin treatment in a magnetic \nresonance imaging substudy.\n\nBlood pressure\nIn a pre-specified pooled analysis of 13 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg \nresulted in a systolic blood pressure change from baseline of \u20133.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure \n\n\n\n23\n\nof \u20131.8 mmHg versus \u20130.5 mmHg systolic and -0.5 mmHg diastolic blood pressure for placebo group \nat Week 24. Similar reductions were observed at up to 104 weeks.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a \nsignificantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at Week 28 (-4.3 mmHg) compared to \ndapagliflozin alone (-1.8 mmHg, p < 0.05) and prolonged-release exenatide alone (-1.2 mmHg, \np < 0.01).\n\nIn two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies a total of 1,062 patients with inadequately controlled\ntype 2 diabetes and hypertension (despite pre-existing stable treatment with an ACE-I or ARB in one \nstudy and an ACE-I or ARB plus one additional antihypertensive treatment in another study) were \ntreated with dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. At Week 12 for both studies, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus \nusual antidiabetic treatment provided improvement in HbA1c and decreased the placebo-corrected \nsystolic blood pressure on average by 3.1 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively.\n\nIn a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with \ndapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in seated systolic blood pressure at Week 24: -4.8 mmHg \ncompared to -1.7 mmHg for placebo (p < 0.05).\n\nPatients with baseline HbA1c \u2265 9%\nIn a pre-specified analysis of subjects with baseline HbA1c \u2265 9.0%, treatment with \ndapagliflozin 10 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c at Week 24 as an add-on \nto metformin (adjusted mean change from baseline: -1.32% and -0.53% for dapagliflozin and placebo, \nrespectively).\n\nGlycaemic control in patients with moderate renal impairment CKD 3A\n(eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)\n\nThe efficacy of dapagliflozin was assessed in a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 \nto < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who had inadequate glycaemic control on usual care.

All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either at least two additional cardiovascular risk \nfactors (age \u2265 55 years in men or \u2265 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidaemia, hypertension \nor current tobacco use) or established cardiovascular disease.\n\nOf 17,160 randomised patients, 6,974 (40.6%) had established cardiovascular disease and \n10,186 (59.4%) did not have established cardiovascular disease. 8,582 patients were randomised to\ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 8,578 to placebo, and were followed for a median of 4.2 years.\n\nThe mean age of the study population was 63.9 years, 37.4% were female. In total, 22.4% had had \ndiabetes for \u2264 5 years, mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean \nBMI was 32.1 kg/m2. \n\nAt baseline, 10.0% of patients had a history of heart failure. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, \n7.4% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30.3% of patients had micro- or\nmacroalbuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR] \u2265 30 to \u2264 300 mg/g or > 300 mg/g, \nrespectively).\n\nMost patients (98%) used one or more diabetic medications at baseline, including metformin (82%), \ninsulin (41%) and sulfonylurea (43%).\n\nThe primary endpoints were time to first event of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial \ninfarction or ischaemic stroke (MACE) and time to first event of the composite of hospitalisation for \nheart failure or cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were a renal composite endpoint and \nall-cause mortality.\n\nMajor adverse cardiovascular events\nDapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated non-inferiority versus placebo for the composite of cardiovascular \ndeath, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke (one-sided p < 0.001).\n\nHeart failure or cardiovascular death\nDapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated superiority versus placebo in preventing the composite of \nhospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). The difference in treatment effect \nwas driven by hospitalisation for heart failure, with no difference in cardiovascular death (Figure 2).\n\nThe treatment benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo was observed both in patients with and without \nestablished cardiovascular disease, with and without heart failure at baseline, and was consistent \nacross key subgroups, including age, gender, renal function (eGFR) and region.\n\n\n\n25\n\nFigure 1: Time to first occurrence of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death\n\nPatients at risk is the number of patients at risk at the beginning of the period. \nHR=Hazard ratio CI=Confidence interval. \n\nResults on primary and secondary endpoints are displayed in Figure 2. Superiority of dapagliflozin \nover placebo was not demonstrated for MACE (p= 0.172).

The difference between groups was \ndriven by reductions in events of the renal components; sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage renal \ndisease and renal death (Figure 2).\n\nThe hazard ratio for time to nephropathy (sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage renal disease and renal \ndeath) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.43, 0.66) for dapagliflozin versus placebo.\n\nIn addition, dapagliflozin reduced the new onset of sustained albuminuria (hazard ratio 0.79 \n[95% CI 0.72, 0.87]) and led to greater regression of macroalbuminuria (hazard ratio 1.82 \n[95% CI 1.51, 2.20]) compared with placebo.\n\nMetformin\nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed:\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034;\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017;\n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin \n13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and \nversus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n18.9 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.021);\n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin \n11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXigduo in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nXigduo combination tablets are considered to be bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding \ndoses of dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride administered together as individual tablets.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of 5 mg dapagliflozin twice daily and 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily were \ncompared in healthy subjects. Administration of 5 mg dapagliflozin twice daily gave similar overall \nexposures (AUCss) over a 24-hour period as 10 mg dapagliflozin administered once daily. As \nexpected, dapagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily compared with 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily \nresulted in lower peak dapagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) and higher trough plasma \ndapagliflozin concentrations (Cmin).\n\nInteraction with food\nThe administration of this medicinal product in healthy volunteers after a high fat meal compared to \nafter the fasted state resulted in the same extent of exposure for both dapagliflozin and metformin. The \nmeal resulted in a delay of 1 to 2 hours in the peak concentrations and a decrease in the maximum \nplasma concentration of 29% of dapagliflozin and 17% of metformin. These changes are not \nconsidered to be clinically meaningful.\n\n\n\n27\n\nPaediatric population\nPharmacokinetics in the paediatric population have not been studied.\n\nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nthis medicinal product.\n\nDapagliflozin\nAbsorption\nDapagliflozin was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum dapagliflozin plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in the fasted state. \nGeometric mean steady-state dapagliflozin Cmax and AUC\u03c4 values following once daily 10 mg doses of \ndapagliflozin were 158 ng/mL and 628 ng h/mL, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability of \ndapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%.\n\nDistribution\nDapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in various disease \nstates (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution of dapagliflozin \nwas 118 liters.\n\nBiotransformation\nDapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is \nan inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide or other metabolites do not contribute to the \nglucose-lowering effects. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an \nenzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP-mediated metabolism was a minor clearance \npathway in humans.\n\nElimination\nThe mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a single oral dose \nof dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of dapagliflozin \nadministered intravenously was 207 mL/min. Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily \neliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2% as unchanged dapagliflozin. After administration of \na 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, \napproximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug.\n\nLinearity\nDapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose over the range of \n0.1 to 500 mg and its pharmacokinetics did not change with time upon repeated daily dosing for up to \n24 weeks.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nAt steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \nmild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol plasma clearance) had mean \nsystemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32%, 60% and 87% higher, respectively, than those of subjects \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose \nexcretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted \nby subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment, respectively. The impact of haemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean Cmax and \nAUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, compared with healthy matched \ncontrol subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin were 40% and \n67% higher than matched healthy controls, respectively.\n\n\n\n28\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nThere is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects up to \n70 years old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can be \nexpected. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients \n> 70 years old.\n\nGender\nThe mean dapagliflozin AUCss in females was estimated to be about 22% higher than in males.\n\nRace\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposures between White, Black or Asian \nraces.\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased weight. Consequently, low-weight \npatients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with high weight somewhat decreased \nexposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful.\n\nPaediatric population\nPharmacokinetics in the paediatric population have not been studied.\n\nMetformin\nAbsorption\nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg or \n850 mg metformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral dose, the \nnon-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%.\n\nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear. At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally less \nthan 1 \u03bcg/mL. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n5 \u03bcg/mL, even at maximum doses.\n\nDistribution\nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean Vd ranged between 63-276 l.\n\nBiotransformation\nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.\n\nElimination\nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 mL/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 hours.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and \nblood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the \ndecrease in creatinine clearance, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCoadministration of dapagliflozin and metformin\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity.\n\n\n\n29\n\nThe following statements reflect the preclinical safety data of the individual active substances of \nXigduo.\n\nDapagliflozin\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and fertility. Dapagliflozin \ndid not induce tumours in either mice or rats at any of the doses evaluated in two-year carcinogenicity \nstudies.\n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity\nDirect administration of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and indirect exposure during late \npregnancy (time periods corresponding to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with respect to \nhuman renal maturation) and lactation are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of \nrenal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study, when dapagliflozin was dosed directly to young rats from postnatal day 21 \nuntil postnatal day 90, renal pelvic and tubular dilatations were reported at all dose levels; pup \nexposures at the lowest dose tested were \u2265 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. These \nfindings were associated with dose-related increases in kidney weight and macroscopic kidney \nenlargement observed at all doses. The renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile \nanimals did not fully reverse within the approximate 1-month recovery period.\n\nIn a separate study of pre- and postnatal development, maternal rats were dosed from gestation day 6 \nthrough postnatal day 21, and pups were indirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. (A \nsatellite study was conducted to assess dapagliflozin exposures in milk and pups.) Increased incidence \nor severity of renal pelvic dilatation was observed in adult offspring of treated dams, although only at \nthe highest dose tested (associated maternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures were 1,415 times and \n137 times, respectively, the human values at the maximum recommended human dose). Additional \ndevelopmental toxicity was limited to dose-related reductions in pup body weights, and observed only \nat doses \u2265 15 mg/kg/day (associated with pup exposures that are \u2265 29 times the human values at the \nmaximum recommended human dose). Maternal toxicity was evident only at the highest dose tested, \nand limited to transient reductions in body weight and food consumption at dose. The no observed \nadverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity, the lowest dose tested, is associated with a \nmaternal systemic exposure multiple that is approximately 19 times the human value at the maximum \nrecommended human dose.\n\nIn additional studies of embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits, dapagliflozin was administered \nfor intervals coinciding with the major periods of organogenesis in each species. Neither maternal nor \ndevelopmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at any dose tested; the highest dose tested is \nassociated with a systemic exposure multiple of approximately 1,191 times the maximum \nrecommended human dose. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at \nexposures up to 1,441 times the maximum recommended human dose.\n\nMetformin\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.\n\n6.

What Xigduo is and what it is used for\n\nThis medicine contains two different substances called dapagliflozin and metformin. Both belong to a \ngroup of medicines called oral anti-diabetics. These are medicines taken by mouth for diabetes.\n\nXigduo is used for a type of diabetes called \u201ctype 2 diabetes\u201d in adult patients (aged 18 years and \nolder) and usually occurs when you are older. If you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas does not \nmake enough insulin or your body is not able to use the insulin it produces properly. This leads to a \nhigh level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. \n\uf0b7 Dapagliflozin works by removing excess sugar from your body via your urine and lowers the \n\namount of sugar in your blood. It can also help prevent heart disease.\n\uf0b7 Metformin works mainly by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.\n\nTo treat diabetes:\n\uf0b7 This medicine is taken in combination with diet and exercise.\n\uf0b7 This medicine is used if your diabetes cannot be controlled with other medicines used to treat \n\ndiabetes.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may ask you to take this medicine on its own or together with other medicines to \n\ntreat diabetes. This may be another medicine taken by mouth and/or a medicine given by \ninjection, such as insulin or a GLP-1 receptor agonist (helps your body to increase the \nproduction of insulin when your blood sugar is high).\n\n\uf0b7 If you are already taking both dapagliflozin and metformin as single tablets, your doctor may \nask you to switch to this medicine. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking dapagliflozin and \nmetformin tablets, if you are taking Xigduo.\n\nIt is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse.\n\n\n\n54\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Xigduo\n\nDo not take Xigduo\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to dapagliflozin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had a diabetic coma.\n\uf0b7 if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see \u201cRisk of lactic \nacidosis\u201d below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called \u2018ketone \nbodies\u2019 accumulate in the blood and which can lead to a diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have severely reduced kidney function.\n\uf0b7 if you have a severe infection.\n\uf0b7 if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration), e.g. due to long-lasting or severe \n\ndiarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row.\n\uf0b7 if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your \n\nblood circulation or difficulties in breathing.\n\uf0b7 if you have problems with your liver.\n\uf0b7 if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either every day or only from time to time (please see \n\nsection \u201cXigduo with alcohol\u201d).\n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nRisk of lactic acidosis\nXigduo may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your \nkidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). \nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Xigduo for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Xigduo and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience \nsome of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include:\n\n- vomiting\n- stomach ache (abdominal pain)\n- muscle cramps\n- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness\n- difficulty in breathing\n- reduced body temperature and heartbeat\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xigduo, and during treatment:\n\uf0b7 if you have \u201ctype 1 diabetes\u201d \u2013 the type that usually starts when you are young, and your body \n\ndoes not produce any insulin. Xigduo should not be used to treat this condition.\n\uf0b7 if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, \n\nfast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, \na sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a \ndoctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of \u201cdiabetic \n\n\n\n55\n\nketoacidosis\u201d \u2013 a rare but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes \nbecause of increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of \ndeveloping diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol \nconsumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to \nmajor surgery or serious illness.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will check your kidney function.\n\uf0b7 if you have very high levels of glucose in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too \n\nmuch body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed at the top of section 4. Tell your \ndoctor before you start taking this medicine if you have any of these signs.\n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking medicines to lower blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of \nlow blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below under \u2018Other medicines and \nXigduo\u2019.\n\n\uf0b7 if you often get infections of the urinary tract. This medicine may cause urinary tract infections \nand your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. Your doctor may consider temporarily \nchanging your treatment if you develop a serious infection.\n\nIf you need to have major surgery, you must stop taking Xigduo during and for some time after the \nprocedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nXigduo. \n\nIt is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by \nyour health care professional.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u2019s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\nKidney function\nDuring treatment with Xigduo, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once every year or \nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this \nmedicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because it has \nnot been studied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Xigduo\nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Xigduo before or at the time of the \ninjection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nXigduo.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may \nneed more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may adjust the dosage of \nXigduo. It is especially important to mention the following:\n\uf0b7 if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics). Your doctor may ask \n\nyou to stop taking this medicine. Possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are \nlisted at the top of section 4.\n\n\n\n56\n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or \na \u201csulphonylurea\u201d medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, \nto prevent you from getting blood sugar levels that are too low (hypoglycaemia).\n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking cimetidine, a medicine used to treat stomach problems.\n\uf0b7 if you are using bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma.\n\uf0b7 if you are using corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis) \n\nthat are given by mouth, as an injection, or inhaled.\n\uf0b7 if you are using medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, \n\nsuch as ibuprofen and celecoxib).\n\uf0b7 if you are using certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and \n\nangiotensin II receptor antagonists).\n\nXigduo with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Xigduo since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis \n(see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should stop taking this medicine \nif you become pregnant, since it is not recommended during the second and third trimesters (the last \nsix months) of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while \nyou are pregnant.\n\nTalk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. You should \nnot use this medicine if you are breast-feeding. Metformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It \nis not known if dapagliflozin passes into human breast milk.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Taking it with \nother medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood, such as insulin or a \u201csulphonylurea\u201d \nmedicine, can cause too low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as \nweakness, dizziness, increased sweating, fast heart beat, change in vision or difficulties concentrating, \nand may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or use any tools or machines, if \nyou start to feel these symptoms.\n\nSodium content\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3.

belong to a group of medicines called oral anti-diabetics. these are medicines taken by mouth for diabetes. xigduo is used for a type of diabetes called \"type 2 diabetes\" in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) and usually occurs when you are older. if you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin or your body is not able to use the insulin it produces properly. this leads to a high level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. dapagliflozin works by removing excess sugar from your body via your urine and lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. it can also help
