This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nStaquis 20 mg/g ointment \n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne g of ointment contains 20 mg of crisaborole. \n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nPropylene glycol, 90 mg/g of ointment \n\n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nOintment. \n \n\nWhite to off-white ointment. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nStaquis is indicated for treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and paediatric \n\npatients from 2 years of age with ≤ 40% body surface area (BSA) affected. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \nAdults \n\n \n\nA layer of ointment is to be applied twice daily to affected areas.  \n\n \n\nThe ointment should only be applied to affected skin areas up to a maximum of 40% BSA. \n\n \nThe ointment can be used on all skin areas except on the scalp. Use on the scalp has not been studied.  \n\n \n\nThe ointment can be used twice daily for up to 4 weeks per treatment course. If any signs and/or \n\nsymptoms persist, or new areas affected with atopic dermatitis appear, further treatment course(s) can \n\nbe used as long as the application does not exceed 40% BSA (see section 5.1).  \n \n\nUse of the ointment should be discontinued if signs and/or symptoms on treated areas persist after 3 \n\nconsecutive treatment courses of 4 weeks each or if the signs and/or symptoms worsen during \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population  \n \n\nFor children and adolescents (2-17 years) the posology is the same as for adults. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Staquis in children less than 2 years of age has not been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nClinical studies in subjects with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. However, dosage \n\nadjustment is not expected to be necessary in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nClinical studies in subjects with renal impairment have not been conducted. However, dosage \n\nadjustment is not expected to be necessary in this patient population. \n\n \nElderly \n\nAtopic dermatitis is uncommonly observed in patients aged 65 years and over. Clinical studies of \n\nStaquis did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether \n\nthey respond differently from younger subjects (see section 5.1). However, dosage adjustment is not \n\nexpected to be necessary in this patient population. \n\n \nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nThe ointment is for cutaneous use only. \n\n \n\nThe ointment is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use (see section 4.4).  \n \n\nStaquis has not been specifically studied under occlusion. However, clinical experience available for \n\nuse of the ointment under occlusion (i.e., nappies or clothing) has not shown the necessity for any \n\ndosage adjustment. \n\n \nPatients should be instructed to wash their hands after applying the ointment, unless it is their hands \n\nthat are being treated. If someone else applies the ointment to the patient, they too should wash their \n\nhands after application. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe ointment is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use (see section 4.2). In cases of accidental \nexposure in the eyes or mucous membranes, the ointment should be thoroughly wiped off and/or \n\nrinsed with water. \n\n \n\nAvailable data indicate that local skin reactions, such as burning or stinging, may be more likely to \n\noccur on sensitive skin areas (such as the face and neck). \n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity, including contact urticaria, has occurred in patients treated with Staquis. \n\nHypersensitivity should be suspected in the event of severe pruritus, swelling and erythema at the \napplication site or at a distant site. If signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, Staquis should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nExcipients with known effect \n \n\nThis medicine contains 90 mg propylene glycol in each gram of ointment.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNeither crisaborole nor its two main metabolites are expected to cause drug interactions by induction \nor inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes based on in vitro and in vivo data (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, concomitant administration of Staquis and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., \n\nketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir) or CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., \n\nciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) can increase systemic crisaborole concentrations (see sec tion 5.2). \n \n\nStaquis has not been evaluated in combination with other cutaneous medicinal products used to treat \n\nmild to moderate atopic dermatitis and co-application on the same skin areas is not recommended. \n\nEmollients may be used on other areas of skin not affected by atopic dermatitis; co-application of \n\nemollients with Staquis on the same skin areas is not recommended.  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of crisaborole in pregnant women. Animal studies \n\ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Staquis during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nAnimal studies on milk excretion after topical application were not conducted. Staquis is systemically \n\nabsorbed. It is unknown whether crisaborole or its metabolites or excipients are excreted in human \n\nmilk following topical application of the ointment or has an effect on human milk production. The \n\nlack of clinical data during breast-feeding precludes a clear determination of the risk of Staquis to a \n\nbreastfed infant. Therefore, because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, Staquis \n\nshould not be used in breast-feeding women.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nReproduction studies in male or female rats using oral administration of crisaborole revealed no \n\neffects on fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nStaquis has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions are application site reactions (6.0%), including application site \n\npain, e.g., burning or stinging (4.4%). Generally, application site pain was noted early in the treatment \n\nperiod and was transient in nature, resolving spontaneously.  \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, with the most frequent first, using the \n\nfollowing convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n\n\n5 \n\n< 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Urticaria contact \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Application site reactions (e.g., application site \n\npain1, application site pruritus, application site \ndermatitis, application site erythema, application \n\nsite irritation, application site urticaria) \n1 Refers to skin sensations such as burning or stinging. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOverdose following cutaneous administration is unlikely. If too much of the ointment has been \napplied, the excess can be wiped off. \n\n  \n\nIn cases of accidental ophthalmic, oral mucosa, or intravaginal exposure, the ointment should be \n\nthoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed with water (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding \ncorticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH06  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCrisaborole is an anti-inflammatory benzoxaborole phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that \nsuppresses secretion of certain cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins \n\n(IL-2, IL-4, IL-5), and interferon gamma (IFNγ), and improves skin barrier function as measured by \n\ntransepidermal water loss (TEWL). Crisaborole applied on atopic dermatitis lesions of patients \n\nreduces expression of atopic inflammation associated chemokines including CCL17, CCL18, and \n\nCCL22.  \n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nTwo multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2), \n\nidentical in design, included a total of 1,522 subjects 2 to 79 years of age. 61.9% of subjects were \n\n2-11 years old, 24.4% of subjects were 12-17 years old, 13.3% of subjects were 18-64 years old, and \n\n0.5% of subjects were 65 years of age or older; the number of subjects ≥ 18 years of age was limited. \n\nThe treatable BSA ranged from 5% to 95% (mean = 18.3%, standard deviation [SD] = 17.8%; 9.6% of \n\nsubjects had > 40% treatable BSA); the trials did not include sufficient numbers of subjects with \n\n> 40% treatable BSA to determine the safety and efficacy of Staquis in this subpopulation. At baseline \n\n(pooled study data), 38.5% of the subjects had an Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA) \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nscore of 2 (Mild), and 61.5% had an ISGA score of 3 (Moderate), in the overall assessment of atopic \n\ndermatitis (erythema, induration/papulation, and oozing/crusting) on a severity scale of 0 to 4.  \n\n \n\nIn both trials, subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive Staquis or vehicle applied twice daily for \n\n28 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects at Day 29 who achieved an \n\nISGA grade of Clear (score of 0) or Almost Clear (score of 1) with at least a 2-grade improvement \n\nfrom baseline, comparing Staquis-treated subjects to vehicle-treated subjects. In both trials, a \n\nstatistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved this endpoint in the Staquis-treated \n\ngroup compared with the vehicle-treated group. \n\n \n\nThe secondary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of subjects at Day 29 with an ISGA grade of \n\nClear or Almost Clear and the time to achieve an ISGA grade of Clear or Almost Clear with at least a \n2-grade improvement from baseline.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Staquis on sensitive skin areas (such as the face and neck) compared to \n\nnonsensitive skin areas (such as the arms and legs) were not separately assessed in the clinical trials.  \n\n \nEfficacy results from the two trials are summarised in Tables 2 and 3. The Kaplan-Meier plots for the \n\ntime to achieve an ISGA score of Clear or Almost Clear with at least a 2-grade improvement from \n\nbaseline are provided in Figures 1 and 2.

Subjects at participating investigator sites (a subset of sites that participated in \n\nTrials 1 and 2) who completed Trials 1 or 2 without safety events that precluded further treatment with \n\nStaquis were eligible. \n\n \n\nSubjects participated in the study in 28-day treatment courses for up to 48 weeks. Subjects received \n\nStaquis for a variable number of treatment courses intermittently based on disease severity as \n\ndetermined by the ISGA at the beginning of each 28-day treatment course: subjects received \n\nopen-label treatment with Staquis twice daily (on-treatment when ISGA was Mild or worse [≥ 2]) or \n\nno treatment (off-treatment when the ISGA was Clear [0] or Almost Clear [1]). Discontinuation from \n\n\n\n10 \n\nthe study was to occur if there was no improvement in the subject’s ISGA after 3 consecutive \n\ntreatment courses of treatment with Staquis. \n\n \n\nTrial 3 did not include an efficacy endpoint; Staquis efficacy response based on ISGA determined the \n\nextent of intermittent use of Staquis for up to 48 weeks. Overall, subjects received a mean of \n\n6.2 on-treatment courses (out of a possible 13 on-treatment courses including the 28-day treatment \n\nperiod in Trials 1 or 2). The mean number of consecutive on-treatment courses was 3.6 and the mean \n\nnumber of consecutive off-treatment courses was 2.5.  \n \n\nQT study results \n\n \nResults from a thorough QT study of Staquis applied to 60% BSA in healthy volunteers did not \n\ndemonstrate QT prolongation. Although healthy volunteers had lower crisaborole concentrations \n\ncompared to patients with atopic dermatitis, clinical studies of Staquis did not identify any cardiac \n\neffects including prolongation of QT interval. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nStaquis in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (see \n\nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of Staquis were investigated in 33 paediatric subjects 2 to 17 years of age \nwith mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and a mean ± SD BSA involvement of 49 ± 20% (range 27% \n\nto 92%). In this study, subjects applied approximately 3 mg/cm2 of Staquis ointment (dose range was \n\napproximately 6 g to 30 g per application) twice daily for 8 days. Plasma concentrations were \n\nquantifiable in all subjects. The mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the \n\nconcentration time curve from 0 to 12 hours post dose (AUC0-12) for crisaborole on Day 8 were 127 ± \n196 ng/mL and 949 ± 1240 ng*h/mL, respectively. Systemic concentrations of crisaborole were at \n\nsteady state by Day 8. Based on the ratios of AUC0-12 between Day 8 and Day 1, the mean \n\naccumulation factor for crisaborole was 1.9. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-12) of crisaborole and \n\nits main metabolites increased with increasing % BSA treated.  \n\n \nThe studies were performed with a different formulation of crisaborole which, unlike Staquis, \n\ncontained butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). In vitro permeation testing (IVPT) was performed in intact \n\nskin to support therapeutic equivalence between the BHT-containing and the no-added BHT \n\nformulations. Although the results were inconclusive and highly variable, a possible slight increase in \n\npermeation is not expected to influence the benefit-risk profile of the product in patients with up to \n\n40% BSA affected to a clinically relevant extent. \n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBased on an in vitro study, crisaborole is 97% bound to human plasma proteins. \n\n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n\n \n\nCrisaborole is substantially metabolised into inactive metabolites. The main metabolite \n\n5-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxyl benzylalcohol (metabolite 1), is formed via multiple CYP enzymes \n\nincluding CYP3A4, 1A2 and hydrolysis; this metabolite is further metabolised into downstream \nmetabolites, among which 5-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxyl benzoic acid (metabolite 2), formed via \n\noxidation, is also a main metabolite. PK of metabolites 1 and 2 were assessed in the PK study \n\ndescribed above and the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state by Day 8. Based on the \n\nratios of AUC0-12 between Day 8 and Day 1, the mean accumulation factors for metabolites 1 and 2 \n\n\n\n11 \n\nwere 1.7 and 6.3, respectively. The mean ± SD Cmax and AUC0-12 for metabolite 2 on Day 8 were \n1850 ± 1830 ng/mL and 18200 ± 18100 ng*h/mL, respectively. Renal excretion of metabolites is the \n\nmajor route of elimination. Approximately 25% of the radiolabelled dose was absorbed and \n\npredominantly excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nDrug interactions \n\n \n\nPotential for crisaborole to influence the PK of other medicinal products \n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that under the conditions of clinical use, \n\ncrisaborole and metabolite 1 are not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.  \n\n \n\nIn vitro human liver microsomes studies for metabolite 2 showed that it did not inhibit activities of \n\nCYP2C19, 2D6, and 3A4; was a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 and 2B6; and a moderate inhibitor of \n\nCYP2C8 and 2C9. The most sensitive enzyme, CYP2C9, was further investigated in a clinical trial \n\nusing warfarin as a CYP2C9 substrate. The results of this study showed no drug interaction potential. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that under the condition of clinical use, crisaborole and metabolites 1 and 2 are \n\nnot expected to induce CYP enzymes. \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, crisaborole is metabolised to some extent (<30%) via CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. \n\nConcomitant administration of Staquis and potent CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitors may result in \n\nincreases in crisaborole systemic exposure. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies showed that crisaborole and metabolite 1 did not inhibit the activities of uridine \n\ndiphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15. Metabolite \n\n2 did not inhibit UGT1A4, 1A6, 2B7, and 2B15. Metabolite 2 showed weak inhibition of UGT1A1; \n\nhowever, no clinically significant drug interactions are expected between crisaborole (and its \n\nmetabolites) and UGT1A1 substrates at therapeutic concentrations. Metabolite 2 showed moderate \n\ninhibition of UGT1A9 and may result in a moderate increase of the concentrations of sensitive \n\nUGT1A9 substrates, such as propofol. A clinically relevant interaction between metabolite 2 and \n\npropofol is not anticipated due to the posology and method of administration of propofol (intravenous \n\ninfusion or injection with titration to clinical effect for anaesthesia or sedation). Drug interaction \n\nstudies with sensitive UGT1A9 substrates have not been conducted. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that under the condition of clinical use, crisaborole and metabolites 1 and 2 are \n\nnot expected to cause clinically significant interactions with substrates of transporters such as \n\nP-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anionic or cationic transporters. \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nPreclinical data from studies conducted in vitro or in vivo by the oral and dermal routes of \n\nadministration reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, juvenile toxicity, or toxicity to reproduction and \n\ndevelopment.  \n \n\nA drug-related increased incidence of benign granular cell tumours in the uterus with cervix and \n\nvagina (combined) was noted in crisaborole-treated female rats at oral doses approximately 2 times the \n\nmean human systemic exposure in maximum use conditions. The clinical relevance of this finding is \n\nunknown, however given the tumour type and benign status in a single species and single sex, the \nrelevance to humans is considered to be low. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n6.

What Staquis is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nStaquis contains the active substance crisaborole. Staquis is used on the skin to control the symptoms \n\nof mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children from 2 years of age. Atopic dermatitis, \n\nalso called atopic eczema, causes skin inflammation, redness, itchiness, dryness, and thickening in \npeople prone to allergies. The ointment should not be used on more than 40% of your body surface \n\narea. \n\n \n\nCrisaborole, the active substance in Staquis, is thought to work by reducing inflammation and some \n\neffects of the immune system (the body’s defences). \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Staquis  \n\n \n\nDo not use Staquis \n\n- if you are allergic to crisaborole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Staquis. \n\n \n\nStaquis is not for use in the eyes, mouth, or vagina; therefore, take care not to get this ointment into \n\nthese areas.
