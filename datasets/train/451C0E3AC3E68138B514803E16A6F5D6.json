NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nISENTRESS 400 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 400 mg of raltegravir (as potassium).\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach tablet contains 26.06 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nPink, oval tablet, marked with \"227\" on one side. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the \ntreatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nAdults\nThe recommended dosage is 400 mg (one tablet) twice daily.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe recommended dosage for paediatric patients of at least 25 kg body weight is 400 mg (one tablet) \ntwice daily. If unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet.\n\nAdditional formulations and strengths available\nISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation and in granules for oral suspension \nformulation Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing \ninformation.\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight \n(<2000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing \nrecommendations can be made.  \n\nThe maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations have \ndifferent pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension \nshould be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nand the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to \n18 years) or adults.\n\nISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg \ntablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) for treatment-na\u00efve patients or \npatients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. \nThe 400 mg tablet should not be used to administer the 1,200 mg once daily regimen. Refer to the \n600 mg Summary of Product Characteristics for additional dosing information.\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore,\nISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety \nand efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. \nTherefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nISENTRESS 400 mg tablets can be administered with or without food.\nThe tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split due to anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic \nprofile.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nPatients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been \nproven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. While effective viral \nsuppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual \ntransmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken \nin accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRaltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir \nshould be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure \nand the development of resistance (see section 5.1).\n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in \ncombination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate).\n\nDepression\n\nDepression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with \na pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a \npre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver \ndisorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.\n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nanti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches \nand pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-\nretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nAntacids\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced \nraltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids \nis not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nRifampicin\n\nCaution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of \nraltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with \nrifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are \nno data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions\n\nSevere, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking \nraltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. \nThese include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity \nreactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and \nsometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect \nagents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop \n(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, \nmuscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, \nangioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate \ntherapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of \nsevere rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.\n\nRash\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nraltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir \nwithout raltegravir (see section 4.8).\n\nLactose\n\nISENTRESS film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit \nUDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the \npharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.\n\nBased on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a \nUGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.\n\nConsiderable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of \nraltegravir.\n\nEffect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\n\nIn interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, \nmidazolam or boceprevir. \n\nIn some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of \nraltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir\n\nGiven that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when \nco-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces \nplasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if \nco-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be \nconsidered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in \npatients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug \nmetabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent \ninducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, \npioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 \ninhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors \n(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent \ncompared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of \nraltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 1). From the clinical trials, a \nlarge proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that \nresult in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety \nprofile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was generally \nsimilar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore, no dose adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir \nabsorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and \nmagnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir \nplasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium \ncontaining antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate \nantacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically \nmeaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing \nantacids no dose adjustment is required.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and \nfamotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of \nraltegravir (see Table 1). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton \npump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. \nTherefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.\n\nAll interaction studies were performed in adults.\n\nTable 1\nPharmacokinetic Interaction Data\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTI-RETROVIRAL\nProtease inhibitors (PI)\n\natazanavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 41 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 77 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 24 %\n\n(UGT1A1 inhibition)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\ntipranavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 24 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 55 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 18 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nefavirenz\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 36 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 21 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 36 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\netravirine\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 10 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 34 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 11 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\netravirine AUC \uf0ad 10 %\netravirine C12hr \uf0ad 17 %\netravirine Cmax \uf0ad 4 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or etravirine.\n\nNucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 49 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 3 %\nraltegravir Cmax \u2191 64 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\ntenofovir AUC \uf0af 10 %\ntenofovir C24hr \uf0af 13 %\ntenofovir Cmax \u2193 23 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate.\n\nCCR5 inhibitors\nmaraviroc\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 37 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 28 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 33 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nmaraviroc AUC \uf0af 14 %\nmaraviroc C12hr \uf0af 10 %\nmaraviroc Cmax \u2193 21 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or maraviroc.\n\nHCV ANTIVIRALS\nNS3/4A protease inhibitors (PI)\n\nboceprevir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 4 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 25 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 11 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction\nunknown)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or boceprevir.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTIMICROBIALS\nAntimycobacterial\n\nrifampicin\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 40 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 61 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 38 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nRifampicin reduces plasma \nlevels of raltegravir.

Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Raltegravir 400 mg twice \ndaily should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus.\n\nAnti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry\nTo monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, \nan Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register \npatients in this registry.\n\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in \norder to characterise the safety for the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in \nmilk (for details see section 5.3).\n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nRaltegravir should not be used during breast-feeding. As a general rule, it is recommended that \nmothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their babies in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nFertility\n\nNo effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in \n3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir.\nDizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with \nfixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-na\u00efve (N=547) and treatment-\nexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-na\u00efve adults have received \nraltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to \n96 weeks. See section 5.1. \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and \nabdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution \nsyndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less \nin clinical trials.\n\nRhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of \nraltegravir 400 mg twice daily.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in \ncombination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience,\nare listed below by System Organ Class.

reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-na\u00efve patients who initiated raltegravir \nin conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those \nexpected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was \nsimilar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nGrade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. \nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nFor each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital \nherpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, \ngastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.\n\nIn clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more \ncommonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing \nraltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to \nbe drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nIn clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C, \nand 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination \nwith other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B \nand/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or \nhepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat \nhigher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus.\n\nAt 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that \nrepresent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and \n13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % \nof all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Grade 2 or \nhigher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total \nbilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with \nraltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChildren and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age\nRaltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and \nadolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nIn these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, \nabnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic \nrash.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nOne patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which \nwere considered serious.\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nRaltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than \n2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 \nand 5.2). \n\nIn these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment \ndiscontinuation.\n\nHIV-1 Exposed Neonates\nIn IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg \nin weight.  Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 \nneonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks.  There were no drug \nrelated clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a \ntransient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to \nchild transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered \nnon-serious and not requiring specific therapy). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an \nelectrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that \nraltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX08.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRaltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is \nrequired for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of \nthe HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the \nproduction of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral \ninfection. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nRaltegravir at concentrations of 31 \uf0b1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication \n(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the \ncell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of \nmitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical \nisolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited \ninfection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with \nIC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM.\n\nResistance\n\nMost viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting \nfrom the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino \nacid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 \n(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, \nE92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral \nsusceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir \nsusceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline \nviral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir \ngenerally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at \namino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation \nconfers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino \nacid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically \nsignificant resistance to dolutegravir.\n\nClinical experience\n\nThe evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, \nProtocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the \nanalysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, \nProtocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients. \n\nEfficacy\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\nBENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntrials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a \ncombination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, \nwith documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of \nanti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the \npatient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median \nof 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. \n\nResults 48 week and 96 week analyses\nDurable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg \ntwice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 2.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nTable 2\nEfficacy Outcome at Weeks 48 and 96\n\nBENCHMRK 1 and 2 Pooled\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 96 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir \n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + \nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nRaltegravir \n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo +\nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL (95% CI) \n       All patients\u2020 72 (68, 76) 37 (31, 44) 62 (57, 66) 28 (23, 34)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 62 (53, 69) 17 (9, 27) 53 (45, 61) 15 (8, 25)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 82 (77, 86) 49 (41, 58) 74 (69, 79) 39 (31, 47)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 61 (53, 69) 21 (13, 32) 51 (42, 60) 14 (7, 24)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 80 (73, 85) 44 (33, 55) 70 (62, 77) 36 (25, 48)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 83 (76, 89) 51 (39, 63) 78 (70, 85) 42 (30, 55)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 52 (42, 61) 8 (3, 17)  46 (36, 56) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 81 (75, 87) 40 (30, 51) 76 (69, 83) 31 (22, 42)\n                                  2 and above 84 (77, 89) 65 (52, 76) 71 (63, 78) 56 (43, 69)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml :(95% CI)\n      All patients\u2020 62 (57, 67) 33 (27, 39) 57 (52, 62) 26 (21, 32)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 48 (40, 56) 16 (8, 26) 47 (39, 55) 13 (7, 23)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 73 (68, 78) 43 (35, 52) 70 (64, 75) 36 (28, 45)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 50 (41, 58) 20 (12, 31) 50 (41, 58) 13 (6, 22)\n                                 > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 67 (59, 74) 39 (28, 50) 65 (57, 72) 32 (22, 44)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 76 (68, 83) 44 (32, 56) 71 (62, 78) 41 (29, 53)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 45 (35, 54) 3 (0, 11) 41 (32, 51) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 67 (59, 74) 37 (27, 48) 72 (64, 79) 28 (19, 39)\n                                  2 and above 75 (68, 82) 59 (46, 71) 65 (56, 72) 53 (40, 66)\n\nMean CD4 Cell Change (95 % CI), cells/mm3\n\n       All patients\u2021 109 (98, 121) 45 (32, 57) 123 (110, 137) 49 (35, 63)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 126 (107, 144) 36 (17, 55) 140 (115, 165) 40 (16, 65)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 100 (86, 115) 49 (33, 65) 114 (98, 131) 53 (36, 70)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 121 (100, 142) 33 (18, 48) 130 (104, 156) 42 (17, 67)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 104 (88, 119) 47 (28, 66) 123 (103, 144) 56 (34, 79)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 104 (80, 129) 54 (24, 84) 117 (90, 143) 48 (23, 73)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 81 (55, 106) 11 (4, 26) 97 (70, 124) 15 (-0, 31)\n                                  1 113 (96, 130) 44 (24, 63) 132 (111, 154) 45 (24, 66)\n                                  2 and above 125 (105, 144) 76 (48, 103) 134 (108, 159) 90 (57, 123)\n\n\u2020\nNon-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed as failure thereafter.

For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-\nforward was used for virologic failures.\n\n\u00a7\nThe Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate \nshowed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in \nOBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.\n\nRaltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. \nSome patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with \nfailure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent. \n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nSwitch to raltegravir\nThe SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving \nsuppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir \n200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and \nn=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and \nn=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the \nnumber of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. \n\nThese studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to \ndemonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, \nsuppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group \nversus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 \nregarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adult patients\nSTARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and \nanti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a \ncombination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected \npatients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA \nlevel (\u2264 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or \nnegative).\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroup receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. \n\nResults 48-week and 240-week analyses\nWith respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 \n(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz.

This study enrolled \n126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to18 years of age. Patients were stratified by \nage, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the \n400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than \n12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.\n\nThe initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based \nupon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and \nacceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of \nlong term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of \nraltegravir (see section 4.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nTable 4\nBaseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Weeks 24 and 48 from IMPAACT P1066\n(2 to 18 years of age)\n\nParameter\nFinal dose population\n\nN=96\n\nDemographics\nAge (years), median [range] 13 [2 \u2013 18]\nMale Gender 49 %\nRace\n\nCaucasian 34 %\nBlack 59 %\n\nBaseline Characteristics\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL), mean [range] 4.3 [2.7 - 6]\nCD4 cell count (cells/mm3 ), median [range] 481 [0 \u2013 2361]\nCD4 percent, median [range] 23.3 % [0 \u2013 44]\nHIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL 8 %\nCDC HIV category B or C 59 %\n\nPrior ART Use by Class\nNNRTI 78 %\nPI 83 %\n\nResponse Week 24 Week 48\nAchieved \u22651 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline or \n<400 copies/mL 72 % 79 %\nAchieved HIV RNA <50 copies/ mL 54 % 57 %\nMean CD4 cell count (%) increase from baseline 119 cells/mm3\n\n(3.8 %)\n156 cells/mm3 \n\n(4.6 %)\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nIMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age \nwho had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child \ntransmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. \nRaltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in \ncombination with an optimised background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds \nof patients.\n\nTable 5\nBaseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Weeks 24 and 48 from IMPAACT P1066\n(4 weeks to less than 2 years of age)\n\nParameter N=26\n\nDemographics\nAge (weeks), median [range] 28 [4 -100]\nMale Gender 65 %\nRace\n\nCaucasian 8 %\nBlack 85 %\n\nBaseline Characteristics\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL), mean [range] 5.7 [3.1 - 7]\nCD4 cell count (cells/mm3 ), median [range] 1,400 [131 -3,648]\nCD4 percent, median [range] 18.6 % [3.3 \u2013 39.3]\nHIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL 69 %\nCDC HIV category B or C 23 %\n\nPrior ART Use by Class\nNNRTI 73 %\nNRTI 46%\nPI 19 %\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nParameter N=26\n\nResponse Week 24 Week 48\nAchieved \u22651 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline or \n<400 copies/mL 91 % 85 %\nAchieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL 43 % 53 %\nMean CD4 cell count (%) increase from baseline 500 cells/mm3\n\n(7.5 %)\n492 cells/mm3 \n\n(7.8 %)\nVirologic failure Week 24 Week 48\n\nNon-responder 0 0 \nRebounder 0 4\nNumber with genotype available* 0 2\n\n*One patient had a mutation at the 155 position.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nAs demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, \nraltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and \nCmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases \ndose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose \nproportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established \nin patients.\n\nWith twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the \nfirst 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight \naccumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.\n\nRaltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to \nfood in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple \ndoses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically \nmeaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and \nCmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir \nfollowing a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by \n4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and \n52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic \nvariability relative to fasting. \n\nOverall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed \nC12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % \nand the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in \nco-administration with food and concomitant medicines.\n\nDistribution\n\nRaltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to \n10 \u00b5M. \nRaltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable \nextent.\n\nIn two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was \nreadily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid \nconcentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second \nstudy (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower \nthan the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nBiotransformation and excretion\n\nThe apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life \n(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled \nraltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In \nfaeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of \nraltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely \nraltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and \n23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented \napproximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for \nby raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the \nformation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of \nraltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.\n\nUGT1A1 Polymorphism\nIn a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the \ngeometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr\nwas 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 \nactivity due to genetic polymorphism.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules \nfor oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, \nadministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, \n62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state. \nAdministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics \nto a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. \nThe effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.\n\nTable 6 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet, the chewable tablet, and the \ngranules for oral suspension, by body weight.\n\nTable 6\nRaltegravir Pharmacokinetic Parameters IMPAACT P1066 Following Administration of Doses \nin Section 4.2 (excluding neonates)\n\nBody weight Formulation Dose N*\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nAUC0-12hr (\u03bcM\u25cfhr)\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nC12hr (nM)\n\n\u2265 25 kg\nFilm-coated \n\ntablet 400 mg twice daily 18 14.1 (121 %) 233 (157 %)\n\n\u2265 25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing tables for the \n\nchewable tablet 9 22.1 (36 %) 113 (80 %)\n\n11 to less than \n25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing tables for the \n\nchewable tablet 13 18.6 (68 %) 82 (123 %)\n\n3 to less than \n20 kg Oral suspension\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing table for granules \n\nfor oral suspension 19 24.5 (43 %) 113 (69 %)\n*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose.\n\u2020Geometric coefficient of variation.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nElderly\nThere was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects \nand patients with HIV-1 infection over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over \nthe age of 65).\n\nGender, race and BMI\nThere were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass \nindex (BMI) in adults.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there \nwere no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal \ninsufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.\n\nHepatic impairment\nRaltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically \nimportant pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and \nhealthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has \nnot been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with \nraltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical \nexposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.\n\nMutagenicity\n\nNo evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) \ntests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal \naberration studies.\n\nCarcinogenicity\n\nA carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest \ndose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to \nthat at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the \nnose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in \nmales. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the \nnose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is \nlikely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure \nwas similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate \nmutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity\n\nRaltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase \nin incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat \nfoetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at the \nrecommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold \nhuman exposure at the RHD. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of raltegravir (as potassium).\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach 600 mg tablet contains 5.72 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nYellow, oval-shaped, dimensions 19.1 mm x 9.7 mm x 6.1 mm, marked with MSD corporate logo and \n\u201c242\u201d on one side and plain on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablets is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral \nmedicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, \nand paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nAdults and paediatric population\nIn adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), the recommended dosage is 1,200 mg (two \n600 mg tablets) once daily for treatment-na\u00efve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on \nan initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.\n\nAdditional formulations and strengths available\nISENTRESS is also available as a 400 mg tablet for twice daily use in HIV infected adults or children \nand adolescents at least 25 kg. The 400 mg tablet should not be used to administer 1,200 mg once \ndaily regimen (please refer to the 400 mg Summary of Product Characteristics).\n\nISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation and in granules for oral suspension \nformulation. Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional \ndosing information.\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight \n(<2000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing \nrecommendations can be made.  \n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nThe maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations have \ndifferent pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension \nshould be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or the 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets \nand the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to \n18 years) or adults.\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore, \nISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety \nand efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. \nTherefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablet formulation should not be used in children weighing less than \n40 kg.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nISENTRESS 600 mg tablets can be administered with or without food as a 1,200 mg once daily dose.\nThe tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split due to anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic \nprofile.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nPatients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been \nproven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. While effective viral \nsuppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual \ntransmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken \nin accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRaltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir \nshould be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure \nand the development of resistance (see section 5.1).\n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in \ncombination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate).\n\nDepression\n\nDepression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with \na pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a \npre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver \ndisorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.\n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nanti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches \nand pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-\nretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nAtazanavir\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with atazanavir resulted in increased raltegravir \nplasma levels; therefore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nTipranavir/ritonavir\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with tipranavir/ritonavir could result in decreased \nraltegravir trough plasma levels; therefore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nAntacids\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with calcium carbonate and \naluminium/magnesium containing antacids resulted in reduced raltegravir plasma levels; therefore,\nco-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nStrong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes\n\nStrong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., rifampicin) have not been studied with raltegravir\n1,200 mg once daily, but could result in decreased raltegravir trough plasma levels; therefore,\nco-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended.\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).\n\nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions\n\nSevere, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking\nraltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. \nThese include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity \nreactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and \nsometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect \nagents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop \n(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, \nmuscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, \nangioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate \ntherapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of \nsevere rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.\n\nRash\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nraltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir \nwithout raltegravir (see section 4.8).\n\nLactose\n\nISENTRESS film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro, raltegravir is a weak inhibitor of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 (IC50 of 109 \u00b5M) and \nOAT3 (IC50 of 18.8 \u00b5M). Caution is recommended when co-administering raltegravir 1,200 mg once \ndaily with sensitive OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates.\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit \nUDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and is not an inhibitor \nof P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting \npolypeptides (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporters (OCT)1 and OCT2, or multidrug \nand toxin extrusion proteins (MATE)1 and MATE2-K. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected \nto affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or \ntransporters.\n\nBased on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a \nUGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.\n\nConsiderable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of \nraltegravir.\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nEffect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\n\nIn drug interaction studies performed using raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir did not have a \nclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam or boceprevir. These findings can be \nextended to raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and no dosage adjustment is required for these agents.\n\nIn some studies, co-administration of raltegravir 400 mg tablets twice daily with darunavir resulted in \na modest but clinically insignificant decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations. Based on the \nmagnitude of effect seen with raltegravir 400 mg tablets twice daily, it is expected that the effect of \nraltegravir 1,200 mg once daily on darunavir plasma concentrations is likely to be not clinically \nmeaningful.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir\n\nInducers of drug metabolizing enzymes\nThe impact of medicinal products that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 such as rifampicin on \nraltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is unknown, but co-administration is likely to decrease raltegravir \ntrough levels based on the reduction in trough concentrations observed with raltegravir 400 mg twice \ndaily; therefore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended. The \nimpact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, \non UGT1A1 is unknown; therefore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not \nrecommended. In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the \npharmacokinetics of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily; therefore, other less potent inducers (e.g., \nefavirenz, nevirapine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with the \nrecommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nInhibitors of UGT1A1\nCo-administration of atazanavir with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily significantly increased plasma \nlevels of raltegravir; therefore, co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and atazanavir is \nnot recommended.\n\nAntacids\nCo-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with aluminium/magnesium and calcium \ncarbonate containing antacids are likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in the plasma \ntrough levels of raltegravir. Based on these findings, co-administration of aluminium/magnesium and \ncalcium carbonate containing antacids with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended.\n\nAgents that increase gastric pH\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis from ONCEMRK (Protocol 292) showed that co-administration \nof raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with PPIs or H2 blockers did not result in statistically significant \nchanges in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Comparable efficacy and safety results were obtained \nin the absence or presence of these gastric pH-altering agents. Based on these data, proton pump \ninhibitors and H2 blockers may be co-administered with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily.\n\nAdditional considerations\nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the drug interactions of ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir, \nboceprevir or etravirine with raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily. While the magnitudes of \nchange on raltegravir exposure from raltegravir 400 mg twice daily by ritonavir, boceprevir or \netravirine were small, the impact from tipranavir/ritonavir was greater (GMR Ctrough=0.45, GMR \nAUC=0.76). Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and tipranavir/ritonavir is not \nrecommended.\n\nPrevious studies of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily showed that co-administration of tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate (a component of emtricitabine/tenofovir disaproxil fumarate) increased raltegravir \nexposure. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disaproxil fumarate was identified to increase raltegravir 1,200 mg \nonce daily bioavailability by 12%, however its impact is not clinically meaningful. Therefore, co-\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nadministration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disaproxil fumarate and raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is \npermitted.\n\nAll interaction studies were performed in adults.\nComprehensive drug interaction studies were performed with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and a \nlimited number of drug interaction studies were performed for raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily.\n\nTable 1 displays all available interaction study data along with recommendations for \nco-administration.\n\nTable 1\nPharmacokinetic Interaction Data\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTI-RETROVIRAL\nProtease inhibitors (PI)\n\natazanavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 41%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 77%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 24%\n\n(UGT1A1 inhibition)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily).\n\natazanavir\n(raltegravir 1,200 mg single dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 67%\nraltegravir C24hr \uf0ad 26%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 16%\n\n(UGT1A1 inhibition)\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir\n(1,200 mg once daily) is not \nrecommended.\n\ntipranavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 24%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 55%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 18%\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily).\n\nExtrapolated from 400 mg \ntwice daily study\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir\n(1,200 mg once daily) is not \nrecommended. \n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nefavirenz\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 36%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 21%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 36%\n\n(UGT1A1 induction) No dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily and 1,200 mg once daily).\n\nefavirenz\n(raltegravir 1,200 mg single dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 14%\nraltegravir C24hr \uf0af 6%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 9%\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\netravirine\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 10%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 34%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 11%\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\netravirine AUC \uf0ad 10%\netravirine C12hr \uf0ad 17%\netravirine Cmax \uf0ad 4%\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily and 1,200 mg once daily) \nor etravirine.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nNucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 49%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 3%\nraltegravir Cmax \u2191 64%\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\ntenofovir AUC \uf0af 10%\ntenofovir C24hr \uf0af 13%\ntenofovir Cmax \u2193 23%\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily and 1,200 mg once daily) \nor tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate.\n\nemtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate \n(raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg)\nOnce Daily)\n\nPopulation PK analysis showed \nthat the effect of \nemtricitabine/tenofovir \ndisaproxil fumarate on \nraltegravir pharmacokinetics \nwas minimal (12% increase in \nrelative bioavailability), and \nwas not statistically or clinically \nsignificant.\n\n(Mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nCCR5 inhibitors\nmaraviroc\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 37%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 28%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 33%\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nmaraviroc AUC \uf0af 14%\nmaraviroc C12hr \uf0af 10%\nmaraviroc Cmax \u2193 21%\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily and 1,200 mg once daily) \nor maraviroc.\n\nHCV ANTIVIRALS\nNS3/4A protease inhibitors (PI)\n\nboceprevir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 4%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 25%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 11%\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir (400 mg twice \ndaily and 1,200 mg once daily) \nor boceprevir.\n\nANTIMICROBIALS\nAntimycobacterial\n\nrifampicin\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 40%\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 61%\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 38%\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nRifampicin reduces plasma \nlevels of raltegravir.

A moderate \namount of data on pregnant women (between 300 \u2013 1,000 pregnancy outcomes from first trimester \nexposure) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. Animal \nstudies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Raltegravir 1,200 mg is not recommended \nduring pregnancy.\n\nAnti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry\nTo monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, \nan Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register \npatients in this registry.\n\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in \norder to characterise the safety for the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in \nmilk (for details see section 5.3).\n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nRaltegravir should not be used during breast-feeding. As a general rule, it is recommended that \nmothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their babies in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\nFertility\n\nNo effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in \n3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir. \nDizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with \nfixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-na\u00efve (N=547) and treatment-\nexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-na\u00efve adults have received \nraltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to \n96 weeks. See section 5.1. \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and \nabdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were immune reconstitution \nsyndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less \nin clinical trials. \n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nRhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of \nraltegravir 400 mg twice daily.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in \ncombination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience,\nare listed below by System Organ Class.

Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nFor each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital \nherpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, \ngastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.\n\nIn clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more \ncommonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing \nraltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to \nbe drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nIn clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C, \nand 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination \nwith other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B \nand/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or \nhepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat \nhigher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus. \n\nAt 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that \nrepresent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and \n13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % \nof all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Grade 2 or \nhigher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total \nbilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with \nraltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nISENTRESS 600 mg tablet formulation has not been studied in paediatric patients (see section 4.2).\n\nChildren and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age\nRaltegravir twice daily has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected \nchildren and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in \nIMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose \nof raltegravir twice daily.\n\nIn these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, \nabnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic \nrash.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which \nwere considered serious.\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nRaltegravir twice daily has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less \nthan 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\nIn these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment \ndiscontinuation.\n\nHIV-1 Exposed Neonates\nIn IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg \nin weight.  Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 \nneonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks.  There were no drug \nrelated clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a \ntransient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to \n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\nchild transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered \nnon-serious and not requiring specific therapy). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an \nelectrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that \nraltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX08.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRaltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is \nrequired for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of \nthe HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the \nproduction of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral \ninfection. \n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nRaltegravir at concentrations of 31 \uf0b1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication \n(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the \ncell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of \nmitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical \nisolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited \ninfection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with \nIC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM.\n\nResistance\n\nMost viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting \nfrom the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino \nacid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 \n(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, \nE92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral \nsusceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir \nsusceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline \nviral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir \ngenerally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n40\n\namino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation \nconfers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino \nacid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically \nsignificant resistance to dolutegravir.\n\nClinical experience\n\nThe evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, \nProtocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients, the \nanalysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, \nProtocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients and the analysis of \n96-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (ONCEMRK, Protocol 292) in \nantiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients.\n\nEfficacy\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients (400 mg twice daily)\nBENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntrials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a \ncombination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, \nwith documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of \nanti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the \npatient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median \nof 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. \n\nResults 48-week and 96-week analyses\nDurable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg \ntwice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2\nEfficacy Outcome at Weeks 48 and 96\n\nBENCHMRK 1 and 2 Pooled\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 96 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + \nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo +\nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL (95 % CI) \n       All patients\u2020 72 (68, 76) 37 (31, 44) 62 (57, 66) 28 (23, 34)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 62 (53, 69) 17 (9, 27) 53 (45, 61) 15 (8, 25)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 82 (77, 86) 49 (41, 58) 74 (69, 79) 39 (31, 47)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 61 (53, 69) 21 (13, 32) 51 (42, 60) 14 (7, 24)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 80 (73, 85) 44 (33, 55) 70 (62, 77) 36 (25, 48)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 83 (76, 89) 51 (39, 63) 78 (70, 85) 42 (30, 55)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 52 (42, 61) 8 (3, 17)  46 (36, 56) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 81 (75, 87) 40 (30, 51) 76 (69, 83) 31 (22, 42)\n                                  2 and above 84 (77, 89) 65 (52, 76) 71 (63, 78) 56 (43, 69)\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\nBENCHMRK 1 and 2 Pooled\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 96 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + \nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo +\nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL (95 % CI)\n       All patients\u2020 62 (57, 67) 33 (27, 39) 57 (52, 62) 26 (21, 32)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 48 (40, 56) 16 (8, 26) 47 (39, 55) 13 (7, 23)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 73 (68, 78) 43 (35, 52) 70 (64, 75) 36 (28, 45)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 50 (41, 58) 20 (12, 31) 50 (41, 58) 13 (6, 22)\n                                 > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 67 (59, 74) 39 (28, 50) 65 (57, 72) 32 (22, 44)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 76 (68, 83) 44 (32, 56) 71 (62, 78) 41 (29, 53)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 45 (35, 54) 3 (0, 11) 41 (32, 51) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 67 (59, 74) 37 (27, 48) 72 (64, 79) 28 (19, 39)\n                                  2 and above 75 (68, 82) 59 (46, 71) 65 (56, 72) 53 (40, 66)\n\nMean CD4 Cell Change (95 % CI), cells/mm3\n\n       All patients\u2021 109 (98, 121) 45 (32, 57) 123 (110, 137) 49 (35, 63)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 126 (107, 144) 36 (17, 55) 140 (115, 165) 40 (16, 65)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 100 (86, 115) 49 (33, 65) 114 (98, 131) 53 (36, 70)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 121 (100, 142) 33 (18, 48) 130 (104, 156) 42 (17, 67)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 104 (88, 119) 47 (28, 66) 123 (103, 144) 56 (34, 79)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 104 (80, 129) 54 (24, 84) 117 (90, 143) 48 (23, 73)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 81 (55, 106) 11 (4, 26) 97 (70, 124) 15 (-0, 31)\n                                  1 113 (96, 130) 44 (24, 63) 132 (111, 154) 45 (24, 66)\n                                  2 and above 125 (105, 144) 76 (48, 103) 134 (108, 159) 90 (57, 123)\n\n\u2020\nNon-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed as failure thereafter. Percent of patients with response and \nassociated 95 % confidence interval (CI) are reported.\n\n\u2021\nFor analysis by prognostic factors, virologic failures were carried forward for percent < 400 and 50 copies/mL. For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-\nforward was used for virologic failures.\n\n\u00a7\nThe Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate \nshowed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in \nOBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.\n\nRaltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. \nSome patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with \nfailure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent. \n\nSwitch to raltegravir (400 mg twice daily)\nThe SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving \nsuppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir \n200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and \nn=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and \nn=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the \nnumber of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited.\n\nThese studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to \ndemonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, \nsuppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group \nversus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 \nregarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.\n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adult patients (400 mg twice daily)\nSTARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and \nanti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a \ncombination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected \npatients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA \nlevel (\u2264 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or \nnegative).\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroup receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. \n\nResults 48-week and 240-week analyses\nWith respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 \n(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz.

Raltegravir AUC and \nCmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases \ndose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose \nproportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg.\n\nWith twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the \nfirst 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight \naccumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.\n\nRaltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is also rapidly absorbed with median Tmax ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted \nstate and generates a sharper absorption peak with a tendency to higher Cmax in comparison to \nraltegravir twice daily (1 x 400 mg tablet twice daily). In addition, relative to the raltegravir 400 mg \nformulation the raltegravir 600 mg formulation used in the 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily dosing \nregimen has higher relative bioavailability (by 21 to 66%). Once absorbed, both formulations of \nraltegravir exhibit similar systemic pharmacokinetics. In patients, after 1,200 mg once daily raltegravir \ndosing, steady state AUC0-24 was 53.7 h\u00b7\u03bcM, C24 was 75.6 nM, and median Tmax was 1.50 h.\n\nRaltegravir 400 mg twice daily may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was \nadministered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. \nAdministration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir \nAUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr\nwas 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. \nAdministration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately \n2-fold and increased C12 hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal \ndecreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food \nappears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting.\n\nRaltegravir 600 mg tablets (2 x 600 mg once daily) may be administered with or without food. A \nsingle dose food effect study demonstrated that the 1,200 mg once daily had similar or smaller food \neffects when studied under high-fat and low-fat meal conditions when compared to the 400 mg twice \n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\ndaily. Administration of a low fat meal with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily resulted in a 42% \ndecrease in AUC0-last, 52% decrease in Cmax, and 16% decrease in C24hr. Administration of a high fat \nmeal resulted in a 1.9% increase in AUC0-last, 28% decrease in Cmax, and 12% decrease in C24 hr.\n\nOverall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed \nC12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % \nand the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in \nco-administration with food and concomitant medicines.\n\nDistribution\n\nRaltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to \n10 \u00b5M.\nRaltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable \nextent.\n\nIn two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was \nreadily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid \nconcentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second \nstudy (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower \nthan the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation and excretion\n\nThe apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life \n(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled \nraltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In \nfaeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of \nraltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely \nraltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and \n23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented \napproximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for \nby raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the \nformation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of \nraltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.\n\nUGT1A1 Polymorphism\nIn a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the \ngeometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr\nwas 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 \nactivity due to genetic polymorphism.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules \nfor oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, \nadministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, \n62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12 hr compared to administration in the fasted state. \nAdministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics \nto a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. \nThe effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.\n\nTable 5 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet, the chewable tablet, and the \ngranules for oral suspension, by body weight.\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nTable 5\nRaltegravir Pharmacokinetic Parameters IMPAACT P1066 Following Administration of Doses \nin Section 4.2 (excluding neonates)\n\nBody weight Formulation Dose N*\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nAUC0-12hr (\u03bcM\u25cfhr)\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nC12hr (nM)\n\n\u2265 25 kg\nFilm-coated \n\ntablet 400 mg twice daily 18 14.1 (121 %) 233 (157 %)\n\n\u2265 25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing tables for the \n\nchewable tablet 9 22.1 (36 %) 113 (80 %)\n\n11 to less than \n25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing tables for the \n\nchewable tablet 13 18.6 (68 %) 82 (123 %)\n\n3 to less than \n20 kg Oral suspension\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing table for granules \n\nfor oral suspension 19 24.5 (43 %) 113 (69 %)\n*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose.\n\u2020Geometric coefficient of variation.\n\nElderly\nThere was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range \nstudied with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on \nraltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range studied in ONCEMRK with raltegravir 1,200 mg \n(2 x 600 mg) once daily.\n\nGender, race, ethnicity and body weight\nThere were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race, ethnicity or body \nweight in adults for raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, and no clinically meaningful effect on raltegravir \npharmacokinetics was concluded. For raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily, population \nPK analysis also demonstrated that the impacts of gender, race, ethnicity and body weight are not \nclinically meaningful.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there \nwere no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal \ninsufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2 of the 400 mg twice daily SmPC). Because the \nextent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be \navoided. No renal impairment study was conducted with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily however, \nbased on results with the 400 mg twice daily tablet, no clinically meaningful effect is anticipated.\n\nHepatic impairment\nRaltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically \nimportant pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and \nhealthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has \nnot been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 400 mg twice daily SmPC). No hepatic impairment \nstudy has been conducted with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily, however, based on results with the \n400 mg twice daily tablet, no clinically meaningful effect is expected for mild and moderate hepatic \nimpairment.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with \nraltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical \nexposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nMutagenicity\n\nNo evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) \ntests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal \naberration studies.\n\nCarcinogenicity\n\nA carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest \ndose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to \nthat at the clinical dose of 1,200 mg once daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the \nnose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in \nmales. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the \nnose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is \nlikely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure \nwas similar to that at the clinical dose of 1,200 mg once daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to \nevaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity\n\nRaltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase \nin incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat \nfoetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at the \nrecommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 hr.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach chewable tablet contains 25 mg of raltegravir (as potassium).\nEach chewable tablet contains 100 mg of raltegravir (as potassium).\n\nExcipients with known effect 25 mg\nEach chewable tablet contains approximately 0.46 mg fructose, approximately 0.05 mg phenylalanine\n(as a component of aspartame) and approximately 1.4 mg sorbitol.\n\nExcipients with known effect 100 mg\nEach chewable tablet contains approximately 0.93 mg fructose, approximately 0.10 mg phenylalanine\n(as a component of aspartame) and approximately 2.8 mg sorbitol.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nChewable tablet\n\nChewable tablet 25 mg\nPale yellow, round, chewable tablet with MSD corporate logo on one side and \u201c473\u201d on the other side.\n\nChewable tablet 100 mg\nPale orange coloured, oval shaped, chewable tablet scored on both sides with the MSD corporate logo \nand \"477\" on one side and without inscription on the other side.\nThe tablet can be divided into equal 50 mg doses.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the \ntreatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1).\nThe maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily.\nBecause the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the \ngranules for oral suspension should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see \nsection 5.2). The chewable tablets and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in \nHIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.\n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\nPaediatric Population\nChildren at least 11 kg: weight based dose of the chewable tablet to a maximum dose of 300 mg, twice \ndaily as specified in Tables 1 and 2. The chewable tablets are available in 25 mg and scored 100 mg \nstrengths.\nSee section 5.2 regarding the limited data on which these dose recommendations are based.\n\nTable 1\nRecommended Dose* for ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets for Paediatric Patients Weighing at \nLeast 25 kg\n\nBody weight\n(kg)\n\nDose Number of chewable tablets\n\n25 to less than 28 150 mg twice daily 1.5 x 100 mg\u2020 twice daily\n28 to less than 40 200 mg twice daily 2 x 100 mg twice daily\n\nAt least 40 300 mg twice daily 3 x 100 mg twice daily\n*The weight-based dosing recommendation for the chewable tablet is based on approximately 6 mg/kg/dose \ntwice daily (see section 5.2).\n\n\u2020The 100 mg chewable tablet can be divided into equal 50 mg doses. However, breaking the tablets should be \navoided whenever possible.\n\nIf at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg to less than 25 kg: Weight based dosing, as \nspecified in Table 2.\n\nFor patients weighing between 11 and 20 kg, either the chewable tablet or oral suspension can be used, \nas specified in Table 2. Patients can remain on the oral suspension as long as their weight is below \n20 kg. Refer to Table 2 for appropriate dosing (see section 5.1).\n\nTable 2\nRecommended Dose* for ISENTRESS Granules For Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets in \nPaediatric Patients at least 4 weeks of age and weighing 3 to 25 kg\n\nBody Weight\n(kg)\n\nVolume (Dose) of \nSuspension\n\nto be Administered\n\nNumber of Chewable \nTablets\n\n3 to less than 4 2.5 mL (25 mg) twice daily\n4 to less than 6 3 mL (30 mg) twice daily\n6 to less than 8 4 mL (40 mg) twice daily\n\n8 to less than 11 6 mL (60 mg) twice daily\n11 to less than 14\u2020 8 mL (80 mg) twice daily 3 x 25 mg twice daily\n14 to less than 20\u2020 10 mL (100 mg) twice daily 1 x 100 mg twice daily\n20 to less than 25 1.5 x 100 mg\u2021 twice daily\n\n*The weight-based dosing recommendation for the chewable tablet, and oral \nsuspension in 10mL of water is based on approximately 6 mg/kg/dose twice daily \n(see section 5.2).\n\u2020For weight between 11 and 20 kg either formulation can be used.\nNote: The chewable tablets are available as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets.\n\u2021The 100 mg chewable tablet can be divided into equal halves.\n\nNo data are available in pre-term neonates.  The use of ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term \nneonates.  \n\nPatients should be instructed to keep scheduled appointments because the ISENTRESS dosage should \nbe adjusted as the child grows.\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nAdditional formulations and strengths available\nISENTRESS is also available in a 400 mg tablet and as granules for oral suspension for use. Refer to \nthe 400 mg tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing information.\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight \n(<2000 g) newborns have not been established.  No data are available in this population and no dosing \nrecommendations can be made.  \n\nISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg \ntablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) for treatment-na\u00efve patients or \npatients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. \nRefer to the 600 mg tablet SmPCs for additional dosing information.\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore,\nISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety \nand efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. \nTherefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nISENTRESS chewable tablets can be administered with or without food (see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nPatients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been \nproven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. While effective viral \nsuppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual \ntransmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken \nin accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRaltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir \nshould be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure \nand the development of resistance (see section 5.1).\n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in \ncombination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate). \n\nDepression\n\nDepression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with \na pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a \npre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver \ndisorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.\n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nanti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches \nand pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-\nretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nAntacids\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced \nraltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids \nis not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nRifampicin\n\nCaution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of \nraltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with \nrifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are \nno data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions\n\nSevere, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking \nraltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. \nThese include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity \nreactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and \nsometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect \nagents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop \n(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, \nmuscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, \nangioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate \ntherapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of \nsevere rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.\n\nRash\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nraltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir \nwithout raltegravir (see section 4.8).\n\nFructose\n\nISENTRESS chewable tablets contain fructose and sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit \nUDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the \npharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.\n\nBased on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a \nUGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.\n\nConsiderable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of \nraltegravir.\n\nEffect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\n\nIn interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, \nmidazolam or boceprevir. \n\nIn some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of \nraltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.\n\n \n\n\n\n54\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir\n\nGiven that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when \nco-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces \nplasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if \nco-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be \nconsidered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in \npatients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug \nmetabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent \ninducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, \npioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 \ninhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors \n(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent \ncompared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of \nraltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 3). From the clinical trials, a \nlarge proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that \nresult in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety \nprofile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was generally \nsimilar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore, no dose adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir \nabsorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and \nmagnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir \nplasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium \ncontaining antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate \nantacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically \nmeaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing \nantacids no dose adjustment is required.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and \nfamotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of \nraltegravir (see Table 3). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton \npump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. \nTherefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.\n\nAll interaction studies have been performed in adults.\n\nTable 3\nPharmacokinetic Interaction Data in Adults\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTI-RETROVIRAL\nProtease inhibitors (PI)\n\natazanavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 41 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 77 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 24 %\n\n(UGT1A1 inhibition)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\n \n\n\n\n55\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\ntipranavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 24 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 55 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 18 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nefavirenz\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 36 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 21 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 36 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\netravirine\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 10 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 34 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 11 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\netravirine AUC \uf0ad 10 %\netravirine C12hr \uf0ad 17 %\netravirine Cmax \uf0ad 4 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or etravirine.\n\nNucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 49 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 3 %\nraltegravir Cmax \u2191 64 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\ntenofovir AUC \uf0af 10 %\ntenofovir C24hr \uf0af 13 %\ntenofovir Cmax \u2193 23 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate.\n\nCCR5 inhibitors\nmaraviroc\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 37 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 28 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 33 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nmaraviroc AUC \uf0af 14 %\nmaraviroc C12hr \uf0af 10 %\nmaraviroc Cmax \u2193 21 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or maraviroc.\n\nHCV ANTIVIRALS\nNS3/4A protease inhibitors (PI)\n\nboceprevir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 4 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 25 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 11 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or boceprevir.\n\n \n\n\n\n56\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTIMICROBIALS\nAntimycobacterial\n\nrifampicin\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 40 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 61 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 38 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nRifampicin reduces plasma \nlevels of raltegravir.

A moderate amount \nof data on pregnant women (between 300 \u2013 1,000 pregnancy outcomes from first trimester exposure) \nindicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of raltegravir 400 mg film-coated tablets twice \ndaily. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Raltegravir chewable tablets \nshould be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \nSee section 4.2 for dosing recommendations.\n\nAnti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry\nTo monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, \nan Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register \npatients in this registry.\n\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in \norder to characterise the safety for the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in \nmilk (for details see section 5.3).\n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nRaltegravir should not be used during breast-feeding. As a general rule, it is recommended that \nmothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their babies in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\n \n\n\n\n58\n\nFertility\n\nNo effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in \n3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir.\nDizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with \nfixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-na\u00efve (N=547) and treatment-\nexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-na\u00efve adults have received \nraltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to \n96 weeks. See section 5.1. \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and \nabdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution \nsyndrome and rash.

reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-na\u00efve patients who initiated raltegravir\nin conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those \nexpected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was \nsimilar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.\n\n \n\n\n\n61\n\nGrade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. \nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nFor each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital \nherpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, \ngastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.\n\nIn clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more \ncommonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing \nraltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to \nbe drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nIn clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C, \nand 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination \nwith other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B \nand/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or \nhepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat \nhigher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\n\nAt 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that \nrepresent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and \n13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % \nof all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Grade 2 or \nhigher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total \nbilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with \nraltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChildren and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age\nRaltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and \nadolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nIn these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, \nabnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic \nrash.\n\n \n\n\n\n62\n\nOne patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which \nwere considered serious.\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nRaltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than \n2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 \nand 5.2).\n\nIn these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment \ndiscontinuation.\n\nHIV-1 Exposed Neonates\nIn IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg \nin weight.  Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 \nneonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks.  There were no drug \nrelated clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a \ntransient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to \nchild transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered \nnon-serious and not requiring specific therapy). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir. \n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an \nelectrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that \nraltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX08.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRaltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is \nrequired for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of \nthe HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the \nproduction of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral \ninfection. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n63\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nRaltegravir at concentrations of 31 \uf0b1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication \n(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the \ncell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of \nmitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical \nisolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited \ninfection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with \nIC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. \n\nResistance\n\nMost viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting \nfrom the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino \nacid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 \n(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, \nE92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral \nsusceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir \nsusceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline \nviral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir \ngenerally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at \namino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation \nconfers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino \nacid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically \nsignificant resistance to dolutegravir.\n\nClinical experience\n\nThe evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, \nProtocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the \nanalysis of 240-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, \nProtocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients.\n\nEfficacy\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\nBENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntrials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a \ncombination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, \nwith documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of \nanti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the \npatient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median \nof 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. \n\nResults 48 week and 96 week analyses\nDurable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg \ntwice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 4.\n\n \n\n\n\n64\n\nTable 4\nEfficacy Outcome at Weeks 48 and 96\n\nBENCHMRK 1 and 2 Pooled\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 96 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir \n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + \nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nRaltegravir \n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + OBT\n(N = 237)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL (95 % CI) \n       All patients\u2020 72 (68, 76) 37 (31, 44) 62 (57, 66) 28 (23, 34)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 62 (53, 69) 17 (9, 27) 53 (45, 61) 15 (8, 25)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 82 (77, 86) 49 (41, 58) 74 (69, 79) 39 (31, 47)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 61 (53, 69) 21 (13, 32) 51 (42, 60) 14 (7, 24)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 80 (73, 85) 44 (33, 55) 70 (62, 77) 36 (25, 48)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 83 (76, 89) 51 (39, 63) 78 (70, 85) 42 (30, 55)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 52 (42, 61) 8 (3, 17)  46 (36, 56) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 81 (75, 87) 40 (30, 51) 76 (69, 83) 31 (22, 42)\n                                  2 and above 84 (77, 89) 65 (52, 76) 71 (63, 78) 56 (43, 69)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL (95 % CI)\n       All patients\u2020 62 (57, 67) 33 (27, 39) 57 (52, 62) 26 (21, 32)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 48 (40, 56) 16 (8, 26) 47 (39, 55) 13 (7, 23)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 73 (68, 78) 43 (35, 52) 70 (64, 75) 36 (28, 45)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 50 (41, 58) 20 (12, 31) 50 (41, 58) 13 (6, 22)\n                                 > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 67 (59, 74) 39 (28, 50) 65 (57, 72) 32 (22, 44)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 76 (68, 83) 44 (32, 56) 71 (62, 78) 41 (29, 53)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 45 (35, 54) 3 (0, 11) 41 (32, 51) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 67 (59, 74) 37 (27, 48) 72 (64, 79) 28 (19, 39)\n                                  2 and above 75 (68, 82) 59 (46, 71) 65 (56, 72) 53 (40, 66)\nMean CD4 Cell Change (95 % CI), cells/mm3\n\n       All patients\u2021 109 (98, 121) 45 (32, 57) 123 (110, 137) 49 (35, 63)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 126 (107, 144) 36 (17, 55) 140 (115, 165) 40 (16, 65)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 100 (86, 115) 49 (33, 65) 114 (98, 131) 53 (36, 70)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 121 (100, 142) 33 (18, 48) 130 (104, 156) 42 (17, 67)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 104 (88, 119) 47 (28, 66) 123 (103, 144) 56 (34, 79)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 104 (80, 129) 54 (24, 84) 117 (90, 143) 48 (23, 73)\n\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 81 (55, 106) 11 (4, 26) 97 (70, 124) 15 (-0, 31)\n                                  1 113 (96, 130) 44 (24, 63) 132 (111, 154) 45 (24, 66)\n                                  2 and above 125 (105, 144) 76 (48, 103) 134 (108, 159) 90 (57, 123)\n\n\u2020\nNon-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed as failure thereafter.

For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-\nforward was used for virologic failures.\n\n\u00a7\nThe Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate \nshowed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active \ndrug in OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.\n\nRaltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. \nSome patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with \nfailure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent. \n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nSwitch to raltegravir\nThe SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving \nsuppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir \n200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and \nn=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and \nn=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the \nnumber of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. \n\nThese studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to \ndemonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, \nsuppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group \nversus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 \nregarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adult patients\nSTARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and \nanti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a \ncombination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected \npatients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA \nlevel (\u2264 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or \nnegative).\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroup receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime. \n\nResults 48-week and 240-week analyses\nWith respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA \n< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 \n(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment difference (raltegravir \u2013 efavirenz) was 4.2 % \nwith an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inferior to efavirenz (p-\nvalue for non-inferiority < 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment difference (raltegravir \u2013 efavirenz) was \n9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the \nrecommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5\nEfficacy Outcome at Weeks 48 and 240\n\nSTARTMRK Study\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 240 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice daily\n\n(N = 281)\n\nEfavirenz\n600 mg\n\nat bedtime\n(N = 282)\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice \n\ndaily\n(N = 281)\n\nEfavirenz\n600 mg\n\nat bedtime\n(N = 282)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL (95 % CI) \n       All patients\u2020 86 (81, 90) 82 (77, 86) 71 (65, 76) 61 (55, 67)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 91 (85, 95) 89 (83, 94) 70 (62, 77) 65 (56, 72)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 93 (86, 97) 89 (82, 94) 72 (64, 80) 58 (49, 66)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 84 (64, 95) 86 (67, 96) 58 (37, 77) 77 (58, 90)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 89 (81, 95) 86 (77, 92) 67 (57, 76) 60 (50, 69)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 94 (89, 98) 92 (87, 96) 76 (68, 82) 60 (51, 68)\n              Viral Subtype Clade B 90 (85, 94) 89 (83, 93) 71 (65, 77) 59 (52, 65)\n                                     Non-Clade B 96 (87, 100) 91 (78, 97) 68 (54, 79) 70 (54, 82)\n\n \n\n\n\n66\n\nSTARTMRK Study\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 240 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice daily\n\n(N = 281)\n\nEfavirenz\n600 mg\n\nat bedtime\n(N = 282)\n\nRaltegravir\n400 mg twice \n\ndaily\n(N = 281)\n\nEfavirenz\n600 mg\n\nat bedtime\n(N = 282)\n\nMean CD4 Cell Change (95 % CI), cells/mm3\n\n       All patients\u2021 189 (174, 204) 163 (148, 178) 374 (345, 403) 312 (284, 339)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA  > 100,000 copies/mL 196 (174, 219) 192 (169, 214) 392 (350, 435) 329 (293, 364)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 180 (160, 200) 134 (115, 153) 350 (312, 388) 294 (251, 337)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 170 (122, 218) 152 (123, 180) 304 (209, 399) 314 (242, 386)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 193 (169, 217) 175 (151, 198) 413 (360, 465) 306 (264, 348)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 190 (168, 212) 157 (134, 181) 358 (321, 395) 316 (272, 359)\n              Viral Subtype Clade B 187 (170, 204) 164 (147, 181) 380 (346, 414) 303 (272, 333)\n                                     Non-Clade B 189 (153, 225) 156 (121, 190) 332 (275, 388) 329 (260, 398) \n\n\u2020 Non-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed as failure thereafter.

This study enrolled \n126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Patients were stratified by \nage, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the \n400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than \n12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.\n\nThe initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based \nupon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and \nacceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of \nlong term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of \nraltegravir (see section 4.2).\n\nTable 6\nBaseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Weeks 24 and 48 from IMPAACT P1066\n(2 to 18 years of age)\n\nParameter\nFinal dose population\n\nN=96\n\nDemographics\nAge (years), median [range] 13 [2 \u2013 18]\nMale Gender 49 %\nRace\n\nCaucasian 34 %\nBlack 59 %\n\nBaseline Characteristics\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL), mean [range] 4.3 [2.7 - 6]\nCD4 cell count (cells/mm3), median [range] 481 [0 \u2013 2361]\nCD4 percent, median [range] 23.3 % [0 \u2013 44]\nHIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL 8 %\nCDC HIV category B or C 59 %\n\n \n\n\n\n67\n\nParameter\nFinal dose population\n\nN=96\n\nPrior ART Use by Class\nNNRTI 78 %\nPI 83 %\n\nResponse Week 24 Week 48\nAchieved \u22651 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline or \n<400 copies/mL 72 % 79 %\nAchieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL 54 % 57 %\nMean CD4 cell count (%) increase from baseline 119 cells/mm3\n\n(3.8 %)\n156 cells/mm3 \n\n(4.6 %)\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nIMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age \nwho had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child \ntransmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. \nRaltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in \ncombination with an optimised background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds \nof patients.\n\nTable 7\nBaseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Weeks 24 and 48 from IMPAACT P1066\n(4 weeks to less than 2 years of age)\n\nParameter N=26\n\nDemographics\nAge (weeks), median [range] 28 [4 -100]\nMale Gender 65 %\nRace\n\nCaucasian 8 %\nBlack 85 %\n\nBaseline Characteristics\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL), mean [range] 5.7 [3.1 - 7]\nCD4 cell count (cells/mm3 ), median [range] 1,400 [131 -3,648]\nCD4 percent, median [range] 18.6 % [3.3 \u2013 39.3]\nHIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL 69 %\nCDC HIV category B or C 23 %\n\nPrior ART Use by Class\nNNRTI 73 %\nNRTI 46%\nPI 19 %\n\nResponse Week 24 Week 48\nAchieved \u22651 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline or \n<400 copies/mL 91 % 85 %\nAchieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL 43 % 53 %\nMean CD4 cell count (%) increase from baseline 500 cells/mm3\n\n(7.5 %)\n492 cells/mm3 \n\n(7.8 %)\nVirologic failure  Week 24 Week 48\n\nNon-responder 0 0 \nRebounder 0 4\nNumber with genotype available* 0 2\n\n*One patient had a mutation at the 155 position.\n\n \n\n\n\n68\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nAs demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, \nraltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and \nCmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases \ndose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose \nproportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established \nin patients.\n\nWith twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the \nfirst 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight \naccumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.\n\nRaltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to \nfood in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple \ndoses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically \nmeaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and \nCmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir \nfollowing a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by \n4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and \n52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic \nvariability relative to fasting. \n\nOverall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed \nC12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % \nand the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in \nco-administration with food and concomitant medicines.\n\nDistribution\n\nRaltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to \n10 \u00b5M. \nRaltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable \nextent.\n\nIn two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was \nreadily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid \nconcentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second \nstudy (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower \nthan the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation and excretion\n\nThe apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life \n(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled \nraltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In \nfaeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of \nraltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely \nraltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and \n23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented \napproximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for \nby raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the \n\n \n\n\n\n69\n\nformation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of \nraltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.\n\nUGT1A1 Polymorphism\nIn a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the \ngeometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr\nwas 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 \nactivity due to genetic polymorphism.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules \nfor oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, \nadministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, \n62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state. \nAdministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics \nto a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. \nThe effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.\n\nTable 8 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet, the chewable tablet), and the \ngranules for oral suspension, by body weight.\n\nTable 8\nRaltegravir Pharmacokinetic Parameters IMPAACT P1066 Following Administration of Doses \nin Section 4.2 (excluding neonates)\n\nBody weight Formulation Dose N*\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nAUC0-12hr (\u03bcM\u25cfhr)\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nC12hr (nM)\n\n\u2265 25 kg\nFilm-coated \n\ntablet 400 mg twice daily 18 14.1 (121 %) 233 (157 %)\n\n\u2265 25 kg Chewable tablet\nWeight based dosing, see \n\ndosing Table 1 9 22.1 (36 %) 113 (80 %)\n\n11 to less than \n25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing Table 2 13 18.6 (68 %) 82 (123 %)\n\n3 to less than \n20 kg Oral suspension\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing table for granules \n\nfor oral suspension 19 24.5 (43 %) 113 (69 %)\n*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose.\n\u2020Geometric coefficient of variation.\n\nElderly\nThere was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects \nand patients with HIV-1 infection over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over \nthe age of 65).\n\nGender, race and BMI\nThere were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass \nindex (BMI) in adults.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there \nwere no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal \ninsufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.\n\n \n\n\n\n70\n\nHepatic impairment\nRaltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically \nimportant pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and \nhealthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has \nnot been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with \nraltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical \nexposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.\n\nMutagenicity\n\nNo evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) \ntests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal \naberration studies.\n\nCarcinogenicity\n\nA carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest \ndose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to \nthat at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the \nnose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in \nmales. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the \nnose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is \nlikely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure \nwas similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate \nmutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity\n\nRaltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase \nin incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat \nfoetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice \ndaily based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg \ntwice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nISENTRESS 100 mg granules for oral suspension\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach sachet contains 100 mg of raltegravir (as potassium). Following reconstitution the oral \nsuspension has a concentration of 10 mg per mL.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach sachet contains approximately: 0.5 mg fructose, 1.5 mg sorbitol and 4.7 mg sucrose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nGranules for oral suspension.\nWhite to off-white, granular powder that may contain yellow or beige to tan particles, in a single-use \nsachet.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the \ntreatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nBecause the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the granules for oral \nsuspension nor the chewable tablets should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see \nsection 5.2). The granules for oral suspension and the chewable tablets have not been studied in \nHIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.\n\nNeonates, Infants and Toddlers \nDosing is weight based from birth as specified in Table 1 and Table 2. Patients can remain on the \ngranules for oral suspension as long as their weight is below 20 kg.\nFor patients weighing between 11 and 20 kg, either the granules for oral suspension or the chewable \ntablet can be used as specified in Table 1 (see section 5.2). Refer to the chewable tablet SmPC for \nadditional dosing information.\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight \n(<2000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing \nrecommendations can be made.  \n\n \n\n\n\n74\n\nTable 1\nRecommended Dose* for ISENTRESS Granules For Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets in \nPaediatric Patients at least 4 weeks of age and weighing 3 to 25 kg\n\nBody Weight\n(kg)\n\nVolume (Dose) of \nSuspension\n\nto be Administered\n\nNumber of Chewable \nTablets\n\n3 to less than 4 2.5 mL (25 mg) twice daily\n4 to less than 6 3 mL (30 mg) twice daily\n6 to less than 8 4 mL (40 mg) twice daily\n\n8 to less than 11 6 mL (60 mg) twice daily\n11 to less than 14\u2020 8 mL (80 mg) twice daily 3 x 25 mg twice daily\n14 to less than 20\u2020 10 mL (100 mg) twice daily 1 x 100 mg twice daily\n20 to less than 25 1.5 x 100 mg\u2021 twice daily\n\n*The weight-based dosing recommendation for the chewable tablet, and oral \nsuspension in 10mL of water is based on approximately 6 mg/kg/dose twice daily \n(see section 5.2.)\n\u2020For weight between 11 and 20 kg either formulation can be used.\nNote: The chewable tablets are available as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets.\n\u2021The 100 mg chewable tablet can be divided into equal halves.\n\nTable 2\nRecommended Dose for ISENTRESS For Oral Suspension in Full-Term Neonates (Birth to \n4 weeks [28 days] of age*\n\nNote: If the mother has taken ISENTRESS 2-24 hours before delivery, the infant\u2019s first dose should be \ngiven between 24-48 hours after birth.\n\nBody Weight\n(kg)\n\nVolume (Dose) of Suspension\nto be Administered\n\nBirth to 1 Week - Once daily dosing\u2020 \n\n2 to less than 3 0.4 mL (4 mg) once daily\n3 to less than 4 0.5 mL (5 mg) once daily\n4 to less than 5 0.7 mL (7 mg) once daily\n\n1 to 4 Weeks - Twice daily dosing\u2021\n\n2 to less than 3 0.8 mL (8 mg) twice daily\n3 to less than 4 1 mL (10 mg) twice daily\n4 to less than 5 1.5 mL (15 mg) twice daily\n\n*No data are available in pre-term neonates.

For patients weighing at least 25 kg but are unable to \nswallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet. Refer to the 400 mg and chewable tablet SmPCs for \nadditional dosing information.\n\nISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg \ntablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) for treatment-na\u00efve patients or \npatients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. \nRefer to the 600 mg tablet SmPCs for additional dosing information.\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore \nISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety \nand efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. \nTherefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nISENTRESS granules for oral suspension can be administered with or without food (see section 5.2).\n\nFor details on preparation and administration of the suspension, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nPatients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been \nproven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact. While effective viral \nsuppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual \ntransmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken \nin accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRaltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir \nshould be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological failure \nand the development of resistance (see section 5.1).\n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in \ncombination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate).\n\n \n\n\n\n76\n\nDepression\n\nDepression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with \na pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a \npre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver \ndisorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.\n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nanti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches \nand pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination anti-\nretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nAntacids\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced \nraltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids \nis not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nRifampicin\n\nCaution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of \nraltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with \nrifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are \nno data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see \nsection 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n77\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).\n\nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions\n\nSevere, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking \nraltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. \nThese include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity\nreactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and \nsometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect \nagents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop \n(including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, \nmuscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, \nangioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate \ntherapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of \nsevere rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.\n\nRash\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nraltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir \nwithout raltegravir (see section 4.8).\n\nFructose/Sucrose\n\nISENTRESS granules for oral suspension contain fructose, sorbitol and sucrose. Patients with rare \nhereditary problems of fructose intolerance glucosegalactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase \ninsufficiency should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit \nUDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the \npharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.\n\nBased on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a \nUGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.\n\nConsiderable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of \nraltegravir. \n\nEffect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\n\nIn interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, \nmidazolam or boceprevir. \n\nIn some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of \nraltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.\n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir\n\nGiven that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when \nco-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces \nplasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the efficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if \nco-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be \nconsidered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in \npatients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug \nmetabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent \ninducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, \npioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 \ninhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors \n(e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent \ncompared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of \nraltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown (see Table 3). From the clinical trials, a \nlarge proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that \nresult in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety \nprofile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was generally \nsimilar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore, no dose adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir \nabsorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and \nmagnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir \nplasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium \ncontaining antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate \nantacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically \nmeaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing \nantacids no dose adjustment is required.\n\nCo-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and \nfamotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of \nraltegravir (see Table 3). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton \npump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. \nTherefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.\n\nAll interaction studies were performed in adults.\n\nTable 3\nPharmacokinetic Interaction Data\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTI-RETROVIRAL\nProtease inhibitors (PI)\n\natazanavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 41 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 77 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 24 %\n\n(UGT1A1 inhibition)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\n \n\n\n\n79\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\ntipranavir /ritonavir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 24 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 55 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 18 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nefavirenz\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 36 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 21 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 36 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir.\n\netravirine\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 10 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 34 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 11 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\netravirine AUC \uf0ad 10 %\netravirine C12hr \uf0ad 17 %\netravirine Cmax \uf0ad 4 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or etravirine.\n\nNucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 49 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0ad 3 %\nraltegravir Cmax \u2191 64 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\ntenofovir AUC \uf0af 10 %\ntenofovir C24hr \uf0af 13 %\ntenofovir Cmax \u2193 23 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate.\n\nCCR5 inhibitors\nmaraviroc\n(raltegravir 400 mg Twice Daily)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 37 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 28 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 33 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nmaraviroc AUC \uf0af 14 %\nmaraviroc C12hr \uf0af 10 %\nmaraviroc Cmax \u2193 21 %\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or maraviroc.\n\nHCV ANTIVIRALS\nNS3/4A protease inhibitors (PI)\n\nboceprevir\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0ad 4 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 25 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0ad 11 %\n\n(mechanism of interaction \nunknown)\n\nNo dose adjustment required \nfor raltegravir or boceprevir.\n\n \n\n\n\n80\n\nMedicinal products by therapeutic \narea\n\nInteraction\n(mechanism, if known)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTIMICROBIALS\nAntimycobacterial\n\nrifampicin\n(raltegravir 400 mg Single Dose)\n\nraltegravir AUC \uf0af 40 %\nraltegravir C12hr \uf0af 61 %\nraltegravir Cmax \uf0af 38 %\n\n(UGT1A1 induction)\n\nRifampicin reduces plasma \nlevels of raltegravir.

A \nmoderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300 \u2013 1,000 pregnancy outcomes from first \ntrimester exposure) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of raltegravir 400 mg \nfilm-coated tablets twice daily. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\nRaltegravir granules for oral suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit \njustifies the potential risk to the foetus. See section 4.2 for dosing recommendations.\n\nAnti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry\nTo monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, \nan Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register \npatients in this registry.\n\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in \norder to characterise the safety for the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in \nmilk (for details see section 5.3).\n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nRaltegravir should not be used during breast-feeding. As a general rule, it is recommended that \nmothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their babies in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\n \n\n\n\n82\n\nFertility\n\nNo effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in \n3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir.\nDizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with\nfixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-na\u00efve (N=547) and treatment-\nexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-na\u00efve adults have received \nraltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to \n96 weeks. See section 5.1. \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and \nabdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution \nsyndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less \nin clinical trials. \n\nRhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of \nraltegravir 400 mg twice daily.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in \ncombination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience, \nare listed below by System Organ Class.

reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-na\u00efve patients who initiated raltegravir \nin conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specific cancers were those \nexpected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was \nsimilar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.\n\n \n\n\n\n85\n\nGrade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. \nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal \nproducts associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nFor each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital \nherpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, \ngastritis, hepatitis, renal failure, accidental overdose.\n\nIn clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more \ncommonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing \nraltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to \nbe drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nIn clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-infected with hepatitis C, \nand 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination \nwith other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B \nand/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or \nhepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat \nhigher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nAt 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that \nrepresent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and \n13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % \nof all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-na\u00efve patients, Grade 2 or \nhigher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total \nbilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with \nraltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChildren and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age\nRaltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and \nadolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.\n\nIn these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, \nabnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic \nrash.\n\n \n\n\n\n86\n\nOne patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which \nwere considered serious.\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nRaltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than \n2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 \nand 5.2).\n\nIn these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions \nthrough Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.\n\nOne patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment \ndiscontinuation.\n\nHIV-1 Exposed Neonates\nIn IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg \nin weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and \n26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug \nrelated clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a \ntransient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to \nchild transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered \nnon-serious and not requiring specific therapy). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with raltegravir.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an \nelectrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that \nraltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX08.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRaltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is \nrequired for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of \nthe HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the \nproduction of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral \ninfection.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n87\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nRaltegravir at concentrations of 31 \uf0b1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of HIV-1 replication \n(relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the \ncell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of \nmitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical \nisolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited \ninfection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with \nIC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. \n\nResistance\n\nMost viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting \nfrom the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino \nacid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 \n(Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, \nE92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral \nsusceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir \nsusceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline \nviral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir \ngenerally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at \namino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation \nconfers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino \nacid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically \nsignificant resistance to dolutegravir.\n\nClinical experience\n\nThe evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, \nProtocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the \nanalysis of 240-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, \nProtocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients.\n\nEfficacy\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\nBENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntrials) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a \ncombination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, \nwith documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of \nanti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the \npatient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.\n\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median \nof 12 anti-retrovirals for a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT. \n\nResults 48 week and 96 week analyses\nDurable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg \ntwice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 3.\n\n \n\n\n\n88\n\nTable 4\nEfficacy Outcome at Weeks 48 and 96\n\nBENCHMRK 1 and 2 Pooled\n\nParameter\n\n48 Weeks 96 Weeks\n\nRaltegravir \n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + \nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nRaltegravir \n400 mg twice \ndaily + OBT\n\n(N = 462)\n\nPlacebo + \nOBT\n\n(N = 237)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL (95 % CI) \n       All patients\u2020 72 (68, 76) 37 (31, 44) 62 (57, 66) 28 (23, 34)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 62 (53, 69) 17 (9, 27) 53 (45, 61) 15 (8, 25)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 82 (77, 86) 49 (41, 58) 74 (69, 79) 39 (31, 47)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 61 (53, 69) 21 (13, 32) 51 (42, 60) 14 (7, 24)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 80 (73, 85) 44 (33, 55) 70 (62, 77) 36 (25, 48)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 83 (76, 89) 51 (39, 63) 78 (70, 85) 42 (30, 55)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 52 (42, 61) 8 (3, 17)  46 (36, 56) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 81 (75, 87) 40 (30, 51) 76 (69, 83) 31 (22, 42)\n                                  2 and above 84 (77, 89) 65 (52, 76) 71 (63, 78) 56 (43, 69)\n\nPercent HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL (95 % CI)\n       All patients\u2020 62 (57, 67) 33 (27, 39) 57 (52, 62) 26 (21, 32)\n\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 48 (40, 56) 16 (8, 26) 47 (39, 55) 13 (7, 23)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 73 (68, 78) 43 (35, 52) 70 (64, 75) 36 (28, 45)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 50 (41, 58) 20 (12, 31) 50 (41, 58) 13 (6, 22)\n                                 > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 67 (59, 74) 39 (28, 50) 65 (57, 72) 32 (22, 44)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 76 (68, 83) 44 (32, 56) 71 (62, 78) 41 (29, 53)\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 45 (35, 54) 3 (0, 11) 41 (32, 51) 5 (1, 13)\n                                  1 67 (59, 74) 37 (27, 48) 72 (64, 79) 28 (19, 39)\n                                  2 and above 75 (68, 82) 59 (46, 71) 65 (56, 72) 53 (40, 66)\n\nMean CD4 Cell Change (95 % CI), cells/mm3\n\n       All patients\u2021 109 (98, 121) 45 (32, 57) 123 (110, 137) 49 (35, 63)\n           Baseline Characteristic\u2021\n\n               HIV-RNA > 100,000 copies/mL 126 (107, 144) 36 (17, 55) 140 (115, 165) 40 (16, 65)\n                                  \u2264 100,000 copies/mL 100 (86, 115) 49 (33, 65) 114 (98, 131) 53 (36, 70)\n               CD4-count \u2264 50 cells/mm3 121 (100, 142) 33 (18, 48) 130 (104, 156) 42 (17, 67)\n                                  > 50 and \u2264 200 cells/mm3 104 (88, 119) 47 (28, 66) 123 (103, 144) 56 (34, 79)\n                                  > 200 cells/mm3 104 (80, 129) 54 (24, 84) 117 (90, 143) 48 (23, 73)\n\n                Sensitivity score (GSS) \u00a7\n\n                                  0 81 (55, 106) 11 (4, 26) 97 (70, 124) 15 (-0, 31)\n                                  1 113 (96, 130) 44 (24, 63) 132 (111, 154) 45 (24, 66)\n                                 2 and above 125 (105, 144) 76 (48, 103) 134 (108, 159) 90 (57, 123)\n\n\u2020 Non-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed as failure thereafter.

For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carry-\nforward was used for virologic failures.\n\n\u00a7 The Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate \nshowed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in \nOBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-na\u00efve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.\n\n \n\n\n\n89\n\nRaltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. \nSome patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with \nfailure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.\n\nSwitch to raltegravir\nThe SWITCHMRK 1 & 2 (Protocols 032 & 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving \nsuppressive (screening HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL; stable regimen > 3 months) therapy with lopinavir \n200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and \nn=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and \nn=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the \nnumber of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited. \n\nThese studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to \ndemonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, \nsuppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group \nversus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 \nregarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adult patients\nSTARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and \nanti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a \ncombination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected \npatients with HIV RNA > 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA \nlevel (\u2264 50,000 copies/mL; and > 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or \nnegative).\nPatient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the \ngroup receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.\n\nResults 48-week and 240-week analyses\nWith respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA\n< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 \n(81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz.

This study enrolled \n126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Patients were stratified by \nage, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the \n400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than \n12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.\n\nThe initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based \nupon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and \nacceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of \nlong term safety, tolerability and efficacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of \nraltegravir (see section 4.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n91\n\nTable 6\nBaseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Weeks 24 and 48 from IMPAACT P1066\n(2 to 18 years of age)\n\nParameter\nFinal dose population\n\nN=96\n\nDemographics\nAge (years), median [range] 13 [2 \u2013 18]\nMale Gender 49 %\nRace\n\nCaucasian 34 %\nBlack 59 %\n\nBaseline Characteristics\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL), mean [range] 4.3 [2.7 - 6]\nCD4 cell count (cells/mm3 ), median [range] 481 [0 \u2013 2361]\nCD4 percent, median [range] 23.3 % [0 \u2013 44]\nHIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL 8 %\nCDC HIV category B or C 59 %\n\nPrior ART Use by Class\nNNRTI 78 %\nPI 83 %\n\nResponse Week 24 Week 48\nAchieved \u22651 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline or \n<400 copies/mL 72 % 79 %\nAchieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL 54 % 57 %\nMean CD4 cell count (%) increase from baseline 119 cells/mm3\n\n(3.8 %)\n156 cells/mm3 \n\n(4.6 %)\n\nInfants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age\nIMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age \nwho had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child \ntransmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. \nRaltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in \ncombination with an optimised background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds \nof patients.\n\n \n\n\n\n92\n\nTable 7\nBaseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Weeks 24 and 48 from IMPAACT P1066\n(4 weeks to less than 2 years of age)\n\nParameter N=26\n\nDemographics\nAge (weeks), median [range] 28 [4 -100]\nMale Gender 65 %\nRace\n\nCaucasian 8 %\nBlack 85 %\n\nBaseline Characteristics\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL), mean [range] 5.7 [3.1 - 7]\nCD4 cell count (cells/mm3 ), median [range] 1,400 [131 -3,648]\nCD4 percent, median [range] 18.6 % [3.3 \u2013 39.3]\nHIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL 69 %\nCDC HIV category B or C 23 %\n\nPrior ART Use by Class\nNNRTI 73 %\nNRTI 46%\nPI 19 %\n\nResponse Week 24 Week 48\nAchieved \u22651 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline or \n<400 copies/mL 91 % 85 %\nAchieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL 43 % 53 %\nMean CD4 cell count (%) increase from baseline 500 cells/mm3\n\n(7.5 %)\n492 cells/mm3 \n\n(7.8 %)\nVirologic failure Week 24 Week 48\n\nNon-responder 0 0 \nRebounder 0 4\nNumber with genotype available*  0 2\n\n*One patient had a mutation at the 155 position.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nAs demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, \nraltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and \nCmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases \ndose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose \nproportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established \nin patients.\n\nWith twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the \nfirst 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight \naccumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.\n\nRaltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to \nfood in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple \ndoses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically \nmeaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and \nCmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir \nfollowing a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by \n4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and \n52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic \nvariability relative to fasting. \n\n \n\n\n\n93\n\nOverall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed \nC12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % \nand the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in \nco-administration with food and concomitant medicines.\n\nDistribution\n\nRaltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to \n10 \u00b5M. \nRaltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable \nextent.\n\nIn two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was \nreadily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the first study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal fluid \nconcentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second \nstudy (n=16), the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower \nthan the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation and excretion\n\nThe apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter \u03b1-phase half-life \n(~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled \nraltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In \nfaeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of \nraltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely \nraltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and \n23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented \napproximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for \nby raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the \nformation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of \nraltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.\n\nUGT1A1 Polymorphism\nIn a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the \ngeometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr\nwas 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 \nactivity due to genetic polymorphism.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules \nfor oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, \nadministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, \n62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12 hr compared to administration in the fasted state. \nAdministration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics \nto a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. \nThe effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not studied.\n\n \n\n\n\n94\n\nTable 8 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet, the chewable tablet, and the \ngranules for oral suspension, by body weight.\n\nTable 8\nRaltegravir Pharmacokinetic Parameters IMPAACT P1066 Following Administration of Doses \nin Section 4.2\n\nBody weight Formulation Dose N*\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nAUC0-12hr (\u03bcM\u25cfhr)\n\nGeometric mean\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nC12hr (nM)\n\n\u2265 25 kg\nFilm-coated \n\ntablet 400 mg twice daily 18 14.1 (121 %) 233 (157 %)\n\n\u2265 25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing tables for the \n\nchewable tablet 9 22.1 (36 %) 113 (80 %)\n\n11 to less than \n25 kg Chewable tablet\n\nWeight based dosing, see \ndosing tables for the \n\nchewable tablet 13 18.6 (68 %) 82 (123 %)\n3 to less than \n\n20 kg Oral suspension\nWeight based dosing, see \n\ndosing Table 1 19 24.5 (43 %) 113 (69 %)\n*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose.\n\u2020Geometric coefficient of variation.\n\nHIV-1 Exposed Neonates \nIMPAACT P1110 is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir granules \nfor suspension (GFS) with standard care PMTCT in full term HIV-1-exposed neonates. Cohort 1 \n(N=16, 10 exposed and 6 unexposed to raltegravir in utero) received 2 single doses of raltegravir GFS \n(within 48 hours and 7 - 10 days after birth); Cohort 2 (N=26, all raltegravir unexposed in utero) \nreceived raltegravir GFS for 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through\nWeek 1; 3 mg/kg twice daily Weeks 2 to 4; and 6 mg/kg twice daily Weeks 5 and 6.\n\nTable 9 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates in Cohort 2 at birth and at 2 weeks of age. \nElimination of raltegravir in vivo in human is primarily through the UGT1A1-mediated \nglucuronidation pathway. UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The \ndose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly \nincreasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age.\n\nTable 9: Raltegravir Pharmacokinetic Parameters IMPAACT P1110 Following Age and Weight \nBased Dosing of the Granules for Suspension \n\nAge (hours/days) at PK \n\nSampling Dose (See Table 2) N*\n\nGeometric Mean\n\n(%CV\u2020)\n\nAUC (mg*hr/L)\n\nGeometric Mean\n\n(% CV\u2020)\n\nCtrough (ng/mL)\n\nBirth \u2013 48 hours 1.5 mg/kg once daily 25 38.2 (38.4%)\u2021 947.9 (64.2%) \u2021\n\n15 to 18 days 3.0 mg/kg twice daily 23 14.3 (43.3%) \u00a7 558 (83.7%) \u00a7\n\n*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose.\n\n\u2020Geometric coefficient of variation. \n\n\u2021 AUC0-24hr (N = 24); C24hr \n\n\u00a7AUC0-12hr; C12hr\n\nElderly\nThere was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects \nand patients with HIV-1 infection, over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals\nover the age of 65).\n\n \n\n\n\n95\n\nGender, race and BMI\nThere were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass \nindex (BMI) in adults.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there \nwere no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal \ninsufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be \ndialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.\n\nHepatic impairment\nRaltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically \nimportant pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and \nhealthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has \nnot been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with \nraltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Effects at exposure levels sufficiently in excess of clinical \nexposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.\n\nMutagenicity\n\nNo evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) \ntests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal \naberration studies.\n\nCarcinogenicity\n\nA carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest \ndose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to \nthat at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the \nnose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in \nmales. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the \nnose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is \nlikely that it is of limited relevance for the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure \nwas similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate \nmutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity\n\nRaltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase \nin incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat \nfoetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice \ndaily based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg \ntwice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.\n\n \n\n\n\n96\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n \n\n\n\n122\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nIsentress 400 mg film-coated tablets\nraltegravir\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\nIf you are the parent of a child taking Isentress, please read this information carefully with your \nchild.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may \n\nharm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Isentress is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Isentress\n3. How to take Isentress\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Isentress\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Isentress is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Isentress is\nIsentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against\nthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency \nSyndrome (AIDS).\n\nHow Isentress works\nThe virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in \nyour body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may \nreduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell \ncount (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system \nto help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of \nyour immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. \n\nWhen Isentress should be used\nIsentress is used to treat those who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help \ncontrol your HIV infection.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Isentress\n\nDo not take Isentress:\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.\nRemember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while \ntaking this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n123\n\nMental health problems\nTell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including \nsuicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly \nin patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the \nactivity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk \nfactors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nLiver problems\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including \nhepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake this medicine.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still \npass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral \ntherapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nInfections\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as \nfever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nMuscle problems\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, \ntenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.\n\nSkin problems\nContact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and \nallergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.\n\nOther medicines and Isentress\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \nwith or without a prescription.\n\nIsentress might interact with other medicines.\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:\n\uf0b7 Antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion \n\nand heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing \naluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.\n\n \n\n\n\n124\n\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease \nyour levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are \ntaking rifampicin.\n\nTaking Isentress with food and drink\nSee section 3.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\n\uf0b7 Women with HIV should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with HIV \nthrough their breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.\n\nIsentress film-coated tablets contain lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Isentress\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with \nother medicines for HIV.\n\nHow much to take\nAdults\nThe recommended dose is 1 tablet (400 mg) by mouth twice a day.\n\nUse in children and adolescents\nThe recommended dose of Isentress is 400 mg by mouth, twice a day for adolescents and children \nweighing at least 25 kg.\n\nDo not chew, crush or split the tablets because it may change the level of medicine in your body. This \nmedicine can be taken with or without food or drink.\n\nIsentress is also available in a 600 mg tablet, a chewable tablet and in granules for oral suspension. \nDo not switch between the 400 mg tablet, the 600 mg tablet, chewable tablet or granules for oral \nsuspension without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nIf you take more Isentress than you should\nDo not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your \ndoctor.\n\nIf you forget to take Isentress\n\uf0b7 If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.\n\uf0b7 However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular \n\nschedule. \n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n \n\n\n\n125\n\nIf you stop taking Isentress\nIt is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or \nstop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop \ntaking it because:\n\uf0b7 It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. \n\nThis can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will \nstop being able to fight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").\n\n\uf0b7 When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy.

What you need to know before you take Isentress\n3. How to take Isentress\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Isentress\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Isentress is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Isentress is\nIsentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against\nthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency \nSyndrome (AIDS).\n\nHow Isentress works\nThe virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in \nyour body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may \nreduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell \ncount (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system \nto help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of \nyour immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. \n\nWhen Isentress should be used\nIsentress 600 mg film-coated tablets is used to treat adults and paediatric patients weighing at least \n40 kg who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help control your HIV \ninfection.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Isentress\n\nDo not take Isentress:\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\n \n\n\n\n130\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.\nRemember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while \ntaking this medicine.\n\nMental health problems\nTell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including \nsuicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly \nin patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the \nactivity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk \nfactors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nLiver problems\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including \nhepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake this medicine.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still \npass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral \ntherapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nInfections\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as \nfever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nMuscle problems\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, \ntenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.\n\nSkin problems\nContact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and \nallergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.\n\nOther medicines and Isentress\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\n \n\n\n\n131\n\nIsentress might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, \nhave recently taken or might take:\n\n\uf0b7 antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion \nand heartburn)\n\n\uf0b7 atazanavir (an antiretroviral medication)\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n\uf0b7 tipranavir/ritonavir (antiretroviral medicines)\n\nKeep a list of all your medicines to show your doctor and pharmacist.\n\uf0b7 You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with Isentress.  \n\uf0b7 Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your doctor. Your doctor can tell you if it is \n\nsafe to take Isentress with other medicines.\n\nTaking Isentress with food and drink\nSee section 3.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\uf0b7 Isentress 1,200 mg (two 600 mg tablets once daily) is not recommended in pregnancy because it \n\nhas not been studied in pregnant women.\n\uf0b7 Women with HIV should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with HIV \n\nthrough their breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.\n\nIsentress film-coated tablets contain lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Isentress\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with \nother medicines for HIV.\n\nHow much to take\nAdults, children and adolescents weighing at least 40 kg\nThe recommended dose is 1,200 mg taken as two 600 mg tablets taken by mouth once a day.\n\nDo not chew, crush or split the tablets because it may change the level of medicine in your body. This \nmedicine can be taken with or without food or drink.\n\nIsentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a chewable tablet and in granules for oral suspension.\nDo not switch between the 600 mg tablet, 400 mg tablet, chewable tablet or granules for oral \nsuspension without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nIf you take more Isentress than you should\nDo not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your \ndoctor.\n\n \n\n\n\n132\n\nIf you forget to take Isentress\n\uf0b7 If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. \n\uf0b7 However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular \n\nschedule. \n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Isentress\nIt is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or \nstop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\nDo not stop taking it because:\n\uf0b7 It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. \n\nThis can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will \nstop being able to fight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").\n\n\uf0b7 When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is \nbecause it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short \nbreak in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean \nthat the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.

What Isentress is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Isentress is\nIsentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against\nthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency \nSyndrome (AIDS).\n\nHow Isentress works\nThe virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in \nyour body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may \nreduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell \ncount (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system \nto help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of \nyour immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. \n\nWhen Isentress should be used\nIsentress is used to treat those who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help \ncontrol your HIV infection.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Isentress\n\nDo not take Isentress\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\n \n\n\n\n138\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.\nRemember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while \ntaking this medicine.\n\nMental health problems\nTell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including \nsuicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly \nin patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the \nactivity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk \nfactors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor. \n\nLiver problems\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including \nhepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake this medicine.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still \npass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral \ntherapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nInfections\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as \nfever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nMuscle problems\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, \ntenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.\n\nSkin problems\nContact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and \nallergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n139\n\nOther medicines and Isentress\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \nwith or without a prescription.\n\nIsentress might interact with other medicines.\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:\n\uf0b7 antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion \n\nand heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing \naluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.\n\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease \nyour levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are \ntaking rifampicin.\n\nTaking Isentress with food and drink\nSee section 3.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\uf0b7 Isentress chewable tablets are not recommended in pregnancy because they have not been \n\nstudied in pregnant women. \n\uf0b7 Women with HIV should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with HIV \n\nthrough their breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.\n\nIsentress chewable tablets contain fructose and sorbitol\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nSweeteners contained in this medicine may be harmful to teeth.\n\nIsentress chewable tablets contain aspartame\nIsentress contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful to people with \nphenylketonuria.\n\n3. How to take Isentress\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with \nother medicines for HIV.\n\nThe 100 mg chewable tablet can be split into equal halves if necessary; however, breaking the tablets \nshould be avoided.\n\nHow much to take\nDose for children of 2 through 11 years of age\nThe doctor will work out the right dose of the chewable tablet based on the age and weight of the \nchild. This dose must not exceed 300 mg twice a day. The doctor will tell you how many chewable \ntablets the child must take.\n\nIsentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a 600 mg tablet and in granules for oral suspension.\nDo not switch between the chewable tablet, granules for oral suspension, 600 mg tablet or 400 mg \n\n \n\n\n\n140\n\ntablet without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nChildren should keep scheduled doctor\u2019s visits because their Isentress dosage should be adjusted as \nthey get older, grow or gain weight. Their doctor may also want to prescribe the 400 mg tablet when \nthey are able to swallow a tablet.\n\nYou can take this medicine with or without food or drink.\n\nIf you take more Isentress than you should\nDo not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your \ndoctor.\n\nIf you forget to take Isentress\n\uf0b7 If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. \n\uf0b7 However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular \n\nschedule. \n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Isentress\nIt is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or \nstop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop \ntaking it because:\n\uf0b7 It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. \n\nThis can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will \nstop being able to fight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").\n\n\uf0b7 When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is \nbecause it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short \nbreak in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean \nthat the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.

You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Instructions for use \u2013 see the booklet for how to prepare and give the medicine\n\n1. What Isentress is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Isentress is\nIsentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against\nthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency \nSyndrome (AIDS).\n\nHow Isentress works\nThe virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in \nyour body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may \nreduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell \ncount (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system \nto help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of \nyour immune system. This means your body may fight infection better. \n\nWhen Isentress should be used\nIsentress is used to treat adults, adolescents, children, toddlers and infants who are infected by HIV\nand to treat newborn babies exposed to HIV-1 infection from the mother. Your doctor has prescribed \nIsentress to help control your HIV infection.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Isentress\n\nDo not take Isentress\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6.).\n\n \n\n\n\n146\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.\nRemember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while \ntaking this medicine.\n\nMental health problems\nTell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including \nsuicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly \nin patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the \nactivity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk \nfactors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor. \n\nLiver problems\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including \nhepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake this medicine.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still \npass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral \ntherapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nInfections\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as \nfever, and/or feeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nMuscle problems\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, \ntenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.\n\nSkin problems\nContact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and \nallergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n147\n\nOther medicines and Isentress\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \nwith or without a prescription.\n\nIsentress might interact with other medicines. \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:\n\uf0b7 antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion \n\nand heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing \naluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.\n\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease \nyour levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are\ntaking rifampicin.\n\nTaking Isentress with food and drink\nSee section 3.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\uf0b7 Isentress granules for oral suspension are not recommended in pregnancy because they have not \n\nbeen studied in pregnant women.\n\uf0b7 Women with HIV should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with HIV \n\nthrough their breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine.\n\nIsentress granules for oral suspension contain fructose, sorbitol and sucrose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nSweeteners contained in this medicine may be harmful to teeth.\n\n3. How to take Isentress\n\nAlways give this medicine to your child exactly as their doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You \nshould check with your child\u2019s doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used \nin combination with other medicines for HIV.\n\uf0b7 See the instructions for use in the booklet for how to prepare and give a dose of Isentress. Keep \n\nthe booklet and follow it each time you prepare the medicine.  Bring this booklet to your child\u2019s \nappointments. \n\n\uf0b7 Make sure the doctor, pharmacist or nurse explains how to mix and give the right dose to your \nchild. \n\n\uf0b7 The granules need to be mixed with water before use. You must give to your child within \n30 minutes of mixing.\n\n\uf0b7 The dose will change over time. Make sure to follow the instructions of your doctor. The doctor \nwill tell you if and when to stop giving Isentress to your baby.\n\nHow much to take\nThe doctor will work out the right dose of granules for oral suspension based on the age and weight of \nthe infant or toddler. The doctor will tell you how much of the oral suspension the infant or toddler \nmust take.\nYour child can take this medicine with or without food or drink.\n\n \n\n\n\n148\n\nIsentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a 600 mg tablet and in a chewable tablet.\nDo not switch between the granules for oral suspension, chewable tablet, 600 mg tablet or 400 mg \ntablet without first talking to your child\u2019s doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nChildren should keep scheduled doctor\u2019s visits because their Isentress dosage should be adjusted as \nthey get older, grow or gain weight. Their doctor may also want to prescribe the chewable tablet when \nthey are able to chew a tablet.\n\nIf you take more Isentress than you should\nDo not take more Isentress than the doctor recommends. If you do take more than you should, contact \nyour doctor.\n\nIf you forget to take Isentress\n\uf0b7 If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.\n\uf0b7 However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular \n\nschedule. \n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Isentress\nIt is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or \nstop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop \ntaking it because:\n\uf0b7 It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. \n\nThis can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will \nstop being able to fight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").\n\n\uf0b7 When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is \nbecause it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short \nbreak in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean \nthat the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.

Mix Isentress and water\n\nSnap the lid of the mixing cup shut.\nGently swirl the mixing cup for\n45 seconds in a circular motion to \nmix the granules and water. Use a \nclock or timer to time for 45 seconds. \nDO NOT SHAKE the mixture\n\nTake 1 sachet of ISENTRESS and \nshake the granules to the bottom of \nthe sachet.\n\nRe-check the amount of water in the \nsyringe. If it is less than 10 mL, put the tip \nback into the water and pull back on the \nplunger until you get to the 10 mL mark.\n\n \n\n\n\n157\n\nCheck to make sure the granules are mixed. \nIf it is not mixed, swirl it some more. \nThe mixture should look cloudy.\n\nStep 8. Check your prescription\n\nUse the dose amount in \u2018mL\u2019 prescribed by the doctor.\n\nRemember that the dose may change each time you go to the doctor, so make sure you have all the \nrecent information. Be sure to go to all of your doctor\u2019s appointments so your child gets the right dose!\n\nStep 9. Choose the syringe you need \n\nChoose the correct syringe for your child\u2019s dose:\n\nWHITE GREEN BLUE\n(1 mL) (3 mL) (10 mL)\nfor 1 mL or less for 1.5 mL to 3 mL for 3.5 mL to 10 mL\n\nMove this part of \nthe plunger\nto the correct mark\non the syringe\n\nThen find the mL mark on the syringe barrel that matches your child\u2019s dose.\n\nStep 10. Measure Isentress\n\nPush the plunger into the barrel \nof the syringe as far as it goes.\n\n \n\n\n\n158\n\nPut the tip of the syringe into \nthe cup of the prepared Isentress and pull back \non the plunger.\n\nStop when you get to the line \nthat matches your child\u2019s \nprescribed dose.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\u2022 Your child\u2019s dose may be different from the one shown in this figure.\n\u2022 There will usually be some leftover, prepared Isentress in the mixing cup.\n\nStep 11. Check for air bubbles\n\nHold the syringe with tip up.\nTap it with your finger \nto move any air bubbles up.\n\nSlowly push the plunger to make the air come out.\n.\n\nRe-check the amount of Isentress in the syringe. \nIf it is less than the prescribed dose, put the tip back into the cup of prepared Isentress and pull back on \nthe plunger until you get to the right dose mark.\n\nStep 12. Give Isentress to your baby\n\nPlace the tip of the syringe \ninside your child\u2019s mouth so \nthat it touches either the right \nor left cheek.\n\nSlowly push in the plunger to give the prepared Isentress. If your child fusses, take the tip of the \nsyringe out of the mouth and try again. It is important that your child takes all of the prescribed dose \n(a little left in the syringe tip is OK).\n\n \n\n\n\n159\n\nIMPORTANT: If your child does not take all of the prescribed dose or spits some of it out, call \nyour doctor to find out what to do.\n\nStep 13. Clean up\n\nPour the leftover prepared Isentress into the rubbish.\nDo not pour it into the sink.\n\nPull the plungers out of any syringes you used.\n\nHand wash the syringes, plungers, and mixing cup \nwith warm water and dishwashing soap. \nDo not wash in the dishwasher.\n\nRinse with water and air dry.\nPut everything in a clean, dry place.\n\nHow should I store Isentress?\n\nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture.\nDo not open the Isentress sachets until you are ready to prepare a dose.\n\nBe sure to keep your doctor\u2019s appointments so you always know how much Isentress to give.\n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

antiviral medicine that works against the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). this is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). how isentress works the virus produces an enzyme called hiv integrase. this helps the virus to multiply in the cells in your body. isentress stops this enzyme from working. when used with other medicines, isentress may reduce the amount of hiv in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your cd4-cell count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection). reducing the amount of hiv in the blood may improve the functioning of your immune system. this means your body may fight infection better. when isentress should be used isentress is used to treat those who are infected by hiv. your doctor has prescribed isentress to help control your hiv infection.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "isentress", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":

this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking isentress. remember that isentress is not a cure for hiv infection. this means that you may keep getting infections or other illnesses associated with hiv. you should keep seeing your doctor regularly while taking this medicine. mental health problems tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. depression, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness. bone problems some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. liver problems tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis b or c. your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take this medicine. passing hiv to others hiv infection is spread by contact with blood or sexual contact with a person with hiv. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. infections tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as fever, and/or feeling unwell. in some patients with advanced hiv infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. muscle problems contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine. skin problems contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. severe and life-threatening skin reactions and allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine. other medicines and isentress tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines with or without a prescription. isentress might interact with other medicines. tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take: antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion and heartburn). it is not recommended to take isentress with certain antacids (those containing aluminium and/or magnesium). talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take. rifampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease your levels of isentress. your doctor may consider increasing your dose of isentress if you are taking rifampicin. taking isentress with food and drink see section 3. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. women with hiv should not breast-feed their infants because babies can be infected with hiv through their breast milk. talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby. ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. driving and using machines do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy after taking this medicine. isentress film-coated
