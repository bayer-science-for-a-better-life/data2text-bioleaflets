CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSecondary hyperparathyroidism \n \nAdults \nTreatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adult patients with end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \nTreatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in children aged 3 years and older with end-stage \nrenal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy in whom secondary HPT is not adequately \ncontrolled with standard of care therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma may be used as part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders \nand/or Vitamin D sterols, as appropriate (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nParathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism in adults \n \nReduction of hypercalcaemia in adult patients with: \n\n\u2022 parathyroid carcinoma. \n\u2022 primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium \n\nlevels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not \nclinically appropriate or is contraindicated. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSecondary hyperparathyroidism \n \nAdults and elderly (> 65 years) \nThe recommended starting dose for adults is 30 mg once per day. Cinacalcet should be titrated every 2 \nto 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve a target parathyroid hormone (PTH) in \ndialysis patients of between 150-300 pg/mL (15.9-31.8 pmol/L) in the intact PTH (iPTH) assay. PTH \nlevels should be assessed at least 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet. Reference should be made to \ncurrent treatment guidelines. \n \nPTH should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. PTH should be \nmonitored approximately every 1-3 months during maintenance. Either the intact PTH (iPTH) or \nbio-intact PTH (biPTH) may be used to measure PTH levels; treatment with cinacalcet does not alter \nthe relationship between iPTH and biPTH. \n \nDose adjustment based on serum calcium levels \nCorrected serum calcium should be measured and monitored and should be at or above the lower limit \nof the normal range prior to administration of first dose of cinacalcet (see section 4.4). The normal \ncalcium range may differ depending on the methods used by your local laboratory. \n \nDuring dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently, and within 1 week of \ninitiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum \ncalcium should be measured approximately monthly. In the event that corrected serum calcium levels \nfall below 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and/or symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur the following \nmanagement is recommended: \n \n\nCorrected Serum calcium level or clinical \nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nRecommendations \n\n< 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and > 7.5 mg/dL \n(1.9 mmol/L), or in the presence of clinical \nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nCalcium-containing phosphate binders, vitamin D \nsterols and/or adjustment of dialysis fluid calcium \nconcentrations can be used to raise serum calcium \naccording to clinical judgment. \n\n< 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and > 7.5 mg/dL \n(1.9 mmol/L) or persistent symptoms of \nhypocalcaemia despite attempts to increase \nserum calcium \n\nReduce or withhold dose of cinacalcet. \n\n\u2264 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) or persistent \nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia and Vitamin D \ncannot be increased \n\nWithhold administration of cinacalcet until serum \ncalcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) \nand/or \nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia have resolved. \nTreatment should be reinitiated using the next \n\n     \nPaediatric population \n \nCorrected serum calcium should be in the upper range of, or above, the age-specified reference \ninterval prior to administration of first dose of cinacalcet, and closely monitored (see section 4.4). The \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nnormal calcium range differs depending on the methods used by your local laboratory and the age of \nthe child/patient. \n \nThe recommended starting dose for children aged \u2265 3 years to < 18 years is \u2264 0.20 mg/kg once daily \nbased on the patient\u2019s dry weight (see table 1). \n \nThe dose can be increased to achieve a desired target iPTH range. The dose should be increased \nsequentially through available dose levels (see table 1) no more frequently than every 4 weeks. The \ndose can be increased up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day, not to exceed a total daily dose of 180 \nmg. \n\nTable 1. Cinacalcet daily dose in paediatric patients \n \n\n \nPatient dry weight (kg) \n\n \nStarting dose (mg) \n\nAvailable sequential dose \nlevels (mg) \n\n10 to < 12.5 1 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 \n\u2265 12.5 to < 25 2.5 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 30 \n\u2265 25 to < 36  \n\n5 \n5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 \n\n\u2265 36 to < 50 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 90 \n\u2265 50 to < 75 10 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 \n\u2265 75 15 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 \n\n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma is only available as film-coated tablet. Thus, it is not possible to administer \ncinacalcet Accordpharma to paediatric patients that require less than a full 30 mg dose. If an alternate \ndose is required, other cinacalcet products offering such an option should be used. \n \nDose adjustment based on PTH levels \nPTH levels should be assessed at least 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet and iPTH should be \nmeasured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. \n \nThe dose should be adjusted based on iPTH as shown below: \n\n\u2022 If iPTH is < 150 pg/mL (15.9 pmol/L) and \u2265 100 pg/mL (10.6 pmol/L), decrease the dose of \ncinacalcet to the next lower dose. \n\n\u2022 If iPTH < 100 pg/mL (10.6 pmol/L), stop cinacalcet treatment, restart cinacalcet at the next \nlower dose once the iPTH is > 150 pg/mL (15.9 pmol/L). If cinacalcet treatment has been \nstopped for more than 14 days, restart at the recommended starting dose. \n\n \nDose adjustment based on serum calcium levels \nSerum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. \n \nOnce the maintenance dose has been established, weekly measurement of serum calcium is \nrecommended. Serum calcium levels in paediatric patients should be maintained within the normal \nrange. If serum calcium levels decrease below the normal range or symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur, \nappropriate dose adjustment steps should be taken as shown in table 2 below: \n \n\nTable 2. Dose adjustment in paediatric patients \u2265 3 to < 18 years of age \n \n\nCorrected Serum calcium value or \nclinical symptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nDosing recommendations \n\nCorrected serum calcium is at or below \nage-specified lower limit of normal or \nif symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur, \nregardless of calcium level. \n\nStop treatment with cinacalcet.* \n \nAdminister calcium supplements, calcium-containing \nphosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols, as clinically \nindicated. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nCorrected Serum calcium value or \nclinical symptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nDosing recommendations \n\nCorrected total serum calcium is above \nage-specified lower limit of normal, and \n \nSymptoms of hypocalcaemia have \nresolved. \n\nRestart at the next lower dose. If cinacalcet treatment has \nbeen stopped for more than 14 days, restart at the \nrecommended starting dose. \n \nIf patient was receiving the lowest dose (1 mg/day) prior \nto discontinuation, restart at the same dose (1 mg/day). \n\n*If the dose has been stopped, corrected serum calcium should be measured within 5 to 7 days \n \nThe safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in children aged less than 3 years for the treatment of secondary \nhyperparathyroidism have not been established. Insufficient data are available. \n \nSwitch from etelcalcetide to Cinacalcet Accordpharma \n \nThe switch from etelcalcetide to Cinacalcet Accordpharma and the appropriate wash out period has \nnot been studied in patients. In patients who have discontinued etelcalcetide, Cinacalcet \nAccordpharma should not be initiated until at least three subsequent haemodialysis sessions have been \ncompleted, at which time serum calcium should be measured. Ensure serum calcium levels are within \nthe normal range before Cinacalcet Accordpharma is initiated (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nParathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism \n \nAdults and elderly (> 65 years) \nThe recommended starting dose of cinacalcet for adults is 30 mg twice per day. The dose of cinacalcet \nshould be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice \ndaily, 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg three or four times daily as necessary to reduce serum calcium \nconcentration to or below the upper limit of normal. The maximum dose used in clinical trials was \n90 mg four times daily. \n \nSerum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. \nOnce maintenance dose levels have been established, serum calcium should be measured every \n2 to 3 months. After titration to the maximum dose of cinacalcet, serum calcium should be periodically \nmonitored; if clinically relevant reductions in serum calcium are not maintained, discontinuation of \ncinacalcet therapy should be considered (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in children for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma and \nprimary hyperparathyroidism have not been established. No data are available. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo change in starting dose is necessary. Cinacalcet should be used with caution in patients with \nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment and treatment should be closely monitored during dose titration \nand continued treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \nTablets should be taken whole and should not be chewed, crushed or divided. \n \nIt is recommended that cinacalcet be taken with food or shortly after a meal, as studies have shown \nthat bioavailability of cinacalcet is increased when taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nHypocalcaemia (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSerum calcium \n \nLife threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcaemia have been reported in adult \nand paediatric patients treated with cinacalcet. Manifestations of hypocalcaemia may include \nparaesthesias, myalgias, cramping, tetany and convulsions. Decreases in serum calcium can also \nprolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia. \nCases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with \ncinacalcet (see section 4.8). Caution is advised in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation \nsuch as patients with known congenital long QT syndrome or patients receiving medicinal products \nknown to cause QT prolongation. \n \nSince cinacalcet lowers serum calcium, patients should be monitored carefully for the occurrence of \nhypocalcaemia (see section 4.2). Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or \ndose adjustment of cinacalcet. \n \nAdults \nCinacalcet treatment should not be initiated in patients with a serum calcium (corrected for albumin) \nbelow the lower limit of the normal range. \n \nIn CKD patients receiving dialysis who were administered cinacalcet, approximately 30% of patients \nhad at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nCinacalcet should only be initiated for the treatment of secondary HPT in children \u2265 3 years old with \nESRD on maintenance dialysis therapy, in whom secondary HPT is not adequately controlled with \nstandard of care therapy, where serum calcium is in the upper range of, or above, the age-specified \nreference interval. \n \nClosely monitor serum calcium levels (see section 4.2) and patient compliance during treatment with \ncinacalcet. Do not initiate cinacalcet or increase the dose if non-compliance is suspected. \n \nPrior to initiating cinacalcet and during treatment, consider the risks and benefits of treatment and the \nability of the patient to comply with the recommendations to monitor and manage the risk of \nhypocalcaemia. \n \nInform paediatric patients and/or their caregivers about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and about the \nimportance of adherence to instructions about serum calcium monitoring, and posology and method of \nadministration. \n \nCKD patients not on dialysis \nCinacalcet is not indicated for CKD patients not on dialysis. Investigational studies have shown that \nadult CKD patients not on dialysis treated with cinacalcet have an increased risk for hypocalcaemia \n(serum calcium levels < 8.4 mg/dL [2.1 mmol/L]) compared with cinacalcet-treated CKD patients on \ndialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels and/or the presence of residual kidney \nfunction. \n \nSeizures \n \nCases of seizures have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet (see section 4.8). The threshold \nfor seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Therefore, serum calcium \nlevels should be closely monitored in patients receiving cinacalcet, particularly in patients with a \nhistory of a seizure disorder. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \nHypotension and/or worsening heart failure \n \nCases of hypotension and/or worsening heart failure have been reported in patients with impaired \ncardiac function, in which a causal relationship to cinacalcet could not be completely excluded and \nmay be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels (see section 4.8). \n \nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n \nAdminister cinacalcet with caution in patients receiving any other medicinal products known to lower \nserum calcium. Closely monitor serum calcium (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients receiving cinacalcet should not be given etelcalcetide. Concurrent administration may result \nin severe hypocalcaemia. \n \nGeneral \n \nAdynamic bone disease may develop if PTH levels are chronically suppressed below approximately \n1.5 times the upper limit of normal with the iPTH assay. If PTH levels decrease below the \nrecommended target range in patients treated with cinacalcet, the dose of cinacalcet and/or vitamin D \nsterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued. \n \nTestosterone levels \n \nTestosterone levels are often below the normal range in patients with end-stage renal disease. In a \nclinical study of adult ESRD patients on dialysis, free testosterone levels decreased by a median of \n31.3% in the cinacalcet-treated patients and by 16.3% in the placebo-treated patients after 6 months of \ntreatment. An open-label extension of this study showed no further reductions in free and total \ntestosterone concentrations over a period of 3 years in cinacalcet-treated patients. The clinical \nsignificance of these reductions in serum testosterone is unknown. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nDue to the potential for 2 to 4 fold higher plasma levels of cinacalcet in patients with moderate to \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification), cinacalcet should be used with caution in these \npatients and treatment should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMedicinal products known to reduce serum calcium \n \nConcurrent administration of other medicinal products known to reduce serum calcium and cinacalcet \nmay result in an increased risk of hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). Patients receiving cinacalcet should \nnot be given etelcalcetide (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of other medications on cinacalcet \n \nCinacalcet is metabolised in part by the enzyme CYP3A4. Co-administration of 200 mg bid \nketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, caused an approximate 2-fold increase in cinacalcet \nlevels. Dose adjustment of cinacalcet may be required if a patient receiving cinacalcet initiates or \ndiscontinues therapy with a strong inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, telithromycin, \nvoriconazole, ritonavir) or inducer (e.g. rifampicin) of this enzyme. \n \nIn vitro data indicate that cinacalcet is in part metabolised by CYP1A2. Smoking induces CYP1A2; \nthe clearance of cinacalcet was observed to be 36-38% higher in smokers than non-smokers. The \neffect of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) on cinacalcet plasma levels has not \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nbeen studied. Dose adjustment may be necessary if a patient starts or stops smoking or when \nconcomitant treatment with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is initiated or discontinued. \n \nCalcium carbonate: Co-administration of calcium carbonate (single 1,500 mg dose) did not alter the \npharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. \n \nSevelamer: Co-administration of sevelamer (2,400 mg tid) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \ncinacalcet. \n \nPantoprazole: Co-administration of pantoprazole (80 mg od) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of \ncinacalcet. \n \nEffect of cinacalcet on other medications \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by the enzyme P450 2D6 (CYP2D6): Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor \nof CYP2D6. Dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products may be required when cinacalcet is \nadministered with individually titrated, narrow therapeutic index substances that are predominantly \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 (e.g. flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol, desipramine, nortriptyline, \nclomipramine). \n \nDesipramine: Concurrent administration of 90 mg cinacalcet once daily with 50 mg desipramine, a \ntricyclic antidepressant metabolised primarily by CYP2D6, significantly increased desipramine \nexposure 3.6-fold (90% CI 3.0, 4.4) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. \n \nDextromethorphan: Multiple doses of 50 mg cinacalcet increased the AUC of 30 mg \ndextromethorphan (metabolised primarily by CYP2D6) by 11-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. \n \nWarfarin: Multiple oral doses of cinacalcet did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics \n(as measured by prothrombin time and clotting factor VII) of warfarin. \n \nThe lack of effect of cinacalcet on the pharmacokinetics of R-and S-warfarin and the absence of auto-\ninduction upon multiple dosing in patients indicates that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP3A4, \nCYP1A2 or CYP2C9 in humans. \n \nMidazolam: Co-administration of cinacalcet (90 mg) with orally administered midazolam (2 mg), a \nCYP3A4 and CYP3A5 substrate, did not alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. These data suggest \nthat cinacalcet would not affect the pharmacokinetics of those classes of medicines that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, such as certain immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine \nand tacrolimus. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no clinical data from the use of cinacalcet in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, parturition or postnatal development. No \nembryonal/foetal toxicities were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits with the exception of \ndecreased foetal body weights in rats at doses associated with maternal toxicities (see section 5.3). \nCinacalcet should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted in human milk. Cinacalcet is excreted in the milk of \nlactating rats with a high milk to plasma ratio. Following careful benefit/risk assessment, a decision \nshould be made to discontinue either breast-feeding or treatment with cinacalcet. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data relating to the effect of cinacalcet on fertility. There were no effects on \nfertility in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDizziness and seizures, which may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines, have \nbeen reported by patients taking cinacalcet (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na) Summary of the safety profile \n \nSecondary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism \n \nBased on available data from patients receiving cinacalcet in placebo-controlled studies and single-\narm studies the most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea and vomiting. Nausea and \nvomiting were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature in the majority of patients. \nDiscontinuation of therapy as a result of undesirable effects was mainly due to nausea and vomiting. \n \nb) Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions, considered at least possibly attributable to cinacalcet treatment in the placebo-\ncontrolled studies and single-arm studies based on best-evidence assessment of causality are listed \nbelow using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). \n\n \nIncidence of adverse reactions from controlled clinical studies and post-marketing experience are: \n \n\nMedDRA system organ class Subject incidence Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Common* Hypersensitivity reactions \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common Anorexia Decreased appetite \nNervous system disorders Common Seizures\u2020 Dizziness \n\nParaesthesia \nHeadache \n\nCardiac disorders Not known* Worsening heart failure\u2020 \nQT prolongation and \nventricular arrhythmia \nsecondary to hypocalcaemia\u2020 \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon Upper respiratory infection \nDyspnoea Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea Vomiting \nCommon Dyspepsia Diarrhoea \n\nAbdominal pain Abdominal \npain \u2013 upper Constipation \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common Rash \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Myalgia Muscle spasms Back \npain \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Asthenia \n\nInvestigations Common Hypocalcaemia\u2020 \nHyperkalaemia \nReduced testosterone levels\u2020 \n\n\u2020see section 4.4 \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n*see section c \n \nc) Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and urticaria have been identified during post-\nmarketing use of cinacalcet. The frequencies of the individual preferred terms including angioedema \nand urticaria cannot be estimated from available data. \n \nHypotension and/or worsening heart failure \nThere have been reports of idiosyncratic cases of hypotension and/or worsening heart failure in \ncinacalcet-treated patients with impaired cardiac function in post-marketing safety surveillance, the \nfrequencies of which cannot be estimated from available data. \n \nQT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia \nQT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia have been identified during \npost-marketing use of cinacalcet, the frequencies of which cannot be estimated from available data \n(see section 4.4). \n \nd) Paediatric population \n \nThe safety of cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary HPT in paediatric patients with ESRD \nreceiving dialysis was evaluated in two randomised controlled studies and one single-arm study \n(see section 5.1). Among all paediatric subjects exposed to cinacalcet in clinical studies a total of \n19 subjects (24.1%; 64.5 per 100 subject years) had at least one adverse event of hypocalcaemia. A \nfatal outcome was reported in a paediatric clinical trial patient with severe hypocalcaemia (see section \n4.4). \n \nCinacalcet should be used in paediatric patients only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses titrated up to 300 mg once daily have been administered to adult patients receiving dialysis \nwithout adverse outcome. A daily dose of 3.9 mg/kg was prescribed to a paediatric patient receiving \ndialysis in a clinical study with subsequent mild stomach ache, nausea and vomiting.  \n \nOverdose of cinacalcet may lead to hypocalcaemia. In the event of overdose, patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia, and treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Since cinacalcet is highly protein-bound, haemodialysis is not an effective treatment for \noverdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, anti-parathyroid agents, ATC code: H05BX01.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n \n\nThe calcium sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal \nregulator of PTH secretion. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent which directly lowers PTH levels by \nincreasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptor to extracellular calcium. The reduction in \nPTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels. \n \nReductions in PTH levels correlate with cinacalcet concentration. \n \nAfter steady state is reached, serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval.  \n \nSecondary hyperparathyroidism \n \nAdults \nThree, 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted in ESRD patients \nwith uncontrolled secondary HPT receiving dialysis (n = 1,136). Demographic and baseline \ncharacteristics were representative of the dialysis patient population with secondary HPT. Mean \nbaseline iPTH concentrations across the 3 studies were 733 and 683 pg/mL (77.8 and 72.4 pmol/L) for \nthe cinacalcet and placebo groups, respectively. 66% of patients were receiving vitamin D sterols at \nstudy entry, and > 90% were receiving phosphate binders. Significant reductions in iPTH, serum \ncalcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P), calcium, and phosphorus were observed in the cinacalcet-\ntreated patients compared with placebo-treated patients receiving standard of care, and the results were \nconsistent across the 3 studies. In each of the studies, the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with \nan iPTH \u2264 250 pg/mL (\u2264 26.5 pmol/L)) was achieved by 41%, 46%, and 35% of patients receiving \ncinacalcet, compared with 4%, 7%, and 6% of patients receiving placebo. Approximately 60% of \ncinacalcet-treated patients achieved a \u2265 30% reduction in iPTH levels, and this effect was consistent \nacross the spectrum of baseline iPTH levels. The mean reductions in serum Ca x P, calcium, and \nphosphorus were 14%, 7% and 8%, respectively. \n \nReductions in iPTH and Ca x P were maintained for up to 12 months of treatment. Cinacalcet \ndecreased iPTH and Ca x P, calcium and phosphorus levels regardless of baseline iPTH or Ca x P \nlevel, dialysis modality (PD versus HD), duration of dialysis, and whether or not vitamin D sterols \nwere administered. \n \nReductions in PTH were associated with non-significant reductions of bone metabolism markers (bone \nspecific alkaline phosphatase, N-telopeptide, bone turnover and bone fibrosis). In post-hoc analyses of \npooled data from 6 and 12 months clinical studies, Kaplan-Meier estimates of bone fracture and \nparathyroidectomy were lower in the cinacalcet group compared with the control group. \n \nInvestigational studies in patients with CKD and secondary HPT not undergoing dialysis indicated that \ncinacalcet reduced PTH levels to a similar extent as in patients with ESRD and secondary HPT \nreceiving dialysis. However, efficacy, safety, optimal doses and treatment targets have not been \nestablished in treatment of predialytic renal failure patients. These studies show that CKD patients not \nundergoing dialysis treated with cinacalcet have an increased risk for hypocalcaemia compared with \ncinacalcet-treated ESRD patients receiving dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium  \nlevels and/or the presence of residual kidney function. \n \nEVOLVE (EValuation Of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) was a randomised, \ndouble-blind clinical study evaluating cinacalcet versus placebo for the reduction of the risk of all-\ncause mortality and cardiovascular events in 3,883 patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving \ndialysis. The study did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in risk of all-cause \nmortality or cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, \nheart failure or peripheral vascular event (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.02; p = 0.112). After adjusting for \nbaseline characteristics in a secondary analysis, the HR for the primary composite endpoint was 0.88; \n95% CI: 0.79, 0.97. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary HPT in paediatric patients with \nESRD receiving dialysis was evaluated in two randomised controlled studies and one single-arm \nstudy. \n \nStudy 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 43 patients aged 6 to < 18 years were \nrandomised to receive either cinacalcet (n = 22) or placebo (n = 21). The study consisted of a 24-week \ndose titration period followed by a 6-week efficacy assessment phase (EAP), and a 30-week \nopen-label extension. The mean age at baseline was 13 (range 6 to 18) years. The majority of patients \n(91%) were using vitamin D sterols at baseline. The mean (SD) iPTH concentrations at baseline were \n757.1 (440.1) pg/mL for the cinacalcet group and 795.8 (537.9) pg/mL for the placebo group. The \nmean  (SD) corrected total serum calcium concentrations at baseline were 9.9 (0.5) mg/dL for the \ncinacalcet group and 9.9 (0.6) mg/dL for the placebo group. The mean maximum daily dose of \ncinacalcet was 1.0 mg/kg/day. \n \nThe percentage of patients who achieved the primary endpoint (\u2265 30% reduction from baseline in \nmean plasma iPTH during the EAP; weeks 25 to 30) was 55% in the cinacalcet group and 19.0% in \nthe placebo group (p = 0.02). The mean serum calcium levels during the EAP were within the normal \nrange for the cinacalcet treatment group. This study was terminated early due to a fatality with severe \nhypocalcaemia in the cinacalcet group (see section 4.8). \n \nStudy 2 was an open-label study in which 55 patients aged 6 to < 18 years (mean 13 years) were \nrandomised to receive either cinacalcet in addition to standard of care (SOC, n = 27) or SOC alone \n(n = 28). The majority of patients (75%) were using vitamin D sterols at baseline. The mean (SD) \niPTH concentrations at baseline were 946 (635) pg/mL for the cinacalcet + SOC group and \n1228 (732) pg/mL for the SOC group. The mean (SD) corrected total serum calcium concentrations at \nbaseline were 9.8 (0.6) mg/dL for the cinacalcet + SOC group and 9.8 (0.6) mg/dL for the SOC group. \n25 subjects received at least one dose of cinacalcet and the mean maximum daily dose of cinacalcet \nwas 0.55 mg/kg/day. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (\u2265 30% reduction from baseline in \nmean plasma iPTH during the EAP; weeks 17 to 20). Reduction of \u2265 30% from baseline in mean \nplasma iPTH during the EAP was achieved by 22% of patients in the cinacalcet + SOC group and 32% \nof patients in the SOC group. \n \nStudy 3 was a 26-week, open-label, single-arm safety study in patients aged 8 months to < 6 years \n(mean age 3 years). Patients receiving concomitant medications known to prolong the corrected QT \ninterval were excluded from the study. The mean dry weight at baseline was 12 kg. The starting dose \nof cinacalcet was 0.20 mg/kg. The majority of patients (89%) were using vitamin D sterols at baseline. \n \nSeventeen patients received at least one dose of cinacalcet and 11 completed at least 12 weeks of \ntreatment. None had corrected serum calcium < 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) for ages 2-5 years. iPTH \nconcentrations from baseline were reduced by \u2265 30% in 71% (12 out of 17) of patients in the study. \n \nParathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism \n \nIn one study, 46 adult patients (29 with parathyroid carcinoma and 17 with primary HPT and severe \nhypercalcaemia who had failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy) received cinacalcet for \nup to 3 years (mean of 328 days for patients with parathyroid carcinoma and mean of 347 days for \npatients with primary HPT). Cinacalcet was administered at doses ranging from 30 mg twice daily to \n90 mg four times daily. The primary endpoint of the study was a reduction of serum calcium of \n\u2265 1 mg/dL (\u2265 0.25 mmol/L). In patients with parathyroid carcinoma, mean serum calcium declined \nfrom 14.1 mg/dL to 12.4 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L to 3.1 mmol/L), while in patients with primary HPT, \nserum calcium levels declined from 12.7 mg/dL to 10.4 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/L to 2.6 mmol/L). \nEighteen (18) of 29 patients (62%) with parathyroid carcinoma and 15 of 17 subjects (88%) with \nprimary HPT achieved a reduction in serum calcium of \u2265 1 mg/dL (\u2265 0.25 mmol/L). \n \nIn a 28 week placebo-controlled study, 67 adult patients with primary HPT who met criteria for \nparathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L) but \n\u2264 12.5 mg/dL (3.12 mmol/L), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy were included. \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nCinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum \ncalcium concentration within the normal range. A significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated \npatients achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration \u2264 10.3 mg/dL (2.57 mmol/L) and \n\u2265 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium \nconcentration, when compared with the placebo-treated patients (75.8% versus 0% and 84.8% versus \n5.9% respectively). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration of cinacalcet, maximum plasma cinacalcet concentration is achieved in \napproximately 2 to 6 hours. Based on between-study comparisons, the absolute bioavailability of \ncinacalcet in fasted subjects has been estimated to be about 20-25%. Administration of cinacalcet with \nfood results in an approximate 50\u201380% increase in cinacalcet bioavailability. Increases in plasma \ncinacalcet concentration are similar, regardless of the fat content of the meal. \n \nAt doses above 200 mg, the absorption was saturated probably due to poor solubility.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution is high (approximately 1,000 litres), indicating extensive distribution. \nCinacalcet is approximately 97% bound to plasma proteins and distributes minimally into red blood \ncells. \n \nAfter absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of \napproximately 6 hours and a terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady state levels of cinacalcet are \nachieved within 7 days with minimal accumulation. The pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet does not \nchange over time. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nCinacalcet is metabolised by multiple enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (the \ncontribution of CYP1A2 has not been characterised clinically). The major circulating metabolites are \ninactive. \n \nBased on in vitro data, cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, but is neither an inhibitor of other \nCYP enzymes at concentrations achieved clinically, including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, and CYP3A4 nor an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter administration of a 75 mg radiolabelled dose to healthy volunteers, cinacalcet was rapidly and \nextensively metabolised by oxidation followed by conjugation. Renal excretion of metabolites was the \nprevalent route of elimination of radioactivity. Approximately 80% of the dose was recovered in the \nurine and 15% in the faeces. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe AUC and Cmax of cinacalcet increase approximately linearly over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg \nonce daily. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nSoon after dosing, PTH begins to decrease until a nadir at approximately 2 to 6 hours post-dose, \ncorresponding with cinacalcet Cmax. Thereafter, as cinacalcet levels begin to decline, PTH levels \nincrease until 12 hours post-dose, and then PTH suppression remains approximately constant to the \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nend of the once daily dosing interval. PTH levels in cinacalcet clinical trials were measured at the end \nof the dosing interval. \n \nElderly \nThere are no clinically relevant differences due to age in the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal \ninsufficiency, and those on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is comparable to that in healthy \nvolunteers. \n \nHepatic insufficiency  \nMild hepatic impairment did not notably affect the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. Compared to \nsubjects with normal liver function, average AUC of cinacalcet was approximately 2-fold higher in \nsubjects with moderate impairment and approximately 4-fold higher in subjects with severe \nimpairment. The mean half-life of cinacalcet is prolonged by 33% and 70% in patients with moderate \nand severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Protein binding of cinacalcet is not affected by impaired \nhepatic function. Because doses are titrated for each subject based on safety and efficacy parameters, \nno additional dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \nGender \nClearance of cinacalcet may be lower in women than in men. Because doses are titrated for each \nsubject, no additional dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet was studied in paediatric patients with ESRD receiving dialysis \naged 3 to 17 years of age. After single and multiple once daily oral doses of cinacalcet, plasma \ncinacalcet concentrations (Cmax and AUC values after normalisation by dose and weight) were similar \nto those observed in adult patients. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic \ncharacteristics. This analysis showed no significant impact of age, sex, race, body surface area, and \nbody weight on cinacalcet pharmacokinetics. \n \nSmoking \nClearance of cinacalcet is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, likely due to induction of CYP1A2-\nmediated metabolism. If a patient stops or starts smoking, cinacalcet plasma levels may change and \ndose adjustment may be necessary. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCinacalcet was not teratogenic in rabbits when given at a dose of 0.4 times, on an AUC basis, the \nmaximum human dose for secondary HPT (180 mg daily). The non-teratogenic dose in rats was 4.4 \ntimes, on an AUC basis, the maximum dose for secondary HPT. There were no effects on fertility in \nmales or females at exposures up to 4 times a human dose of 180 mg/day (safety margins in the small \npopulation of patients administered a maximum clinical dose of 360 mg daily would be approximately \nhalf those given above). \n \nIn pregnant rats, there were slight decreases in body weight and food consumption at the highest dose. \nDecreased foetal weights were seen in rats at doses where dams had severe hypocalcaemia. Cinacalcet \nhas been shown to cross the placental barrier in rabbits. \n \nCinacalcet did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. Safety margins from the toxicology \nstudies are small due to the dose-limiting hypocalcaemia observed in the animal models. Cataracts and \nlens opacities were observed in the repeat dose rodent toxicology and carcinogenicity studies, but were \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nnot observed in dogs or monkeys or in clinical studies where cataract formation was monitored. \nCataracts are known to occur in rodents as a result of hypocalcaemia. \n \nIn in vitro studies, IC50 values for the serotonin transporter and KATP channels were found to be 7 and \n12-fold greater, respectively, than the EC50 for the calcium-sensing receptor obtained under the same \nexperimental conditions. The clinical relevance is unknown, however, the potential for cinacalcet to \nact on these secondary targets cannot be fully excluded. \n \nIn toxicity studies in juvenile dogs, tremors secondary to decreased serum calcium, emesis, decreased \nbody weight and body weight gain, decreased red cell mass, slight decreases in bone densitometry \nparameters, reversible widening of the growth plates of long bones, and histological lymphoid changes \n(restricted to the thoracic cavity and attributed to chronic emesis) were observed. All of these effects \nwere seen at a systemic exposure, on an AUC basis, approximately equivalent to the exposure in \npatients at the maximum dose for secondary HPT. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cinacalcet Accordpharma is and what it is used for \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma contains the active ingredient cinacalcet, which works by controlling the \nlevels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorous in your body. It is used to treat \nproblems with organs called parathyroid glands. The parathyroids are four small glands in the neck, \nnear the thyroid gland, that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma is used in adults: \n- to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with serious kidney disease who need dialysis \n\nto clear their blood of waste products. \n- to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with parathyroid \n\ncancer. \n- to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with primary \n\nhyperparathyroidism when removal of the gland is not possible. \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma is used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years of age to treat \nsecondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who need dialysis to clear their \nblood of waste products, whose condition is not controlled with other treatments. \n \nIn primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism too much PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands. \n\u201cPrimary\u201d means that the hyperparathyroidism is not caused by any other condition and \u201csecondary\u201d \nmeans that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, e.g. kidney disease. Both primary \nand secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium in the bones, which can lead to bone \npain and fractures, problems with blood and heart vessels, kidney stones, mental illness and coma. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Cinacalcet Accordpharma \n \nDo not take Cinacalcet Accordpharma:  \n- if you are allergic to cinacalcet or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n- if you have low levels of calcium in your blood. Your doctor will monitor your blood calcium \n\nlevels. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cinacalcet Accordpharma. \n \nBefore you start taking Cinacalcet Accordpharma, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had: \n- seizures (fits or convulsions). The risk of having seizures is higher if you have had them before; \n- liver problems; \n- heart failure. \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma reduces calcium levels. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes \nassociated with low calcium levels (hypocalcaemia) have been reported in adults and children treated \nwith Cinacalcet Accordpharma. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you experience any of the following which may be signs of low calcium \nlevels: spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or \naround your mouth or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with Cinacalcet \nAccordpharma. \n \nLow calcium levels can have an effect on your heart rhythm. Tell your doctor if you experience an \nunusually fast or pounding heartbeat, if you have heart rhythm problems, or if you take medicines \nknown to cause heart rhythm problems, while taking Cinacalcet Accordpharma. \n \nFor additional information see section 4. \n \nDuring treatment with Cinacalcet Accordpharma, tell your doctor: \n- if you start or stop smoking, as this may affect the way Cinacalcet Accordpharma works. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nChildren under the age of 18 with parathyroid cancer or primary hyperparathyroidism must not take \nCinacalcet Accordpharma. \n \nIf you are being treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism, your doctor should monitor your calcium \nlevels before starting treatment with Cinacalcet Accordpharma and during treatment with Cinacalcet \nAccordpharma. You should inform your doctor if you experience any of the signs of low calcium \nlevels as described above. \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma is only available as film-coated tablet. Thus, it is not possible to administer \nCinacalcet Accordpharma to paediatric patients that require less than a full 30 mg dose. If an alternate \ndose is required, other cinacalcet medicines offering such an option should be used. \n \nIt is important that you take your dose of Cinacalcet Accordpharma as advised by your doctor. \n \nOther medicines and Cinacalcet Accordpharma \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \nparticularly etelcalcetide or any other medicines that lower the level of calcium in your blood. \n \nYou should not receive Cinacalcet Accordpharma together with etelcalcetide. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines \n \nMedicines such as these can affect how Cinacalcet Accordpharma works: \n- medicines used to treat skin and fungal infections (ketoconazole, itraconazole and \n\nvoriconazole); \n- medicines used to treat bacterial infections (telithromycin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin); \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n- a medicine used to treat HIV infection and AIDS (ritonavir); \n- a medicine used to treat depression (fluvoxamine). \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma may affect how medicines such as the following work: \n- medicines used to treat depression (amitriptyline, desipramine, nortriptyline and \n\nclomipramine); \n- a medicine used to relieve cough (dextromethorphan); \n- medicines used to treat changes in heart rate (flecainide and propafenone); \n- a medicine used to treat high blood pressure (metoprolol). \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nCinacalcet Accordpharma has not been tested in pregnant women.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what cinacalcet accordpharma is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "cinacalcet accordpharma contains the active ingredient cinacalcet, which works by controlling the levels of parathyroid hormone (pth), calcium and phosphorous in your body. it is used to treat problems with organs called parathyroid glands. the parathyroids are four small glands in the neck, near the thyroid gland, that produce parathyroid hormone (pth). cinacalcet accordpharma is used in adults: - to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with serious kidney disease who need dialysis to clear their blood of waste products. - to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with parathyroid cancer. - to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with primary hyperparathyroidism when removal of the gland is not possible. cinacalcet accordpharma is used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years of age to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who need dialysis to clear their blood of waste products, whose condition is not controlled with other treatments. in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism too much pth is produced by the parathyroid glands. \"primary\" means that the hyperparathyroidism is not caused by any other condition and \"secondary\" means that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, e.g. kidney disease. both primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium in the bones, which can lead to bone pain and fractures, problems with blood and heart vessels, kidney stones, mental illness and coma.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "cinacalcet accordpharma", "Type":
