NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nXtandi - 40 mg soft capsules \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nXtandi - 40 mg soft capsules \nEach soft capsule contains 40 mg of enzalutamide. \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect  \nEach soft capsule contains 57.8 mg of sorbitol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\nSoft capsule. \nWhite to off-white oblong soft capsules (approximately 20 mm x 9 mm) imprinted with \u201cENZ\u201d in \nblack ink on one side. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\nXtandi is indicated for: \n\u2022 the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \n\n(CRPC) (see section 5.1). \n\u2022 the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly \n\nsymptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet \nclinically indicated (see section 5.1). \n\n\u2022 the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after \ndocetaxel therapy. \n \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTreatment with enzalutamide should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced \nin the medical treatment of prostate cancer. \n\nPosology  \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg soft capsules) as a single oral daily dose. \n \nMedical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be \ncontinued during treatment of patients not surgically castrated. \n \nIf a patient misses taking Xtandi at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as \npossible to the usual time. If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the \nfollowing day with the usual daily dose. \n \nIf a patient experiences a \u2265 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction, dosing should be \nwithheld for one week or until symptoms improve to \u2264 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced \ndose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nConcomitant use with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If patients must be \nco-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg \nonce daily. If co-administration of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose \nshould be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (see section 4.5). \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh Class A, B or C, respectively). An increased half-life of enzalutamide has however been \nobserved in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nCaution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population  \nThere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of \nadult men with CRPC. \n\nMethod of administration  \nXtandi is for oral use. The soft capsules should not be chewed, dissolved or opened but should be \nswallowed whole with water, and can be taken with or without food. \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \nWomen who are or may become pregnant (see sections 4.6 and 6.6). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\nRisk of seizure \nUse of enzalutamide has been associated with seizure (see section 4.8). The decision to continue \ntreatment in patients who develop seizure should be taken case by case. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \nThere have been rare reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients \nreceiving Xtandi (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present \nwith rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, blindness, and other visual \nand neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires \nconfirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discontinuation of \nXtandi in patients who develop PRES is recommended. \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \nEnzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used \nmedicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). A review of concomitant medicinal products should \ntherefore be conducted when initiating enzalutamide treatment. Concomitant use of enzalutamide with \nmedicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see \nsection 4.5) should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, \nand if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nCo-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. If Xtandi is \nco-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), \nadditional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring should be conducted (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment \nCaution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as enzalutamide has not been studied in \nthis patient population. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nAn increased half-life of enzalutamide has been observed in patients with severe hepatic impairment, \npossibly related to increased tissue distribution. The clinical relevance of this observation remains \nunknown. A prolonged time to reach steady state concentrations is however anticipated, and the time \nto maximum pharmacological effect as well as time for onset and decline of enzyme induction (see \nsection 4.5) may be increased. \n \nRecent cardiovascular disease \nThe phase 3 studies excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or \nunstable angina (in the past 3 months), New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III or IV heart \nfailure except if Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \u2265 45%, bradycardia or uncontrolled \nhypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi is prescribed in these patients. \n \nAndrogen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval \nIn patients with a history of or risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products that might prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5) physicians should assess the \nbenefit risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to initiating Xtandi. \n \nUse with chemotherapy \nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been \nestablished. Co-administration of enzalutamide has no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of intravenous docetaxel (see section 4.5); however, an increase in the occurrence of \ndocetaxel-induced neutropenia cannot be excluded. \n \nExcipients \nXtandi contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should \nnot take this medicinal product. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, rash, or face, tongue, \nlip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide (see section 4.8). \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures \n \nCYP2C8 inhibitors  \nCYP2C8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active \nmetabolite. Following oral administration of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice \ndaily) to healthy male subjects, the AUC of enzalutamide increased by 326% while Cmax of \nenzalutamide decreased by 18%. For the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active \nmetabolite, the AUC increased by 77% while Cmax decreased by 19%. Strong inhibitors (e.g. \ngemfibrozil) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enzalutamide treatment. If \npatients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be \nreduced to 80 mg once daily (see section 4.2). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors  \nCYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. Following oral administration of the \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the AUC of \nenzalutamide increased by 41% while Cmax was unchanged. For the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus \nthe unbound active metabolite, the AUC increased by 27% while Cmax was again unchanged. No dose \nadjustment is necessary when Xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors of CYP3A4. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing oral administration of the moderate CYP2C8 and strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin (600 mg \nonce daily) to healthy male subjects, the AUC of enzalutamide plus the active metabolite decreased by \n37% while Cmax remained unchanged. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi is co-\nadministered with inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. \n \nPotential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products \n \nEnzyme induction \nEnzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and \ntransporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of \nenzymes or transporters is expected. The reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and \nlead to lost or reduced clinical effect. There is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites. \nEnzymes that may be induced include CYP3A in the liver and gut, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and \nuridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The \ntransport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug \nresistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and the organic anion \ntransporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). \n \nIn vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer \nof CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral \ndoses of sensitive CYP substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the AUC \nof midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), \nand a 70% decrease in the AUC of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate). UGT1A1 may have been \ninduced as well. In a clinical study in patients with metastatic CRPC, Xtandi (160 mg once daily) had \nno clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered docetaxel \n(75 mg/m2 by infusion every 3 weeks). The AUC of docetaxel decreased by 12% [geometric mean \nratio (GMR) = 0.882 (90% CI: 0.767, 1.02)] while Cmax decreased by 4% [GMR = 0.963 (90% CI: \n0.834, 1.11)].  \n \nInteractions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport \nare expected. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are \nnot easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal \nproducts are to be avoided or used with caution. The risk for liver injury after paracetamol \nadministration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers. \n \nGroups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to: \n \n\u2022 Analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, tramadol) \n\u2022 Antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) \n\u2022 Anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) \n\u2022 Antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) \n\u2022 Antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) \n\u2022 Antithrombotics (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin, clopidogrel) \n\u2022 Betablockers (e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol) \n\u2022 Calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) \n\u2022 Cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) \n\u2022 Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) \n\u2022 HIV antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) \n\u2022 Hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) \n\u2022 Immunosuppressant (e.g. tacrolimus) \n\u2022 Proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) \n\u2022 Statins metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin) \n\u2022 Thyroid agents (e.g. levothyroxine) \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThe full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start \nof treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some \ninduction effects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of \nCYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible loss of \npharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during \nthe first month of enzalutamide treatment and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. In \nconsideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days, see section 5.2), effects on enzymes may \npersist for one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the \nconcomitant medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. \n \nCYP1A2 and CYP2C8 substrates \nEnzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the AUC or Cmax of \ncaffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) or pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate). The AUC of pioglitazone increased \nby 20% while Cmax decreased by 18%. The AUC and Cmax of caffeine decreased by 11% and 4% \nrespectively. No dose adjustment is indicated when a CYP1A2 or CYP2C8 substrate is \nco-administered with Xtandi. \n \nP-gp substrates  \nIn vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp. The effect of \nenzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical \nuse, enzalutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). \nMedicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, \ndabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with \nXtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations. \n \nBCRP, MRP2, OAT3 and OCT1 substrates  \nBased on in vitro data, inhibition of BCRP and MRP2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion \ntransporter 3 (OAT3) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. \nTheoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown.  \n \nMedicinal products which prolong the QT interval  \nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, the concomitant use of Xtandi with \nmedicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal products able to induce Torsade de \npointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, \nibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be \ncarefully evaluated (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of food on enzalutamide exposures \nFood has no clinically significant effect on the extent of exposure to enzalutamide. In clinical trials, \nXtandi was administered without regard to food. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \nThere are no human data on the use of Xtandi in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use in \nwomen of childbearing potential. This medicine may cause harm to the unborn child or potential loss \nof pregnancy if taken by women who are pregnant (see sections 4.3, 5.3, and 6.6). \n \nContraception in males and females \nIt is not known whether enzalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required \nduring and for 3 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexual activity \nwith a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing \npotential, a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after \ntreatment. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPregnancy \nEnzalutamide is not for use in women. Enzalutamide is contraindicated in women who are or may \nbecome pregnant (see sections 4.3, 5.3, and 6.6). \n\nBreast-feeding  \nEnzalutamide is not for use in women. It is not known if enzalutamide is present in human milk. \nEnzalutamide and/or its metabolites are secreted in rat milk (see section 5.3). \n\nFertility  \nAnimal studies showed that enzalutamide affected the reproductive system in male rats and dogs (see \nsection 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\nXtandi has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines as psychiatric and neurologic \nevents including seizure have been reported (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised of the \npotential risk of experiencing a psychiatric or neurological event while driving or operating machines. \nNo studies to evaluate the effects of enzalutamide on the ability to drive and use machines have been \nconducted. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \nThe most common adverse reactions are asthenia/fatigue, hot flush, fractures, and hypertension. Other \nimportant adverse reactions include fall, cognitive disorder, and neutropenia. \n \nSeizure occurred in 0.4% of enzalutamide-treated patients, 0.1% of placebo-treated patients and 0.3% \nin bicalutamide-treated patients. \n \nRare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome have been reported in enzalutamide-\ntreated patients (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency \ncategories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions identified in controlled clinical trials and post-marketing \n\nMedDRA System organ class  Adverse reaction and frequency \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon: leucopenia, neutropenia \nNot known*: thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders Not known*: face oedema, tongue oedema, lip oedema, \npharyngeal oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common: anxiety \nUncommon: visual hallucination \n\nNervous system disorders Common: headache, memory impairment, amnesia,  \ndisturbance in attention, restless legs syndrome \nUncommon: cognitive disorder, seizure\u00a5 \nNot known*: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n\nCardiac disorders Common: ischemic heart disease\u2020 \nNot known*: QT-prolongation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nVascular disorders Very common: hot flush, hypertension \nGastrointestinal disorders Not known*: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon: dry skin, pruritus \nNot known*: rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common: fractures\u2021 \nNot known*: myalgia, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, back \npain \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorder \n\nCommon: gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common: asthenia, fatigue \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nCommon: fall \n\n*  Spontaneous reports from post-marketing experience \n\n\u00a5  As evaluated by narrow SMQs of \u2018Convulsions\u2019 including convulsion, grand mal convulsion, complex partial seizures, \npartial seizures, and status epilepticus. This includes rare cases of seizure with complications leading to death. \n\n\u2020  As evaluated by narrow SMQs of \u2018Myocardial Infarction\u2019 and \u2018Other Ischemic Heart Disease\u2019 including the following \npreferred terms observed in at least two patients in randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 studies: angina pectoris, \ncoronary artery disease, myocardial infarctions, acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, angina unstable, \nmyocardial ischaemia, and arteriosclerosis coronary artery. \n\n\u2021  Includes all preferred terms with the word \u2018fracture\u2019 in bones. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nSeizure \nIn controlled clinical studies, 13 patients (0.4%) experienced a seizure out of 3179 patients treated with \na daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas one patient (0.1%) receiving placebo and one patient \n(0.3%) receiving bicalutamide, experienced a seizure. Dose appears to be an important predictor of the \nrisk of seizure, as reflected by preclinical data, and data from a dose-escalation study. In the controlled \nclinical studies, patients with prior seizure or risk factors for seizure were excluded. \n \nIn the 9785-CL-0403 (UPWARD) single-arm trial to assess incidence of seizure in patients with \npredisposing factors for seizure (whereof 1.6% had a history of seizures), 8 of 366 (2.2%) patients \ntreated with enzalutamide experienced a seizure. The median duration of treatment was 9.3 months. \n \nThe mechanism by which enzalutamide may lower the seizure threshold is not known, but could be \nrelated to data from in vitro studies showing that enzalutamide and its active metabolite bind to and \ncan inhibit the activity of the GABA-gated chloride channel. \n \nIschemic Heart Disease \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn randomized placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred in 2.5% of patients \ntreated with enzalutamide plus ADT compared to 1.3 % patients treated with placebo plus ADT.  \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\nThere is no antidote for enzalutamide. In the event of an overdose, treatment with enzalutamide should \nbe stopped and general supportive measures initiated taking into consideration the half-life of 5.8 days. \nPatients may be at increased risk of seizures following an overdose. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: hormone antagonists and related agents, anti-androgens, ATC code: \nL02BB04. \n\nMechanism of action \nProstate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor \nsignalling. Despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, androgen receptor signalling \ncontinues to promote disease progression. Stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor \nrequires nuclear localization and DNA binding. Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling \ninhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. Enzalutamide \ncompetitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, and consequently; inhibits nuclear \ntranslocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with \nDNA even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to \nanti-androgens. Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce \ncancer cell death and tumour regression. In preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor \nagonist activity. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \nIn a phase 3 clinical trial (AFFIRM) of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with docetaxel, 54% of \npatients treated with enzalutamide, versus 1.5% of patients who received placebo, had at least a 50% \ndecline from baseline in PSA levels. \n \nIn another phase 3 clinical trial (PREVAIL) in chemo-na\u00efve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide \ndemonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined as a \u2265 50% reduction from \nbaseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% (difference = 74.5%, \np < 0.0001). \n \nIn a phase 2 clinical trial (TERRAIN) in chemo-na\u00efve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide \ndemonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined as a \u2265 50% reduction from \nbaseline), compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 82.1% versus 20.9% (difference = 61.2%, \np < 0.0001) \n \nIn a single arm trial (9785-CL-0410) of patients previously treated with at least 24 weeks of \nabiraterone (plus prednisone), 22.4% had a \u2265 50% decrease from baseline in PSA levels. According to \nprior chemotherapy history, the results proportion of patients with a \u2265 50% decrease in PSA levels \nwere 22.1% and 23.2%, for the no prior chemotherapy and prior chemotherapy patient groups, \nrespectively. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nIn the MDV3100-09 clinical trial (STRIVE) of non-metastatic and metastatic CRPC, patients receiving \nenzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total confirmed PSA response rate (defined as a \n\u2265 50% reduction from baseline) compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 81.3% versus 31.3% \n(difference = 50.0%, p < 0.0001). \n \nIn the MDV3100-14 clinical trial (PROSPER) of non-metastatic CRPC, patients receiving \nenzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher confirmed PSA response rate (defined as a \u2265 50% \nreduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 76.3% versus 2.4% \n(difference = 73.9%, p < 0.0001). \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \nEfficacy of enzalutamide was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre phase 3 \nclinical studies [MDV3100-14 (PROSPER), CRPC2 (AFFIRM), MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL)] of \npatients with progressive prostate cancer who had failed androgen deprivation therapy [LHRH \nanalogue or after bilateral orchiectomy]. The PREVAIL study enrolled metastatic CRPC \nchemotherapy-na\u00efve patients; whereas the AFFIRM study enrolled metastatic CRPC patients who had \nreceived prior docetaxel; and the PROSPER study enrolled patients with non-metastatic CRPC. All \npatients continued on a LHRH analogue or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. In the active treatment \narm, Xtandi was administered orally at a dose of 160 mg daily. In the three clinical trials, patients \nreceived placebo in the control arm and patients were allowed, but not required, to take prednisone \n(maximum daily dose allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent). \n \nChanges in PSA serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. Therefore, \nin the three studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until \ndiscontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study. \n \nMDV3100-14 (PROSPER) study (patients with non-metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe PROSPER study enrolled 1401 patients with asymptomatic, high-risk non-metastatic CRPC who \ncontinued on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; defined as LHRH analogue or prior bilateral \norchiectomy).  Patients were required to have a PSA doubling time \u2264 10 months, PSA \u2265 2 ng/mL, and \nconfirmation of non-metastatic disease by blinded independent central review (BICR). \n \nPatients with a history of mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA Class I or II), and patients taking \nmedicinal products associated with lowering the seizure threshold were allowed. Patients were \nexcluded with a previous history of seizure, a condition that might predispose them to seizure, or \ncertain prior treatments for prostate cancer (i.e., chemotherapy, ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, \naminoglutethimide and/or enzalutamide). \n \nPatients were randomised 2:1 to receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 933) \nor placebo (N = 468). Patients were stratified by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Doubling Time \n(PSADT) (< 6 months or \u2265 6 months) and the use of bone-targeting agents (yes or no). \n \nThe demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. \nThe median age at randomisation was 74 years in the enzalutamide arm and 73 years in the placebo \narm. Most patients (approximately 71%) in the study were Caucasian; 16% were Asian and 2% were \nBlack. Eighty-one percent (81%) of patients had an ECOG performance status score of 0 and 19% \npatients had an ECOG performance status of 1. \n \nMetastasis-free survival (MFS) was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to \nradiographic progression or death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of \nradiographic progression, whichever occurred first. Key secondary endpoints assessed in the study \nwere time to PSA progression, time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy (TTA), overall survival \n(OS). Additional secondary endpoints included time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and \nchemotherapy-free survival. See results below (Table 2).  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nEnzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant 71% reduction in the relative risk of radiographic \nprogression or death compared to placebo [HR = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.35), p < 0.0001]. Median MFS \nwas 36.6 months (95% CI: 33.1, NR) on the enzalutamide arm versus 14.7 months (95% CI: 14.2, \n15.0) on the placebo arm. Consistent MFS results were also observed in all pre-specified patient sub-\ngroups including PSADT (< 6 months or \u2265 6 months), demographic region (North America, Europe, \nrest of world), age (< 75 or \u2265 75), use of a prior bone-targeting agent (yes or no). \n \nTable 2: Summary of efficacy results in the PROSPER study (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n Enzalutamide \nN = 933 \n\nPlacebo \nN = 468 \n\nPrimary Endpoint \nMetastasis-free survival \n\nNumber of Events (%) 219 (23.5) 228 (48.7) \nMedian, months (95% CI)1 36.6 (33.1, NR) 14.7 (14.2, 15.0) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI)2  0.29 (0.24, 0.35) \nP-value3  p < 0.0001 \n\nKey Secondary Efficacy Endpoints \nTime to PSA progression \nNumber of Events (%)  208 (22.3) 324 (69.2) \nMedian, months (95% CI)1 37.2 (33.1, NR) 3.9 (3.8, 4.0) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI)2 0.07 (0.05, 0.08) \nP-value3 p < 0.0001 \n\nTime to first use of new antineoplastic therapy \nNumber of Events (%)  142 (15.2) 226 (48.3) \nMedian, months (95% CI)1 39.6 (37.7, NR) 17.7 (16.2, 19.7) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI)2 0.21 (0.17, 0.26) \nP-value3 p < 0.0001 \nNR = Not reached. \n1.

The median was not reached in either \ntreatment group and neither analysis showed a statistically significant difference between treatment \narms. \n \n  \nEnzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant 93% reduction in the relative risk of PSA \nprogression compared to placebo [HR = 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.08), p < 0.0001]. Median time to PSA \nprogression was 37.2 months (95% CI: 33.1, NR) on the enzalutamide arm versus 3.9 months (95% \nCI: 3.8, 4.0) on the placebo arm. \n \nEnzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the time to first use of new \nantineoplastic therapy compared to placebo [HR = 0.21 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.26), p < 0.0001].

PFS was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to \nthe earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression, PSA progression, or death on study. \nMedian PFS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 16.5, not reached) in the enzalutamide group versus \n5.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, 8.1) in the bicalutamide group [HR = 0.24 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.32), p < 0.0001]. \nConsistent benefit of enzalutamide over bicalutamide on PFS was observed in all pre-specified patient \nsubgroups. For the non-metastatic subgroup (N = 139) a total of 19 out of 70 (27.1%) patients treated \nwith enzalutamide and 49 out of 69 (71.0%) patients treated with bicalutamide had PFS events \n(68 total events). The hazard ratio was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.42) and the median time to a PFS event \nwas not reached in the enzalutamide group versus 8.6 months in the bicalutamide group. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves of progression-free survival in the STRIVE study (intent-to-\ntreat analysis) \n\n \n9785-CL-0222 (TERRAIN) study (chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe TERRAIN study enrolled 375 chemo- and antiandrogen-therapy na\u00efve patients with metastatic \nCRPC who were randomised to receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 184) \nor bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg once daily (N = 191). Median PFS was 15.7 months for patients on \nenzalutamide versus 5.8 months for patients on bicalutamide [HR = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.57), p < \n0.0001]. Progression-free survival was defined as objective evidence of radiographic disease \nprogression by independent central review, skeletal-related events, initiation of new antineoplastic \ntherapy or death by any cause, whichever occurred first. Consistent PFS benefit was observed across \nall pre-specified patient subgroups. \n \nMDV3100-03 (PREVAIL) study (chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with metastatic CRPC) \n \nA total of 1717 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients were randomised \n1:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 872) or placebo orally \nonce daily (N = 845). Patients with visceral disease, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart \nfailure (NYHA Class I or II), and patients taking medicinal products associated with lowering the \nseizure threshold were allowed. Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might \npredispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. \nStudy treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-\nrelated event, or clinical progression) and the initiation of either a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an \ninvestigational agent, or until unacceptable toxicity. \n \nPatient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. \nThe median age was 71 years (range 42 - 93) and the racial distribution was 77% Caucasian, \n10% Asian, 2% Black and 11% other or unknown races. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of patients had an \nECOG performance status score of 0 and 32% patients had an ECOG performance status of 1. \nBaseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients and 2 - 3 (mildly symptomatic) \nin 32% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (worst pain over past 24 hours \non a scale of 0 to 10). Approximately 45% of patients had measurable soft tissue disease at study \nentry, and 12% of patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases. \n \nCo-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival \n(rPFS). In addition to the co-primary endpoints, benefit was also assessed using time to initiation of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy, best overall soft tissue response, time to first skeletal-related event, PSA \nresponse (\u2265 50% decrease from baseline), time to PSA progression, and time to FACT-P total score \ndegradation. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nRadiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies as defined by \nProstate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria (for bone lesions) and/or Response \nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). Analysis of rPFS \nutilised centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression. \n \nAt the pre-specified interim analysis for overall survival when 540 deaths were observed, treatment \nwith enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to \ntreatment with placebo with a 29.4% reduction in risk of death [HR = 0.706 (95% CI: 0.60; 0.84), \np < 0.0001].  An updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed. Results \nfrom this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis (Table 3, Figure 4). At the \nupdated analysis 52% of enzalutamide-treated and 81% of placebo-treated patients had received \nsubsequent therapies for metastatic CRPC that may prolong overall survival. \n \nTable 3: Overall survival of patients treated with either enzalutamide or placebo in the \nPREVAIL study (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n \nEnzalutamide \n\n(N = 872) \nPlacebo  \n\n(N = 845) \nPre-specified interim analysis   \n\nNumber of deaths (%) 241 (27.6%) 299 (35.4%) \nMedian survival, months (95% CI) 32.4 (30.1, NR) 30.2 (28.0, NR) \n\n   P-value1 p < 0.0001 \n   Hazard ratio (95% CI)2 0.71 (0.60, 0.84) \nUpdated survival analysis   \n\nNumber of deaths (%) 368 (42.2%) 416 (49.2%) \nMedian survival, months (95% CI) 35.3 (32.2, NR) 31.3 (28.8, 34.2) \nP-value1 p = 0.0002 \n\n   Hazard ratio (95% CI)2 0.77 (0.67, 0.88) \nNR = Not reached. \n1.

One hundred and eighteen (14%) enzalutamide-treated patients and \n321 (40%) of placebo-treated patients had an event. The median rPFS was not reached (95% CI: 13.8, \nnot reached) in the enzalutamide-treated group and was 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.4) in the placebo-\ntreated group (Figure 6). Consistent rPFS benefit was observed across all pre-specified patient \nsubgroups (e.g. age, baseline ECOG performance, baseline PSA and LDH, Gleason score at diagnosis, \nand visceral disease at screening). A pre-specified follow-up rPFS analysis based on the investigator \nassessment of radiographic progression demonstrated a statistically significant improvement between \nthe treatment groups with a 69.3% reduction in risk of radiographic progression or death [HR = 0.31 \n(95% CI: 0.27, 0.35), p < 0.0001]. The median rPFS was 19.7 months in the enzalutamide group and \n5.4 months in the placebo group. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAt the time of the primary analysis there were 1,633 patients randomised. \n \nFigure 6: Kaplan-Meier curves of radiographic progression-free survival in the PREVAIL study \n(intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n \nIn addition to the co-primary efficacy endpoints, statistically significant improvements were also \ndemonstrated in the following prospectively defined endpoints. \n \nThe median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 28.0 months for patients receiving \nenzalutamide and 10.8 months for patients receiving placebo [HR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.40), \np < 0.0001]. \n \nThe proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients with measurable disease at baseline who had an \nobjective soft tissue response was 58.8% (95% CI: 53.8, 63.7) compared with 5.0% (95% CI: 3.0, 7.7) \nof patients receiving placebo. The absolute difference in objective soft tissue response between \nenzalutamide and placebo arms was [53.9% (95% CI: 48.5, 59.1), p < 0.0001]. Complete responses \nwere reported in 19.7% of enzalutamide-treated patients compared with 1.0% of placebo-treated \npatients, and partial responses were reported in 39.1% of enzalutamide-treated patients versus 3.9% of \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nEnzalutamide significantly decreased the risk of the first skeletal-related event by 28% [HR = 0.718 \n(95% CI: 0.61, 0.84), p < 0.0001]. A skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery \nto bone for prostate cancer, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of \nantineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. The analysis included 587 skeletal-related events, of which \n389 events (66.3%) were radiation to bone, 79 events (13.5%) were spinal cord compression, 70 events \n(11.9%) were pathologic bone fracture, 45 events (7.6%) were change in antineoplastic therapy to treat \nbone pain, and 22 events (3.7%) were surgery to bone. \n \nPatients receiving enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined \nas a \u2265 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% \n(difference = 74.5%, p < 0.0001). \n \nThe median time to PSA progression per PCWG2 criteria was 11.2 months for patients treated with \nenzalutamide and 2.8 months for patients who received placebo [HR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.20), \np < 0.0001]. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nTreatment with enzalutamide decreased the risk of FACT-P degradation by 37.5% compared with \nplacebo (p < 0.0001). The median time to degradation in FACT-P was 11.3 months in the \nenzalutamide group and 5.6 months in the placebo group. \n \nCRPC2 (AFFIRM) study (patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received chemotherapy) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC who had received docetaxel \nand were using a LHRH analogue or had undergone orchiectomy were assessed in a randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 clinical trial. A total of 1199 patients were randomised 2:1 to \nreceive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 800) or placebo once daily \n(N = 399). Patients were allowed but not required to take prednisone (maximum daily dose allowed \nwas 10 mg prednisone or equivalent). Patients randomised to either arm were to continue treatment \nuntil disease progression (defined as confirmed radiographic progression or the occurrence of a \nskeletal-related event) and initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity, \nor withdrawal. \n \nThe following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the \ntreatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 41 - 92) and the racial distribution was 93% \nCaucasian, 4% Black, 1% Asian, and 2% Other. The ECOG performance score was 0 - 1 in 91.5% of \npatients and 2 in 8.5% of patients; 28% had a mean Brief Pain Inventory score of \u2265 4 (mean of \npatient\u2019s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours calculated for seven days prior to \nrandomisation). Most (91%) patients had metastases in bone and 23% had visceral lung and/or liver \ninvolvement. At study entry, 41% of randomised patients had PSA progression only, whereas 59% of \npatients had radiographic progression. Fifty-one percent (51%) of patients were on bisphosphonates at \nbaseline. \n \nThe AFFIRM study excluded patients with medical conditions that may predispose them to seizures \n(see section 4.8) and medicinal products known to decrease the seizure threshold, as well as clinically \nsignificant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent history of myocardial \ninfarction or unstable angina, New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure (unless ejection \nfraction was \u2265 45%), clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or AV block (without permanent \npacemaker). \n \nThe protocol pre-specified interim analysis after 520 deaths showed a statistically significant \nsuperiority in overall survival in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo (Table 4 and \nFigures 7 and 8).  \n \nTable 4: Overall survival of patients treated with either enzalutamide or placebo in the AFFIRM \nstudy (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n Enzalutamide (N = 800) Placebo (N = 399) \nDeaths (%)  308 (38.5%) 212 (53.1%) \nMedian survival (months) (95% CI) 18.4 (17.3, NR) 13.6 (11.3, 15.8) \nP-value1  p < 0.0001 \nHazard ratio (95% CI)2  0.63 (0.53, 0.75) \nNR = Not Reached. \n1.

The analysis involved 216 deaths without documented progression and 645 documented \nprogression events, of which 303 (47%) were due to soft tissue progression, 268 (42%) were due to \nbone lesion progression and 74 (11%) were due to both soft tissue and bone lesions. \n \nConfirmed PSA decline of 50% or 90% were 54.0% and 24.8%, respectively, for patients treated with \nenzalutamide and 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, for patients who received placebo (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to PSA progression was 8.3 months for patients treated with enzalutamide and 3.0 months \nfor patients who received placebo [HR = 0.25 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.30), p < 0.0001]. \n \nThe median time to first skeletal-related event was 16.7 months for patients treated with enzalutamide \nand 13.3 months for patients who received placebo [HR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.84), p < 0.0001]. A \nskeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, \nspinal cord compression or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. The analysis involved \n448 skeletal-related events, of which 277 events (62%) were radiation to bone, 95 events (21%) were \nspinal cord compression, 47 events (10%) were pathologic bone fracture, 36 events (8%) were change \nin antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain, and 7 events (2%) were surgery to bone. \n \n9785-CL-0410 study (enzalutamide post abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe study was a single-arm study in 214 patients with progressing metastatic CRPC who received \nenzalutamide (160 mg once daily) after at least 24 weeks of treatment with abiraterone acetate plus \nprednisone. Median rPFS (radiologic progression free survival, the study\u00b4s primary endpoint) was \n8.1 months (95% CI: 6.1, 8.3). Median OS was not reached. PSA Response (defined as \u2265 50% \ndecrease from baseline) was 22.4% (95% CI: 17.0, 28.6). For the 69 patients who previously received \nchemotherapy, median rPFS was 7.9 months (95% CI: 5.5, 10.8). PSA Response was 23.2% (95% CI: \n13.9, 34.9). For the 145 patients who had no previous chemotherapy, median rPFS was 8.1 months \n(95% CI: 5.7, 8.3). PSA Response was 22.1% (95% CI: 15.6, 29.7). \n \nAlthough there was a limited response in some patients from treatment with enzalutamide after \nabiraterone, the reason for this finding is currently unknown. The study design could neither identify \nthe patients who are likely to benefit, nor the order in which enzalutamide and abiraterone should be \noptimally sequenced. \n \nElderly \nOf the 3179 patients in the controlled clinical trials who received enzalutamide, 2518 patients (79%) \nwere 65 years and over and 1162 patients (37%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in \nsafety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. \n\nPaediatric population  \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nenzalutamide in all subsets of the paediatric population in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\nEnzalutamide is poorly water soluble. The solubility of enzalutamide is increased by caprylocaproyl \nmacrogolglycerides as emulsifier/surfactant. In preclinical studies, the absorption of enzalutamide was \nincreased when dissolved in caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have been evaluated in prostate cancer patients and in healthy \nmale subjects. The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is \n5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days), and steady state is achieved in approximately one month. With daily \noral administration, enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. Daily \nfluctuations in plasma concentrations are low (peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). Clearance of \nenzalutamide is primarily via hepatic metabolism, producing an active metabolite that is equally as \nactive as enzalutamide and circulates at approximately the same plasma concentration as enzalutamide.  \n\nAbsorption  \nMaximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of enzalutamide in patients are observed 1 to 2 hours after \nadministration. Based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated \nto be at least 84.2%. Enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters P-gp or BCRP. At \nsteady state, the mean Cmax values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite are 16.6 \u03bcg/mL (23% \ncoefficient of variation [CV]) and 12.7 \u03bcg/mL (30% CV), respectively. \n \nFood has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. In clinical trials, Xtandi was \nadministered without regard to food. \n\nDistribution  \nThe mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is \n110 L (29% CV). The volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body \nwater, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. Studies in rodents indicate that enzalutamide \nand its active metabolite can cross the blood brain barrier. \n  \nEnzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. The active metabolite is \n95% bound to plasma proteins. There was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and \nother highly bound medicinal products (warfarin, ibuprofen and salicylic acid) in vitro. \n\nBiotransformation  \nEnzalutamide is extensively metabolised. There are two major metabolites in human plasma: \nN-desmethyl enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative (inactive). Enzalutamide is \nmetabolised by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4/5 (see section 4.5), both of which play a \nrole in the formation of the active metabolite. In vitro, N-desmethyl enzalutamide is metabolised to the \ncarboxylic acid metabolite by carboxylesterase 1, which also plays a minor role in the metabolism of \nenzalutamide to the carboxylic acid metabolite. N-desmethyl enzalutamide was not metabolised by \nCYPs in vitro. \n \nUnder conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4, a moderate inducer of \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and has no clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 (see section 4.5). \n\nElimination  \nThe mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 L/h. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 14C-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days \npost dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of \nenzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as \nunchanged enzalutamide). \n \nIn vitro data indicate that enzalutamide is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1; and \nN-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate for P-gp or BCRP. \n \nIn vitro data indicate that enzalutamide and its major metabolites do not inhibit the following \ntransporters at clinically relevant concentrations: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, or OAT1. \n\n\n\n21 \n\nLinearity  \nNo major deviations from dose proportionality are observed over the dose range 40 to 160 mg. The \nsteady-state Cmin values of enzalutamide and the active metabolite in individual patients remained \nconstant during more than one year of chronic therapy, demonstrating time-linear pharmacokinetics \nonce steady-state is achieved. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed. Patients with serum \ncreatinine > 177 \u03bcmol/L (2 mg/dL) were excluded from clinical trials. Based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with calculated creatinine \nclearance (CrCL) values \u2265 30 mL/min (estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula). Enzalutamide \nhas not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) or end-stage \nrenal disease, and caution is advised when treating these patients. It is unlikely that enzalutamide will \nbe significantly removed by intermittent haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment did not have a pronounced effect on the total exposure to enzalutamide or its \nactive metabolite. The half-life of enzalutamide was however doubled in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment compared with healthy controls (10.4 days compared to 4.7 days), possibly related to an \nincreased tissue distribution. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (N = 6), \nmoderate (N = 8) or severe (N = 8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B or C, respectively) and \nin 22 matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Following a single oral 160 mg dose of \nenzalutamide, the AUC and Cmax for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% \nand 24%, respectively, the AUC and Cmax of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment \nincreased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax of enzalutamide in \nsubjects with severe impairment increased by 5% and decreased by 41%, respectively, compared to \nhealthy control subjects. For the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the \nAUC and Cmax in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, the AUC \nand Cmax in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, \nand the AUC and Cmax in subjects with severe hepatic impairment increased by 34% and decreased by \n27%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. \n \nRace \nMost patients in the controlled clinical trials (> 74%) were Caucasian. Based on pharmacokinetic data \nfrom studies in Japanese and Chinese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically relevant \ndifferences in exposure among the populations. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races. \n \nElderly \nNo clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the elderly \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\nEnzalutamide treatment of pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of embryo-fetal deaths and \nexternal and skeletal changes. Reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with enzalutamide, \nbut in studies in rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13, and 39 weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, \nand hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the reproductive system were noted, consistent with the \npharmacological activity of enzalutamide. In studies in mice (4 weeks), rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs \n(4, 13, and 39 weeks), changes in the reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases \nin organ weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymis. Leydig cell hypertrophy and/or \nhyperplasia were observed in mice (4 weeks) and dogs (39 weeks). Additional changes to reproductive \ntissues included hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the pituitary gland and atrophy in seminal vesicles in rats \nand testicular hypospermia and seminiferous tubule degeneration in dogs. Gender differences were \nnoted in rat mammary glands (male atrophy and female lobular hyperplasia). Changes in the \n\n\n\n22 \n\nreproductive organs in both species were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide \nand reversed or partially resolved after an 8-week recovery period. There were no other important \nchanges in clinical pathology or histopathology in any other organ system, including the liver, in either \nspecies. \n \nStudies in pregnant rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to fetuses. \nAfter oral administration of radiolabeled 14C-enzalutamide to rats on day 14 of pregnancy at a dose of \n30 mg/kg (~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the \nfetus was reached 4 hours after administration and was lower than that in the maternal plasma with \ntissue/plasma ratio of 0.27. The radioactivity in the fetus decreased to 0.08 times the maximum \nconcentration at 72 hours after administration. \n \nStudies in lactating rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are secreted in rat milk. \nAfter oral administration of radiolabeled 14C-enzalutamide to lactating rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg \n(~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the milk was \nreached 4 hours after administration and was up to 3.54-fold higher than that in the maternal plasma. \nStudy results also have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to infant rat \ntissues via milk and subsequently eliminated. \n \nEnzalutamide was negative for genotoxicity in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. In a 6-\nmonth study in transgenic rasH2 mice, enzalutamide did not show carcinogenic potential (absence of \nneoplastic findings) at doses up to 20 mg/kg per day (AUC24h ~317 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL), which resulted in \nplasma exposure levels similar to the clinical exposure (AUC24h 322 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL) in mCRPC patients \nreceiving 160 mg, daily.  \n \nDaily dosing of rats for two years with enzalutamide at 10\u2013100 mg/kg/day produced an increased \nincidence of several, mostly benign, tumour types. The most prominent of these were benign Leydig \ncell tumours, urothelium papilloma, and carcinoma of urinary bladder. Benign Leydig cell tumours are \nexpected based on the pharmacological properties of this antiandrogen drug and not considered \nrelevant to humans. Some urothelium papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder is expected in rats \nbased on the horizontal structure of the rat urinary bladder, which can encounter concentrated urine \nand prolonged irritation from calculi. In the study, calculi and crystals were observed in rat urinary \nbladders. However, no obvious mechanistic rationale to explain specifically this malignancy can be \nestablished, and taking into account that exposure levels, based on AUC, achieved in the study, for \nenzalutamide plus its metabolites, were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the \nrecommended dose of 160 mg/day, urinary bladder carcinogenicity potential of enzalutamide in \nhumans cannot be excluded. Other tumours, which are also potentially related to the primary \npharmacology include fibroadenoma of mammary glands and benign thymoma of thymus in males, \nbenign granulosa cell tumours of ovaries in females, and adenoma of pituitary pars distalis in both \nsexes. The exposure levels achieved in this study in male rats at Week 26 at 100 mg/kg per day for \nenzalutamide plus its active metabolites M1 and M2 (AUC24: enzalutamide ~457 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, M1 ~321 \n\u00b5g\u2022h/mL, M2 ~35 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL) were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the \nrecommended dose (160 mg/day) of enzalutamide (AUC24: enzalutamide ~322 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, M1 ~193 \n\u00b5g\u2022h/mL, M2 ~278 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL).  \n \nEnzalutamide was not phototoxic in vitro. \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n\nXtandi - 40 mg film-coated tablets \nXtandi - 80 mg film-coated tablets \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nXtandi - 40 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 40 mg of enzalutamide. \n \nXtandi - 80 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 80 mg of enzalutamide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \nXtandi - 40 mg film-coated tablets \nYellow round \u2013 film-coated tablets, debossed with E 40. \n \nXtandi - 80 mg film-coated tablets \nYellow oval \u2013 film-coated tablets, debossed with E 80. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\nXtandi is indicated for: \n\u2022 the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \n\n(CRPC) (see section 5.1). \n\u2022 the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly \n\nsymptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet \nclinically indicated (see section 5.1). \n\n\u2022 the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after \ndocetaxel therapy. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTreatment with enzalutamide should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced \nin the medical treatment of prostate cancer. \n\nPosology  \nThe recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg film-coated tablets or two \n80 mg film-coated tablets) as a single oral daily dose. \n \nMedical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be \ncontinued during treatment of patients not surgically castrated. \n \nIf a patient misses taking Xtandi at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as \npossible to the usual time. If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the \nfollowing day with the usual daily dose. \n \nIf a patient experiences a \u2265 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction, dosing should be \nwithheld for one week or until symptoms improve to \u2264 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced \ndose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nConcomitant use with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If patients must be \nco-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg \nonce daily. If co-administration of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose \nshould be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (see section 4.5). \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh Class A, B or C, respectively). An increased half-life of enzalutamide has however been \nobserved in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nCaution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population  \nThere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of \nadult men with CRPC. \n\nMethod of administration  \nXtandi is for oral use. The film-coated tablets should not be cut, crushed or chewed but should be \nswallowed whole with water, and can be taken with or without food. \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \nWomen who are or may become pregnant (see sections 4.6 and 6.6). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\nRisk of seizure \nUse of enzalutamide has been associated with seizure (see section 4.8). The decision to continue \ntreatment in patients who develop seizure should be taken case by case. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \nThere have been rare reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients \nreceiving Xtandi (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present \nwith rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, blindness, and other visual \nand neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires \nconfirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discontinuation of \nXtandi in patients who develop PRES is recommended. \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \nEnzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and may lead to loss of efficacy of many commonly used \nmedicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). A review of concomitant medicinal products should \ntherefore be conducted when initiating enzalutamide treatment. Concomitant use of enzalutamide with \nmedicinal products that are sensitive substrates of many metabolising enzymes or transporters (see \nsection 4.5) should generally be avoided if their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, \nand if dose adjustments cannot easily be performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma \nconcentrations. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nCo-administration with warfarin and coumarin-like anticoagulants should be avoided. If Xtandi is \nco-administered with an anticoagulant metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin or acenocoumarol), \nadditional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring should be conducted (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \nCaution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as enzalutamide has not been studied in \nthis patient population. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nAn increased half-life of enzalutamide has been observed in patients with severe hepatic impairment, \npossibly related to increased tissue distribution. The clinical relevance of this observation remains \nunknown. A prolonged time to reach steady state concentrations is however anticipated, and the time \nto maximum pharmacological effect as well as time for onset and decline of enzyme induction (see \nsection 4.5) may be increased. \n \nRecent cardiovascular disease \nThe phase 3 studies excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction (in the past 6 months) or \nunstable angina (in the past 3 months), New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III or IV heart \nfailure except if Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \u2265 45%, bradycardia or uncontrolled \nhypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi is prescribed in these patients. \n \nAndrogen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval \nIn patients with a history of or risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products that might prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5) physicians should assess the \nbenefit risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to initiating Xtandi. \n \nUse with chemotherapy \nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been \nestablished. Co-administration of enzalutamide has no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of intravenous docetaxel (see section 4.5); however, an increase in the occurrence of \ndocetaxel-induced neutropenia cannot be excluded. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, rash, or face, tongue, \nlip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide (see section 4.8). \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect enzalutamide exposures \n \nCYP2C8 inhibitors  \nCYP2C8 plays an important role in the elimination of enzalutamide and in the formation of its active \nmetabolite. Following oral administration of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil (600 mg twice \ndaily) to healthy male subjects, the AUC of enzalutamide increased by 326% while Cmax of \nenzalutamide decreased by 18%. For the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active \nmetabolite, the AUC increased by 77% while Cmax decreased by 19%. Strong inhibitors (e.g. \ngemfibrozil) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enzalutamide treatment. If \npatients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be \nreduced to 80 mg once daily (see section 4.2). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors  \nCYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. Following oral administration of the \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily) to healthy male subjects, the AUC of \nenzalutamide increased by 41% while Cmax was unchanged. For the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus \nthe unbound active metabolite, the AUC increased by 27% while Cmax was again unchanged. No dose \nadjustment is necessary when Xtandi is co-administered with inhibitors of CYP3A4. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nCYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing oral administration of the moderate CYP2C8 and strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin (600 mg \nonce daily) to healthy male subjects, the AUC of enzalutamide plus the active metabolite decreased by \n37% while Cmax remained unchanged. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi is co-\nadministered with inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. \n \nPotential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products \n \nEnzyme induction \nEnzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and \ntransporters; therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are substrates of \nenzymes or transporters is expected. The reduction in plasma concentrations can be substantial, and \nlead to lost or reduced clinical effect. There is also a risk of increased formation of active metabolites. \nEnzymes that may be induced include CYP3A in the liver and gut, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and \nuridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The \ntransport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as well, e.g. multidrug \nresistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and the organic anion \ntransporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). \n \nIn vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer \nof CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Co-administration of enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) with single oral \ndoses of sensitive CYP substrates in prostate cancer patients resulted in an 86% decrease in the AUC \nof midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), a 56% decrease in the AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), \nand a 70% decrease in the AUC of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate). UGT1A1 may have been \ninduced as well. In a clinical study in patients with metastatic CRPC, Xtandi (160 mg once daily) had \nno clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered docetaxel \n(75 mg/m2 by infusion every 3 weeks). The AUC of docetaxel decreased by 12% [geometric mean \nratio (GMR) = 0.882 (90% CI: 0.767, 1.02)] while Cmax decreased by 4% [GMR = 0.963 (90% CI: \n0.834, 1.11)].  \n \nInteractions with certain medicinal products that are eliminated through metabolism or active transport \nare expected. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are \nnot easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal \nproducts are to be avoided or used with caution. The risk for liver injury after paracetamol \nadministration is suspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers. \n \nGroups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to: \n \n\u2022 Analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, tramadol) \n\u2022 Antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) \n\u2022 Anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) \n\u2022 Antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) \n\u2022 Antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) \n\u2022 Antithrombotics (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin, clopidogrel) \n\u2022 Betablockers (e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol) \n\u2022 Calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) \n\u2022 Cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) \n\u2022 Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) \n\u2022 HIV antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) \n\u2022 Hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) \n\u2022 Immunosuppressant (e.g. tacrolimus) \n\u2022 Proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) \n\u2022 Statins metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin) \n\u2022 Thyroid agents (e.g. levothyroxine) \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThe full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 month after the start \nof treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some \ninduction effects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of \nCYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible loss of \npharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during \nthe first month of enzalutamide treatment and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. In \nconsideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days, see section 5.2), effects on enzymes may \npersist for one month or longer after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the \nconcomitant medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. \n \nCYP1A2 and CYP2C8 substrates \nEnzalutamide (160 mg once daily) did not cause a clinically relevant change in the AUC or Cmax of \ncaffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) or pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate). The AUC of pioglitazone increased \nby 20% while Cmax decreased by 18%. The AUC and Cmax of caffeine decreased by 11% and 4% \nrespectively. No dose adjustment is indicated when a CYP1A2 or CYP2C8 substrate is \nco-administered with Xtandi. \n \nP-gp substrates  \nIn vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp. The effect of \nenzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical \nuse, enzalutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). \nMedicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, \ndabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with \nXtandi and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations. \n \nBCRP, MRP2, OAT3 and OCT1 substrates  \nBased on in vitro data, inhibition of BCRP and MRP2 (in the intestine), as well as organic anion \ntransporter 3 (OAT3) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) (systemically) cannot be excluded. \nTheoretically, induction of these transporters is also possible, and the net effect is presently unknown.  \n \nMedicinal products which prolong the QT interval  \nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, the concomitant use of Xtandi with \nmedicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal products able to induce Torsade de \npointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, \nibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be \ncarefully evaluated (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of food on enzalutamide exposures \nFood has no clinically significant effect on the extent of exposure to enzalutamide. In clinical trials, \nXtandi was administered without regard to food. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \nThere are no human data on the use of Xtandi in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use in \nwomen of childbearing potential. This medicine may cause harm to the unborn child or potential loss \nof pregnancy if taken by women who are pregnant (see sections 4.3, 5.3, and 6.6). \n \nContraception in males and females \nIt is not known whether enzalutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required \nduring and for 3 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexual activity \nwith a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing \npotential, a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after \ntreatment. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPregnancy \nEnzalutamide is not for use in women. Enzalutamide is contraindicated in women who are or may \nbecome pregnant (see sections 4.3, 5.3, and 6.6). \n\nBreast-feeding  \nEnzalutamide is not for use in women. It is not known if enzalutamide is present in human milk. \nEnzalutamide and/or its metabolites are secreted in rat milk (see section 5.3). \n\nFertility  \nAnimal studies showed that enzalutamide affected the reproductive system in male rats and dogs (see \nsection 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\nXtandi has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines as psychiatric and neurologic \nevents including seizure have been reported (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised of the \npotential risk of experiencing a psychiatric or neurological event while driving or operating machines. \nNo studies to evaluate the effects of enzalutamide on the ability to drive and use machines have been \nconducted. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \nThe most common adverse reactions are asthenia/fatigue, hot flush, fractures, and hypertension. Other \nimportant adverse reactions include fall, cognitive disorder, and neutropenia. \n \nSeizure occurred in 0.4% of enzalutamide-treated patients, 0.1% of placebo-treated patients and 0.3% \nin bicalutamide-treated patients. \n \nRare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome have been reported in enzalutamide-\ntreated patients (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency \ncategories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions identified in controlled clinical trials and post-marketing \n\nMedDRA System organ class  Adverse reaction and frequency \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon: leucopenia, neutropenia \nNot known*: thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders Not known*: face oedema, tongue oedema, lip oedema, \npharyngeal oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common: anxiety \nUncommon: visual hallucination \n\nNervous system disorders Common: headache, memory impairment, amnesia,  \ndisturbance in attention, restless legs syndrome \nUncommon: cognitive disorder, seizure\u00a5 \nNot known*: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n\nCardiac disorders Common: ischemic heart disease\u2020 \nNot known*: QT-prolongation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nVascular disorders Very common: hot flush, hypertension \nGastrointestinal disorders Not known*: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon: dry skin, pruritus \nNot known*: rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common: fractures\u2021 \nNot known*: myalgia, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, back \npain \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorder \n\nCommon: gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common: asthenia, fatigue \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nCommon: fall \n\n*  Spontaneous reports from post-marketing experience \n\n\u00a5  As evaluated by narrow SMQs of \u2018Convulsions\u2019 including convulsion, grand mal convulsion, complex partial seizures, \npartial seizures, and status epilepticus.

Dose appears to be an important predictor of the \nrisk of seizure, as reflected by preclinical data, and data from a dose-escalation study. In the controlled \nclinical studies, patients with prior seizure or risk factors for seizure were excluded. \n \nIn the 9785-CL-0403 (UPWARD) single-arm trial to assess incidence of seizure in patients with \npredisposing factors for seizure (whereof 1.6% had a history of seizures), 8 of 366 (2.2%) patients \ntreated with enzalutamide experienced a seizure. The median duration of treatment was 9.3 months. \n \nThe mechanism by which enzalutamide may lower the seizure threshold is not known, but could be \nrelated to data from in vitro studies showing that enzalutamide and its active metabolite bind to and \ncan inhibit the activity of the GABA-gated chloride channel. \n \nIschemic Heart Disease \n\n\n\n31 \n\nIn randomized placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred in 2.5% of patients \ntreated with enzalutamide plus ADT compared to 1.3 % patients treated with placebo plus ADT.  \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\nThere is no antidote for enzalutamide. In the event of an overdose, treatment with enzalutamide should \nbe stopped and general supportive measures initiated taking into consideration the half-life of 5.8 days. \nPatients may be at increased risk of seizures following an overdose. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: hormone antagonists and related agents, anti-androgens, ATC code: \nL02BB04. \n\nMechanism of action \nProstate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to inhibition of androgen receptor \nsignalling. Despite low or even undetectable levels of serum androgen, androgen receptor signalling \ncontinues to promote disease progression. Stimulation of tumour cell growth via the androgen receptor \nrequires nuclear localization and DNA binding. Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling \ninhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. Enzalutamide \ncompetitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, and consequently; inhibits nuclear \ntranslocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with \nDNA even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to \nanti-androgens. Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce \ncancer cell death and tumour regression. In preclinical studies enzalutamide lacks androgen receptor \nagonist activity. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \nIn a phase 3 clinical trial (AFFIRM) of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with docetaxel, 54% of \npatients treated with enzalutamide, versus 1.5% of patients who received placebo, had at least a 50% \ndecline from baseline in PSA levels. \n \nIn another phase 3 clinical trial (PREVAIL) in chemo-na\u00efve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide \ndemonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined as a \u2265 50% reduction from \nbaseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% (difference = 74.5%, \np < 0.0001). \n \nIn a phase 2 clinical trial (TERRAIN) in chemo-na\u00efve patients, patients receiving enzalutamide \ndemonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined as a \u2265 50% reduction from \nbaseline), compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 82.1% versus 20.9% (difference = 61.2%, \np < 0.0001) \n \nIn a single arm trial (9785-CL-0410) of patients previously treated with at least 24 weeks of \nabiraterone (plus prednisone), 22.4% had a \u2265 50% decrease from baseline in PSA levels. According to \nprior chemotherapy history, the results proportion of patients with a \u2265 50% decrease in PSA levels \nwere 22.1% and 23.2%, for the no prior chemotherapy and prior chemotherapy patient groups, \nrespectively. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nIn the MDV3100-09 clinical trial (STRIVE) of non-metastatic and metastatic CRPC, patients receiving \nenzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total confirmed PSA response rate (defined as a \n\u2265 50% reduction from baseline) compared with patients receiving bicalutamide, 81.3% versus 31.3% \n(difference = 50.0%, p < 0.0001). \n \nIn the MDV3100-14 clinical trial (PROSPER) of non-metastatic CRPC, patients receiving \nenzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher confirmed PSA response rate (defined as a \u2265 50% \nreduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 76.3% versus 2.4% \n(difference = 73.9%, p < 0.0001). \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \nEfficacy of enzalutamide was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre phase 3 \nclinical studies [MDV3100-14 (PROSPER), CRPC2 (AFFIRM), MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL)] of \npatients with progressive prostate cancer who had failed androgen deprivation therapy [LHRH \nanalogue or after bilateral orchiectomy]. The PREVAIL study enrolled metastatic CRPC \nchemotherapy-na\u00efve patients; whereas the AFFIRM study enrolled metastatic CRPC patients who had \nreceived prior docetaxel; and the PROSPER study enrolled patients with non-metastatic CRPC. All \npatients continued on a LHRH analogue or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. In the active treatment \narm, Xtandi was administered orally at a dose of 160 mg daily. In the three clinical trials, patients \nreceived placebo in the control arm and patients were allowed, but not required, to take prednisone \n(maximum daily dose allowed was 10 mg prednisone or equivalent). \n \nChanges in PSA serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. Therefore, \nin the three studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until \ndiscontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study. \n \nMDV3100-14 (PROSPER) study (patients with non-metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe PROSPER study enrolled 1401 patients with asymptomatic, high-risk non-metastatic CRPC who \ncontinued on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; defined as LHRH analogue or prior bilateral \norchiectomy). Patients were required to have a PSA doubling time \u2264 10 months, PSA \u2265 2 ng/mL, and \nconfirmation of non-metastatic disease by blinded independent central review (BICR). \n \nPatients with a history of mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA Class I or II), and patients taking \nmedicinal products associated with lowering the seizure threshold were allowed. Patients were \nexcluded with a previous history of seizure, a condition that might predispose them to seizure, or \ncertain prior treatments for prostate cancer (i.e., chemotherapy, ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, \naminoglutethimide and/or enzalutamide). \n \nPatients were randomised 2:1 to receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 933) \nor placebo (N = 468). Patients were stratified by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Doubling Time \n(PSADT) (< 6 months or \u2265 6 months) and the use of bone-targeting agents (yes or no). \nThe demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. \nThe median age at randomisation was 74 years in the enzalutamide arm and 73 years in the placebo \narm. Most patients (approximately 71%) in the study were Caucasian; 16% were Asian and 2% were \nBlack. Eighty-one percent (81%) of patients had an ECOG performance status score of 0 and 19% \npatients had an ECOG performance status of 1. \n \nMetastasis-free survival (MFS) was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to \nradiographic progression or death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of \nradiographic progression, whichever occurred first. Key secondary endpoints assessed in the study \nwere time to PSA progression, time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy (TTA), overall survival \n(OS). Additional secondary endpoints included time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and \nchemotherapy-free survival. See results below (Table 2).  \n \nEnzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant 71% reduction in the relative risk of radiographic \nprogression or death compared to placebo [HR = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.35), p < 0.0001]. Median MFS \n\n\n\n33 \n\nwas 36.6 months (95% CI: 33.1, NR) on the enzalutamide arm versus 14.7 months (95% CI: 14.2, \n15.0) on the placebo arm. Consistent MFS results were also observed in all pre-specified patient sub-\ngroups including PSADT (< 6 months or \u2265 6 months), demographic region (North America, Europe, \nrest of world), age (< 75 or \u2265 75), use of a prior bone-targeting agent (yes or no). \n \nTable 2: Summary of efficacy results in the PROSPER study (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n Enzalutamide \nN = 933 \n\nPlacebo \nN = 468 \n\nPrimary Endpoint \nMetastasis-free survival \n\nNumber of Events (%) 219 (23.5) 228 (48.7) \nMedian, months (95% CI)1 36.6 (33.1, NR) 14.7 (14.2, 15.0) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI)2  0.29 (0.24, 0.35) \nP-value3  p < 0.0001 \n\nKey Secondary Efficacy Endpoints \nTime to PSA progression \nNumber of Events (%)  208 (22.3) 324 (69.2) \nMedian, months (95% CI)1 37.2 (33.1, NR) 3.9 (3.8, 4.0) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI)2 0.07 (0.05, 0.08) \nP-value3 p < 0.0001 \n\nTime to first use of new antineoplastic therapy \nNumber of Events (%)  142 (15.2) 226 (48.3) \nMedian, months (95% CI)1 39.6 (37.7, NR) 17.7 (16.2, 19.7) \nHazard Ratio (95% CI)2 0.21 (0.17, 0.26) \nP-value3 p < 0.0001 \nNR = Not reached. \n1.

The median was not reached in either \n\n\n\n34 \n\ntreatment group and neither analysis showed a statistically significant difference between treatment \narms. \n \nEnzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant 93% reduction in the relative risk of PSA \nprogression compared to placebo [HR = 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.08), p < 0.0001]. Median time to PSA \nprogression was 37.2 months (95% CI: 33.1, NR) on the enzalutamide arm versus 3.9 months (95% \nCI: 3.8, 4.0) on the placebo arm. \n \nEnzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the time to first use of new \nantineoplastic therapy compared to placebo [HR = 0.21 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.26), p < 0.0001]. Median \ntime to first use of new antineoplastic therapy was 39.6 months (95% CI: 37.7, NR) on the \nenzalutamide arm versus 17.7 months (95% CI: 16.2, 19.7) on the placebo arm. \n \n\n \nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curves of time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy in the \nPROSPER study (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n \nMDV3100-09 (STRIVE) study (chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with non-metastatic/metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe STRIVE study enrolled 396 non-metastatic or metastatic CRPC patients who had serologic or \nradiographic disease progression despite primary androgen deprivation therapy who were randomised \nto receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 198) or bicalutamide at a dose of \n50 mg once daily (N = 198). PFS was the primary endpoint defined as the time from randomisation to \nthe earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression, PSA progression, or death on study. \nMedian PFS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 16.5, not reached) in the enzalutamide group versus \n5.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, 8.1) in the bicalutamide group [HR = 0.24 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.32), p < 0.0001]. \nConsistent benefit of enzalutamide over bicalutamide on PFS was observed in all pre-specified patient \nsubgroups. For the non-metastatic subgroup (N = 139) a total of 19 out of 70 (27.1%) patients treated \nwith enzalutamide and 49 out of 69 (71.0%) patients treated with bicalutamide had PFS events \n(68 total events). The hazard ratio was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.42) and the median time to a PFS event \nwas not reached in the enzalutamide group versus 8.6 months in the bicalutamide group. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves of progression-free survival in the STRIVE study (intent-to-\ntreat analysis) \n\n \n9785-CL-0222 (TERRAIN) study (chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe TERRAIN study enrolled 375 chemo- and antiandrogen-therapy na\u00efve patients with metastatic \nCRPC who were randomised to receive either enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 184) \nor bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg once daily (N = 191). Median PFS was 15.7 months for patients on \nenzalutamide versus 5.8 months for patients on bicalutamide [HR = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.57), p < \n0.0001]. Progression-free survival was defined as objective evidence of radiographic disease \nprogression by independent central review, skeletal-related events, initiation of new antineoplastic \ntherapy or death by any cause, whichever occurred first. Consistent PFS benefit was observed across \nall pre-specified patient subgroups. \n \nMDV3100-03 (PREVAIL) study (chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with metastatic CRPC) \n \nA total of 1717 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients were randomised \n1:1 to receive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 872) or placebo orally \nonce daily (N = 845). Patients with visceral disease, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart \nfailure (NYHA Class I or II), and patients taking medicinal products associated with lowering the \nseizure threshold were allowed. Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might \npredispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. \nStudy treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-\nrelated event, or clinical progression) and the initiation of either a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an \ninvestigational agent, or until unacceptable toxicity. \n \nPatient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. \nThe median age was 71 years (range 42 - 93) and the racial distribution was 77% Caucasian, \n10% Asian, 2% Black and 11% other or unknown races. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of patients had an \nECOG performance status score of 0 and 32% patients had an ECOG performance status of 1. \nBaseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients and 2 - 3 (mildly symptomatic) \nin 32% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (worst pain over past 24 hours \non a scale of 0 to 10). Approximately 45% of patients had measurable soft tissue disease at study \nentry, and 12% of patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases. \n \nCo-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival \n(rPFS). In addition to the co-primary endpoints, benefit was also assessed using time to initiation of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy, best overall soft tissue response, time to first skeletal-related event, PSA \nresponse (\u2265 50% decrease from baseline), time to PSA progression, and time to FACT-P total score \ndegradation. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nRadiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies as defined by \nProstate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria (for bone lesions) and/or Response \nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). Analysis of rPFS \nutilised centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression. \n \nAt the pre-specified interim analysis for overall survival when 540 deaths were observed, treatment \nwith enzalutamide demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to \ntreatment with placebo with a 29.4% reduction in risk of death [HR = 0.706 (95% CI: 0.60; 0.84), \np < 0.0001].  An updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed. Results \nfrom this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis (Table 3, Figure 4). At the \nupdated analysis 52% of enzalutamide-treated and 81% of placebo-treated patients had received \nsubsequent therapies for metastatic CRPC that may prolong overall survival. \n \nTable 3: Overall survival of patients treated with either enzalutamide or placebo in the \nPREVAIL study (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n \nEnzalutamide \n\n(N = 872) \nPlacebo  \n\n(N = 845) \nPre-specified interim analysis   \n\nNumber of deaths (%) 241 (27.6%) 299 (35.4%) \nMedian survival, months (95% CI) 32.4 (30.1, NR) 30.2 (28.0, NR) \n\n   P-value1 p < 0.0001 \n   Hazard ratio (95% CI)2 0.71 (0.60, 0.84) \nUpdated survival analysis   \n\nNumber of deaths (%) 368 (42.2%) 416 (49.2%) \nMedian survival, months (95% CI) 35.3 (32.2, NR) 31.3 (28.8, 34.2) \nP-value1 p = 0.0002 \n\n   Hazard ratio (95% CI)2 0.77 (0.67, 0.88) \nNR = Not reached. \n1.

One hundred and eighteen (14%) enzalutamide-treated patients and \n321 (40%) of placebo-treated patients had an event. The median rPFS was not reached (95% CI: 13.8, \nnot reached) in the enzalutamide-treated group and was 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.4) in the placebo-\ntreated group (Figure 6). Consistent rPFS benefit was observed across all pre-specified patient \nsubgroups (e.g. age, baseline ECOG performance, baseline PSA and LDH, Gleason score at diagnosis, \nand visceral disease at screening). A pre-specified follow-up rPFS analysis based on the investigator \nassessment of radiographic progression demonstrated a statistically significant improvement between \nthe treatment groups with a 69.3% reduction in risk of radiographic progression or death [HR = 0.31 \n(95% CI: 0.27, 0.35), p < 0.0001]. The median rPFS was 19.7 months in the enzalutamide group and \n5.4 months in the placebo group. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nAt the time of the primary analysis there were 1,633 patients randomised. \n \nFigure 6: Kaplan-Meier curves of radiographic progression-free survival in the PREVAIL study \n(intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n \nIn addition to the co-primary efficacy endpoints, statistically significant improvements were also \ndemonstrated in the following prospectively defined endpoints. \n \nThe median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 28.0 months for patients receiving \nenzalutamide and 10.8 months for patients receiving placebo [HR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.40), \np < 0.0001]. \n \nThe proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients with measurable disease at baseline who had an \nobjective soft tissue response was 58.8% (95% CI: 53.8, 63.7) compared with 5.0% (95% CI: 3.0, 7.7) \nof patients receiving placebo. The absolute difference in objective soft tissue response between \nenzalutamide and placebo arms was [53.9% (95% CI: 48.5, 59.1), p < 0.0001]. Complete responses \nwere reported in 19.7% of enzalutamide-treated patients compared with 1.0% of placebo-treated \npatients, and partial responses were reported in 39.1% of enzalutamide-treated patients versus 3.9% of \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nEnzalutamide significantly decreased the risk of the first skeletal-related event by 28% [HR = 0.718 \n(95% CI: 0.61, 0.84), p < 0.0001]. A skeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery \nto bone for prostate cancer, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of \nantineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. The analysis included 587 skeletal-related events, of which \n389 events (66.3%) were radiation to bone, 79 events (13.5%) were spinal cord compression, 70 events \n(11.9%) were pathologic bone fracture, 45 events (7.6%) were change in antineoplastic therapy to treat \nbone pain, and 22 events (3.7%) were surgery to bone. \n \nPatients receiving enzalutamide demonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined \nas a \u2265 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 78.0% versus 3.5% \n(difference = 74.5%, p < 0.0001). \n \nThe median time to PSA progression per PCWG2 criteria was 11.2 months for patients treated with \nenzalutamide and 2.8 months for patients who received placebo [HR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.20), \np < 0.0001]. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nTreatment with enzalutamide decreased the risk of FACT-P degradation by 37.5% compared with \nplacebo (p < 0.0001). The median time to degradation in FACT-P was 11.3 months in the \nenzalutamide group and 5.6 months in the placebo group. \n \nCRPC2 (AFFIRM) study (patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received chemotherapy) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC who had received docetaxel \nand were using a LHRH analogue or had undergone orchiectomy were assessed in a randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 clinical trial. A total of 1199 patients were randomised 2:1 to \nreceive either enzalutamide orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 800) or placebo once daily \n(N = 399). Patients were allowed but not required to take prednisone (maximum daily dose allowed \nwas 10 mg prednisone or equivalent). Patients randomised to either arm were to continue treatment \nuntil disease progression (defined as confirmed radiographic progression or the occurrence of a \nskeletal-related event) and initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity, \nor withdrawal. \n \nThe following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the \ntreatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 41 - 92) and the racial distribution was 93% \nCaucasian, 4% Black, 1% Asian, and 2% Other. The ECOG performance score was 0 - 1 in 91.5% of \npatients and 2 in 8.5% of patients; 28% had a mean Brief Pain Inventory score of \u2265 4 (mean of \npatient\u2019s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours calculated for seven days prior to \nrandomisation). Most (91%) patients had metastases in bone and 23% had visceral lung and/or liver \ninvolvement. At study entry, 41% of randomised patients had PSA progression only, whereas 59% of \npatients had radiographic progression. Fifty-one percent (51%) of patients were on bisphosphonates at \nbaseline. \n \nThe AFFIRM study excluded patients with medical conditions that may predispose them to seizures \n(see section 4.8) and medicinal products known to decrease the seizure threshold, as well as clinically \nsignificant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent history of myocardial \ninfarction or unstable angina, New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure (unless ejection \nfraction was \u2265 45%), clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or AV block (without permanent \npacemaker). \n \nThe protocol pre-specified interim analysis after 520 deaths showed a statistically significant \nsuperiority in overall survival in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo (Table 4 and \nFigures 7 and 8).  \n \nTable 4: Overall survival of patients treated with either enzalutamide or placebo in the AFFIRM \nstudy (intent-to-treat analysis) \n\n Enzalutamide (N = 800) Placebo (N = 399) \nDeaths (%)  308 (38.5%) 212 (53.1%) \nMedian survival (months) (95% CI) 18.4 (17.3, NR) 13.6 (11.3, 15.8) \nP-value1  p < 0.0001 \nHazard ratio (95% CI)2  0.63 (0.53, 0.75) \nNR = Not Reached. \n1.

The analysis involved 216 deaths without documented progression and 645 documented \nprogression events, of which 303 (47%) were due to soft tissue progression, 268 (42%) were due to \nbone lesion progression and 74 (11%) were due to both soft tissue and bone lesions. \n \nConfirmed PSA decline of 50% or 90% were 54.0% and 24.8%, respectively, for patients treated with \nenzalutamide and 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively, for patients who received placebo (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to PSA progression was 8.3 months for patients treated with enzalutamide and 3.0 months \nfor patients who received placebo [HR = 0.25 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.30), p < 0.0001]. \n \nThe median time to first skeletal-related event was 16.7 months for patients treated with enzalutamide \nand 13.3 months for patients who received placebo [HR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.84), p < 0.0001]. A \nskeletal-related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, \nspinal cord compression or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain. The analysis involved \n448 skeletal-related events, of which 277 events (62%) were radiation to bone, 95 events (21%) were \nspinal cord compression, 47 events (10%) were pathologic bone fracture, 36 events (8%) were change \nin antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain, and 7 events (2%) were surgery to bone. \n \n9785-CL-0410 study (enzalutamide post abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC) \n \nThe study was a single-arm study in 214 patients with progressing metastatic CRPC who received \nenzalutamide (160 mg once daily) after at least 24 weeks of treatment with abiraterone acetate plus \nprednisone. Median rPFS (radiologic progression free survival, the study\u00b4s primary endpoint) was \n8.1 months (95% CI: 6.1, 8.3). Median OS was not reached. PSA Response (defined as \u2265 50% \ndecrease from baseline) was 22.4% (95% CI: 17.0, 28.6). For the 69 patients who previously received \nchemotherapy, median rPFS was 7.9 months (95% CI: 5.5, 10.8). PSA Response was 23.2% (95% CI: \n13.9, 34.9). For the 145 patients who had no previous chemotherapy, median rPFS was 8.1 months \n(95% CI: 5.7, 8.3). PSA Response was 22.1% (95% CI: 15.6, 29.7). \n \nAlthough there was a limited response in some patients from treatment with enzalutamide after \nabiraterone, the reason for this finding is currently unknown. The study design could neither identify \nthe patients who are likely to benefit, nor the order in which enzalutamide and abiraterone should be \noptimally sequenced. \n \nElderly \nOf the 3179 patients in the controlled clinical trials who received enzalutamide, 2518 patients (79%) \nwere 65 years and over and 1162 patients (37%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in \nsafety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. \n\nPaediatric population  \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nenzalutamide in all subsets of the paediatric population in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\nEnzalutamide is poorly water soluble. The solubility of enzalutamide is increased by caprylocaproyl \nmacrogolglycerides as emulsifier/surfactant. In preclinical studies, the absorption of enzalutamide was \nincreased when dissolved in caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have been evaluated in prostate cancer patients and in healthy \nmale subjects. The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is \n5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days), and steady state is achieved in approximately one month. With daily \noral administration, enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. Daily \nfluctuations in plasma concentrations are low (peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). Clearance of \nenzalutamide is primarily via hepatic metabolism, producing an active metabolite that is equally as \nactive as enzalutamide and circulates at approximately the same plasma concentration as enzalutamide.  \n\nAbsorption  \nOral absorption of film-coated enzalutamide tablets was evaluated in healthy male volunteers after a \nsingle 160 mg dose of Xtandi film-coated tablets, and pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation were \nused to predict the pharmacokinetic profile at steady state. Based on these predictions, as well as other \nsupportive data, the median time to reach maximum plasma enzalutamide concentrations (Cmax) is \n2 hours (range 0.5 to 6 hours), and the steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of enzalutamide and its \nactive metabolite are similar for the film-coated tablets and the Xtandi soft capsules formulation. \nFollowing oral administration of the soft capsule formulation (Xtandi 160 mg daily) in patients with \nmetastatic CRPC, the steady-state plasma mean Cmax values for enzalutamide and its active metabolite \nare 16.6 \u03bcg/mL (23% CV) and 12.7 \u03bcg/mL (30% CV), respectively. \n \nBased on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of enzalutamide is estimated to be at least \n84.2%. Enzalutamide is not a substrate of the efflux transporters P-gp or BCRP.  \n \nFood has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. In clinical trials, Xtandi was \nadministered without regard to food. \n\nDistribution  \nThe mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is \n110 L (29% CV). The volume of distribution of enzalutamide is greater than the volume of total body \nwater, indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. Studies in rodents indicate that enzalutamide \nand its active metabolite can cross the blood brain barrier. \n  \nEnzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. The active metabolite is \n95% bound to plasma proteins. There was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and \nother highly bound medicinal products (warfarin, ibuprofen and salicylic acid) in vitro. \n\nBiotransformation  \nEnzalutamide is extensively metabolised. There are two major metabolites in human plasma: \nN-desmethyl enzalutamide (active) and a carboxylic acid derivative (inactive). Enzalutamide is \nmetabolised by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4/5 (see section 4.5), both of which play a \nrole in the formation of the active metabolite. In vitro, N-desmethyl enzalutamide is metabolised to the \ncarboxylic acid metabolite by carboxylesterase 1, which also plays a minor role in the metabolism of \nenzalutamide to the carboxylic acid metabolite. N-desmethyl enzalutamide was not metabolised by \nCYPs in vitro. \n \nUnder conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4, a moderate inducer of \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and has no clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 (see section 4.5). \n\nElimination  \nThe mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of enzalutamide in patients ranges from 0.520 and 0.564 L/h. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 14C-enzalutamide, 84.6% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days \npost dose: 71.0% is recovered in urine (primarily as the inactive metabolite, with trace amounts of \nenzalutamide and the active metabolite), and 13.6% is recovered in faeces (0.39% of dose as \nunchanged enzalutamide). \n \nIn vitro data indicate that enzalutamide is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1; and \nN-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate for P-gp or BCRP. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nIn vitro data indicate that enzalutamide and its major metabolites do not inhibit the following \ntransporters at clinically relevant concentrations: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, or OAT1. \n\nLinearity  \nNo major deviations from dose proportionality are observed over the dose range 40 to 160 mg. The \nsteady-state Cmin values of enzalutamide and the active metabolite in individual patients remained \nconstant during more than one year of chronic therapy, demonstrating time-linear pharmacokinetics \nonce steady-state is achieved. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal renal impairment study for enzalutamide has been completed. Patients with serum \ncreatinine > 177 \u03bcmol/L (2 mg/dL) were excluded from clinical trials. Based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with calculated creatinine \nclearance (CrCL) values \u2265 30 mL/min (estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula). Enzalutamide \nhas not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) or end-stage \nrenal disease, and caution is advised when treating these patients. It is unlikely that enzalutamide will \nbe significantly removed by intermittent haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment did not have a pronounced effect on the total exposure to enzalutamide or its \nactive metabolite. The half-life of enzalutamide was however doubled in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment compared with healthy controls (10.4 days compared to 4.7 days), possibly related to an \nincreased tissue distribution. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were examined in subjects with baseline mild (N = 6), \nmoderate (N = 8) or severe (N = 8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B or C, respectively) and \nin 22 matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Following a single oral 160 mg dose of \nenzalutamide, the AUC and Cmax for enzalutamide in subjects with mild impairment increased by 5% \nand 24%, respectively, the AUC and Cmax of enzalutamide in subjects with moderate impairment \nincreased by 29% and decreased by 11%, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax of enzalutamide in \nsubjects with severe impairment increased by 5% and decreased by 41%, respectively, compared to \nhealthy control subjects. For the sum of unbound enzalutamide plus the unbound active metabolite, the \nAUC and Cmax in subjects with mild impairment increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, the AUC \nand Cmax in subjects with moderate impairment increased by 14% and decreased by 17%, respectively, \nand the AUC and Cmax in subjects with severe hepatic impairment increased by 34% and decreased by \n27%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. \n \nRace \nMost patients in the controlled clinical trials (> 74%) were Caucasian. Based on pharmacokinetic data \nfrom studies in Japanese and Chinese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically relevant \ndifferences in exposure among the populations. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races. \n \nElderly \nNo clinically relevant effect of age on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was seen in the elderly \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\nEnzalutamide treatment of pregnant mice resulted in an increased incidence of embryo-fetal deaths and \nexternal and skeletal changes. Reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with enzalutamide, \nbut in studies in rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13, and 39 weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, \nand hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the reproductive system were noted, consistent with the \npharmacological activity of enzalutamide. In studies in mice (4 weeks), rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs \n(4, 13, and 39 weeks), changes in the reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases \nin organ weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymis. Leydig cell hypertrophy and/or \nhyperplasia were observed in mice (4 weeks) and dogs (39 weeks). Additional changes to reproductive \n\n\n\n44 \n\ntissues included hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the pituitary gland and atrophy in seminal vesicles in rats \nand testicular hypospermia and seminiferous tubule degeneration in dogs. Gender differences were \nnoted in rat mammary glands (male atrophy and female lobular hyperplasia). Changes in the \nreproductive organs in both species were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide \nand reversed or partially resolved after an 8-week recovery period. There were no other important \nchanges in clinical pathology or histopathology in any other organ system, including the liver, in either \nspecies. \n \nStudies in pregnant rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to fetuses. \nAfter oral administration of radiolabeled 14C-enzalutamide to rats on day 14 of pregnancy at a dose of \n30 mg/kg (~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the \nfetus was reached 4 hours after administration and was lower than that in the maternal plasma with \ntissue/plasma ratio of 0.27. The radioactivity in the fetus decreased to 0.08 times the maximum \nconcentration at 72 hours after administration. \n \nStudies in lactating rats have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are secreted in rat milk. \nAfter oral administration of radiolabeled 14C-enzalutamide to lactating rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg \n(~ 1.9 times the maximum dose indicated in humans), the maximum radioactivity in the milk was \nreached 4 hours after administration and was up to 3.54-fold higher than that in the maternal plasma. \nStudy results also have shown that enzalutamide and/or its metabolites are transferred to infant rat \ntissues via milk and subsequently eliminated. \n \nEnzalutamide was negative for genotoxicity in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. In a 6-\nmonth study in transgenic rasH2 mice, enzalutamide did not show carcinogenic potential (absence of \nneoplastic findings) at doses up to 20 mg/kg per day (AUC24h ~317 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL), which resulted in plasma \nexposure levels similar to the clinical exposure (AUC24h 322 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL) in mCRPC patients receiving \n160 mg, daily.  \n \nDaily dosing of rats for two years with enzalutamide at 10\u2013100 mg/kg/day produced an increased \nincidence of several, mostly benign, tumour types. The most prominent of these were benign Leydig \ncell tumours, urothelium papilloma, and carcinoma of urinary bladder. Benign Leydig cell tumours are \nexpected based on the pharmacological properties of this antiandrogen drug and not considered \nrelevant to humans. Some urothelium papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder is expected in rats \nbased on the horizontal structure of the rat urinary bladder, which can encounter concentrated urine \nand prolonged irritation from calculi. In the study, calculi and crystals were observed in rat urinary \nbladders. However, no obvious mechanistic rationale to explain specifically this malignancy can be \nestablished, and taking into account that exposure levels, based on AUC, achieved in the study, for \nenzalutamide plus its metabolites, were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the \nrecommended dose of 160 mg/day, urinary bladder carcinogenicity potential of enzalutamide in \nhumans cannot be excluded. Other tumours, which are also potentially related to the primary \npharmacology include fibroadenoma of mammary glands and benign thymoma of thymus in males, \nbenign granulosa cell tumours of ovaries in females, and adenoma of pituitary pars distalis in both \nsexes. The exposure levels achieved in this study in male rats at Week 26 at 100 mg/kg per day for \nenzalutamide plus its active metabolites M1 and M2 (AUC24: enzalutamide ~457 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, M1 ~321 \n\u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, M2 ~35 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL) were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the \nrecommended dose (160 mg/day) of enzalutamide (AUC24: enzalutamide ~322 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, M1 ~193 \n\u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, M2 ~278 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL).  \n \nEnzalutamide was not phototoxic in vitro. \n \n\n6.

What Xtandi is and what it is used for \n\nXtandi contains the active substance enzalutamide. Xtandi is used to treat adult men with prostate \ncancer that no longer responds to androgen deprivation therapy. \n \nHow Xtandi works \nXtandi is a medicine that works by blocking the activity of hormones called androgens (such as \ntestosterone). By blocking androgens, enzalutamide stops prostate cancer cells from growing and \ndividing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xtandi  \n \nDo not take Xtandi: \n\n- If you are allergic to enzalutamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n- If you are pregnant or may become pregnant (see \u2018Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u2019) \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nSeizures \nSeizures were reported in 4 in every 1,000 people taking Xtandi, and fewer than one in every 1,000 \npeople taking placebo (see \u2018Other medicines and Xtandi\u2019 below and section 4 \u2018Possible side effects\u2019).  \n \nIf you are taking a medicine that can cause seizures or that can increase the susceptibility for having \nseizures (see \u2018Other medicines and Xtandi\u2019 below) \n \nIf you have a seizure during treatment: \nSee your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor may decide that you should stop taking Xtandi. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)  \nThere have been rare reports of PRES, a rare, reversible condition involving the brain, in patients \ntreated with Xtandi. If you have a seizure, worsening headache, confusion, blindness or other vision \nproblems, please contact your doctor as soon as possible. (See also section 4 \u2018Possible side effects\u2019).  \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Xtandi  \n\n- If you are taking any medicines to prevent blood clots (e.g. warfarin, acenocoumarol, \nclopidogrel) \n\n- If you use chemotherapy like docetaxel \n- If you have problems with your liver \n- If you have problems with your kidneys \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have any of the following:  \nAny heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being \ntreated with medicines for these conditions. The risk of heart rhythm problems may be increased when \nusing Xtandi. \n \nIf you are allergic to enzalutamide, this may result in a rash or swelling of the face, tongue, lip or \nthroat. If you are allergic to enzalutamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, do not take \nXtandi. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking this \nmedicine.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xtandi \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You need to \nknow the names of the medicines you take. Keep a list of them with you to show to your doctor when \nyou are prescribed a new medicine. You should not start or stop taking any medicine before you talk \nwith the doctor that prescribed Xtandi. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines.

The dose of Xtandi or any other \nmedicines that you are taking may need to be changed.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- Xtandi is not for use in women.

What Xtandi is and what it is used for \n \nXtandi contains the active substance enzalutamide. Xtandi is used to treat adult men with prostate \ncancer that no longer responds to androgen deprivation therapy. \n \nHow Xtandi works \nXtandi is a medicine that works by blocking the activity of hormones called androgens (such as \ntestosterone). By blocking androgens, enzalutamide stops prostate cancer cells from growing and \ndividing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xtandi  \n \nDo not take Xtandi: \n\n- If you are allergic to enzalutamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n- If you are pregnant or may become pregnant (see \u2018Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u2019) \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nSeizures \nSeizures were reported in 4 in every 1,000 people taking Xtandi, and fewer than one in every \n1,000 people taking placebo (see \u2018Other medicines and Xtandi\u2019 below and section 4 \u2018Possible side \neffects\u2019).  \n \nIf you are taking a medicine that can cause seizures or that can increase the susceptibility for having \nseizures (see \u2018Other medicines and Xtandi\u2019 below) \n \nIf you have a seizure during treatment: \nSee your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor may decide that you should stop taking Xtandi. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)  \nThere have been rare reports of PRES, a rare, reversible condition involving the brain, in patients \ntreated with Xtandi. If you have a seizure, worsening headache, confusion, blindness or other vision \nproblems, please contact your doctor as soon as possible. (See also section 4 \u2018Possible side effects\u2019).  \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Xtandi  \n\n- If you are taking any medicines to prevent blood clots (e.g. warfarin, acenocoumarol, \nclopidogrel) \n\n- If you use chemotherapy like docetaxel \n- If you have problems with your liver \n- If you have problems with your kidneys \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have any of the following:  \nAny heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being \ntreated with medicines for these conditions. The risk of heart rhythm problems may be increased when \nusing Xtandi. \n \nIf you are allergic to enzalutamide, this may result in a rash or swelling of the face, tongue, lip or \nthroat. If you are allergic to enzalutamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, do not take \nXtandi. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking this \nmedicine.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xtandi \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

them. seizures seizures were reported in 4 in every 1,000 people taking xtandi, and in fewer than one in every 1,000 people taking placebo. seizures are more likely if you take more than the recommended dose of this medicine, if you take certain other medicines, or if you are at higher than usual risk of seizure. if you have a seizure, see your doctor as soon as possible. your doctor may decide that you should stop taking xtandi. posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres) there have been rare reports of pres (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people), a rare, reversible condition involving the brain, in patients treated with xtandi. if you have a seizure, worsening headache, confusion, blindness or other vision problems, please contact your doctor as soon as possible. other possible side effects include: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) tiredness, broken bones, hot flushes, high blood pressure common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) headache, fall, feeling anxious, dry skin, itching, difficulty remembering, blockage of the arteries in the heart (ischemic heart disease), breast enlargement in men (gynaecomastia), symptom of restless legs syndrome
