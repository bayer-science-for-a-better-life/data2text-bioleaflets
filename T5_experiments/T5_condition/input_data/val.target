riprazo hct tablets contain two active substances , called aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide . both of these substances help to control high blood pressure ( hypertension ). aliskiren is a substance that belongs to a new group of medicines called renin inhibitors . these reduce the amount of angiotensin ii the body can make . angiotensin ii causes blood vessels to tighten , which makes blood pressure higher . lowering the amount of angiotensin ii allows the blood vessels to relax ; this lowers blood pressure . hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics . hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output , which also lowers blood pressure . high blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries . if this continues for a long time , it can damage the blood vessels of the brain , heart and kidneys , and may result in a stroke , heart failure , heart attack or kidney failure . lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of developing these disorders . riprazo hct is used to treat high blood pressure .

what gilenya is gilenya contains the active substance fingolimod . what gilenya is used for gilenya is used in adults and in children and adolescents ( 10 years of age and above ) to treat relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis ( ms ), more specifically in : - patients who have failed to respond despite treatment with an ms treatment . or - patients who have rapidly evolving severe ms . gilenya does not cure ms , but it helps to reduce the number of relapses and to slow down the progression of physical disabilities due to ms . what is multiple sclerosis ms is a long - term condition that affects the central nervous system ( cns ), comprised of the brain and spinal cord . in ms inflammation destroys the protective sheath ( called myelin ) around the nerves in the cns and stops the nerves from working properly . this is called demyelination . relapsing - remitting ms is characterised by repeated attacks ( relapses ) of nervous system symptoms that reflect inflammation within the cns . symptoms vary from patient to patient but typically involve walking difficulties , numbness , vision problems or disturbed balance . symptoms of a relapse may disappear completely when the relapse is over , but some problems may remain . how gilenya works gilenya helps to protect against attacks on the cns by the immune system by reducing the ability of some white blood cells ( lymphocytes ) to move freely within the body and by stopping them from reaching the brain and spinal cord . this limits nerve damage caused by ms . gilenya also reduces some of the immune reactions of your body .

trimoxazole , an antibiotic cladribine , used to treat hairy cell leukaemia tell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these . some medicines can make it more likely that you ' ll have side effects , or make side effects worse . these include : sodium valproate , to treat epilepsy interferon , to treat viral infections pyrimethamine , to treat malaria and other parasitic infections dapsone , to prevent pneumonia and treat skin infections fluconazole or flucytosine , to treat fungal infections such as candida pentamidine or atovaquone to treat parasitic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( often referred to as pcp ) amphotericin or co - trimoxazole , to treat fungal and bacterial infections probenecid , to treat gout and similar conditions , and given with some antibiotics to make them more effective methadone , used as a heroin substitute vincristine , vinblastine or doxorubicin , to treat cancer . tell your doctor if you are taking any of these . some medicines interact with combivir 33 these include : clarithromycin , an antibiotic if you are taking clarithromycin , take your dose at least 2 hours before or after you take your combivir . phenytoin , for treating epilepsy . tell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin . your doctor may need to monitor you while you are taking combivir . medicines ( usually liquids ) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols ( such as xylitol , mannitol , lactitol or maltitol ), if taken regularly . tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with any of these . pregnancy if you are pregnant , if you become pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits to you and your baby of taking combivir . combivir and similar medicines may cause side effects in unborn babies . if you have taken combivir during your pregnancy , your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child . in children whose mothers took nrtis during pregnancy , the benefit from the protection against hiv outweighed the risk of side effects . breast - feeding women who are hiv - positive must not breastfeed , because hiv infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk . a small amount of the ingredients in combivir can also pass into your breast -

during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose . this is partly linked to restored health and life style , and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves . your doctor will test for these changes . treatment with combivir often causes a loss of fat from legs , arms and face ( lipoatrophy ). this loss of body fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine . your doctor should monitor for signs of lipoatrophy . tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs , arms , and face . when these signs occur , combivir should be stopped and your hiv treatment changed . like all medicines , this medicine can cause side effects , but not everyone gets them . when you are being treated for hiv , it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of combivir or other medicines you are taking , or an effect of the hiv disease itself . so it is very important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health . as well as the side effects listed below for combivir , other conditions can develop during combination therapy for hiv . it is important to read the information later in this section under ' other possible side effects of combination therapy for hiv '. very common side effects these may affect more than than 1 in 10 people : 35 headache feeling sick ( nausea ). common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people : being sick ( vomiting ) diarrhoea stomach pains loss of appetite feeling dizzy tiredness , lack of energy fever ( high temperature ) general feeling of being unwell difficulty in sleeping ( insomnia ) muscle pain and discomfort joint pain cough irritated or runny nose skin rash hair loss ( alopecia ). common side effects that might show up in blood tests are : a low red blood cell count ( anaemia ) or low white blood cell count ( neutropenia or leucopenia ) an increase in the level of liver enzymes an increased amount in the blood of bilirubin ( a substance produced in the liver ) which may make your skin appear yellow . uncommon side effects these may affect up to 1 in 100 people : feeling breathless wind ( flatulence ) itching muscle weakness . an uncommon side effect that may show up in blood test is : a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting ( thrombocytopenia ) or in all kinds of blood cells ( pancytopenia ). rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 1000 people : serious allergic reaction causing swelling of the face , tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing liver disorders , such as jaundice , enlarged liver or fatty liver , inflammation ( hepatitis ) lactic acidosis ( excess lactic acid in the blood ;

your medicine is called valtropin . it is a human growth hormone , also called somatropin . it has the same structure as the growth hormone that the body produces in the pituitary glands ( glands located at the base of the brain ). growth hormone regulates the growth and development of cells . when it stimulates growth of cells in the long bones of the legs and spine , it causes an increase in height . valtropin is used - to treat children ( 2 to 11 years old ) and teenagers ( 12 to 18 years old ) who do not develop to their normal height because of poor bone growth caused by growth hormone deficiency ( relative lack of growth hormone ), turner syndrome , or ' chronic renal insufficiency ' ( a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose their ability to perform their normal functions , such as the removal of wastes and extra fluid from the body ). - to treat adults with severe growth hormone deficiency who already had growth hormone deficiency when they were children or who do not have enough growth hormone during their adult years for some other reason . in this leaflet the patient is addressed as ' you '. caregivers administering valtropin to their children should consider that ' you ' refers to the child .
do not use valtropin - if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to somatropin or any of the other ingredients of the powder or solvent of valtropin , e . g . metacresol ( see section 2 , ' take special care with valtropin occurrence of certain side effects ') - and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour . tumours must be inactive and you must have finished your anti - tumour treatment before you start your treatment with valtropin . - for growth promotion in children who have already stopped growing - if you have had a serious heart or abdominal operation - if you are being treated for more than one injury following a serious accident - if you have sudden serious breathing problems 21 take special care with valtropin examinations before starting treatment - a specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine you to decide if it is safe to use valtropin . - if you have had a brain tumour a specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine your pituitary function to decide if it is safe to use valtropin . - before children are treated for growth hormone deficiency due to kidney problems , the doctor should observe the child for one year before starting growth hormone treatment . - if adults have been treated with growth hormone during childhood , they should be re - evaluated for growth hormone deficiency before starting any further treatment with growth hormones . - patients with prader - willi syndrome should not be treated with valtropin unless they are also suffering from growth hormone failure . during or after serious illness - if you have had a brain tumour , you should be re - examined frequently to make sure that the tumour has not come back . - if you had cancer as a child . a higher risk for having a second tumour ( benign and malignant ) has been reported in patients that survived their cancer and were treated with somatropin . of these second tumours , in particular , brain tumours were the most common . - if children have had a kidney transplant , growth hormone treatment will be stopped . - if the child has turner syndrome , the child ' s doctor should carefully check for ear infections such as otitis media , because turner syndrome patients have an increased risk of ear or other hearing disorders . occurrence of certain side effects - if symptoms like headache ( severe and recurrent ), visual changes , nausea and / or vomiting occur , please ask your doctor for advice . - if you have injected valtropin by mistake into the muscle instead of under the skin , your blood sugar may become too low ( hypoglycaemia ). please contact your doctor for further advice . - if the child begins to limp under treatment with valtropin , please ask your doctor for advice . - if you are a child and you are treated with somatropin . you have an increased risk of developing an inflammation of your pancreas ( pancreatitis ) compared to adults treated with somatropin . although rare , pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin - treated children who develop abdominal pain . - too much growth hormone can cause greater than normal growth of ears , nose , lips , tongue and cheekbone ( acromegaly ), high blood sugar ( hyperglycaemia ) and presence of sugar in the urine ( glucosuria ). always use valtropin as recommended by your doctor . - if an allergic reaction to solvent occurs , the vials should be reconstituted with water for injections without preservative ( metacresol ) and used as a single use vial ( see section 5 ' how to store valtropin '). do not use the supplied solvent if you have a known allergy to metacresol preservative . monitoring during treatment by your doctor - valtropin may affect the way your body handles sugar from food and drink . your doctor may check the amount of sugar in your urine or blood . - valtropin can affect the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood , so you must have thyroid function tests from time to time . if the thyroid is not working properly , valtropin may not work as well as it should . using other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription . tell especially your doctor if you are taking -

your doctor has given you aranesp ( an anti - anaemic ) to treat your anaemia . anaemia is when your blood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue , weakness and shortness of breath . aranesp works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin . erythropoietin is produced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells . the active substance of aranesp is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene - technology in chinese hamster ovary cells ( cho - k1 ). if you have chronic renal failure aranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure ( kidney failure ) in adults and children . in kidney failure , the kidney does not produce enough of the natural hormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia . because it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells , it will be about four weeks before you notice any effect . your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of aranesp to treat your anaemia . if you are receiving chemotherapy aranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non - bone marrow cancers ( non - myeloid malignancies ) who are receiving chemotherapy . one of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood cells . towards the end of your chemotherapy course , particularly if you have had a lot of chemotherapy , your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic .

copalia hct tablets contain three substances called amlodipine , valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide . all of these substances help to control high blood pressure . amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called " calcium channel blockers ". amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall , which stops the blood vessels from tightening . valsartan belongs to a group of substances called " angiotensin - ii receptor antagonists ". angiotensin ii is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten , thus increasing the blood pressure . valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin ii . hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called " thiazide diuretics ". hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output , which also lowers blood pressure . as a result of all three mechanisms , the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered . copalia hct is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients whose blood pressure is already controlled while taking amlodipine , valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances .

trydonis is a medicine to help breathing that contains the three active substances : beclometasone dipropionate , formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium . beclometasone dipropionate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids which act to reduce the swelling and irritation in your lungs . formoterol and glycopyrronium are medicines called long - acting bronchodilators . they act in different ways to relax the muscles in your airways , helping to open the airways wider and allowing you to breathe more easily . regular treatment with these three active substances helps to relieve and prevent symptoms such as shortness of breath , wheezing and cough in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ). trydonis can reduce exacerbations ( flare - ups ) of copd symptoms . copd is a serious long - term disease in which the airways become blocked and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged , leading to difficulty breathing .
do not use trydonis : if you are allergic to beclometasone dipropionate , formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine ( listed in section 6 ). warnings and precautions : trydonis is used as a maintenance treatment for your copd . do not use this medicine to treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing . if your breathing gets worse : if you develop worsening shortness of breath or wheezing ( breathing with a whistling sound ), straight after inhaling your medicine , stop using trydonis inhaler and use your quick - acting " reliever " inhaler straightaway . you should contact your doctor straightaway . your doctor will assess your symptoms and if necessary may start you on a different treatment . see also section 4 , " possible side effects ". if your copd gets worse : if your symptoms get worse or are difficult to control ( e . g . if you are using a separate " reliever " inhaler more frequently ) or if your " reliever " inhaler does not improve your symptoms , see your doctor immediately . your copd may be getting worse and your doctor may need to prescribe different treatment . talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using trydonis : if you have any heart problems , such as angina ( heart pain , pain in the chest ), a recent heart attack ( myocardial infarction ), heart failure , narrowing of the arteries around your heart ( coronary heart disease ), disease of your heart valves or any other abnormalities of your heart or if you have a condition known as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( also known as hocm , a condition where the heart muscle is abnormal ). if you have disorders of your heart rhythm such as irregular heart rate , a fast pulse rate or palpitations or if you have been told that your heart trace ( ecg ) is abnormal . if you have narrowing of the arteries ( also known as arteriosclerosis ), if you have high blood pressure or if you have an aneurysm ( abnormal bulging of the blood vessel wall ). if you have an overactive thyroid gland . if you have low blood levels of potassium ( hypokalaemia ). the combination of trydonis with some other copd medicines or medicines such as diuretics ( medicines that make the body lose water , to treat heart disease or high blood pressure ), can cause a sharp fall in your blood level of potassium . therefore , your doctor may wish to measure the potassium levels in your blood from time to time . if you have any disease of your liver or kidneys . if you have diabetes . high doses of formoterol may increase your blood glucose and therefore you may need to have extra blood tests to check your blood sugar when you start using this medicine , and from time to time during treatment . if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland ( known as a phaeochromocytoma ). if you are due to have an anaesthetic . depending on the type of anaesthetic , it may be necessary to stop using trydonis at least 12 hours before the anaesthesia . if you are being , or have ever been , treated for tuberculosis ( tb ) or if you have a chest infection . if you have an eye problem called narrow -

blocker medicine ( used for treating certain heart problems such as angina or for reducing blood pressure ) unless your doctor has chosen a beta - blocker that does not affect your breathing . beta - blockers ( including beta - blocker eye - drops ) may reduce the effects of formoterol or make it not work at all . on the other hand , using other beta2 - agonist medicines ( which work in the same way as formoterol ) may increase the effects of formoterol . using trydonis together with : medicines for treating -
