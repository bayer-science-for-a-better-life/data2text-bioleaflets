NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZynrelef (60 mg + 1.8 mg) / 2.3 mL prolonged-release wound solution  \n \nZynrelef (200 mg + 6 mg) / 7 mL prolonged-release wound solution  \n \nZynrelef (400 mg + 12 mg) / 14 mL prolonged-release wound solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution contains 29.25 mg of bupivacaine and 0.88 mg of meloxicam. \n \nZynrelef prolonged-release solution is provided in the following doses: \n\u2022 60 mg/1.8 mg of bupivacaine/meloxicam. \n\u2022 200 mg/6 mg of bupivacaine/meloxicam. \n\u2022 400 mg/12 mg of bupivacaine/meloxicam. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release wound solution. \n \nClear, pale yellow to yellow, viscous liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZynrelef is indicated for treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical \nwounds in adults (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZynrelef should be administered in a setting where trained personnel and equipment are available to \ntreat patients promptly who show evidence of neurological or cardiac toxicity. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose depends upon the size of the surgical site and the volume required to coat the \naffected tissues within the surgical site that could result in pain generation. It should be ensured there \nis not an excess that could be expressed from the site during closure, especially for small confined \nsurgical spaces (see section 4.4). \n \nThe volume to be withdrawn accounts for the hold-up in the Luer lock applicator. Examples of the \nvolume to be withdrawn and dose available for administration are as follows  : \n\u2022 Bunionectomy \u2013 up to 2.3 mL (60 mg/1.8 mg) \n\u2022 Open inguinal herniorrhaphy \u2013 up to 10.5 mL (300 mg/9 mg) \n \nThe maximum total dose of Zynrelef to be applied must not exceed 400 mg/12 mg (about 14 mL). \n \nUse with other anaesthetics \n\n\n\n3 \n\nWhen using Zynrelef with other local anaesthetics, overall local anaesthetic exposure must be \nconsidered through 72 hours. In total, the maximum administered dose of bupivacaine must not exceed \n400 mg/day. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) \nElderly patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical condition. \nAs elderly patients may have decreased renal function, this should be considered when performing \ndose selection. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Zynrelef is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). The use of Zynrelef in patients with non-dialysed severe renal impairment is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3) and use in patients with dialysed severe renal impairment is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Zynrelef is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \nPatients should be monitored for signs of worsening liver function (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). The use \nof Zynrelef in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Zynrelef in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntralesional use. \n \nZynrelef is intended for application to the surgical site. \n \nZynrelef is intended for single-dose administration. \n \nZynrelef should only be prepared and administered with the sterile components provided in the \nprocedure pack (vented vial spike, syringe, Luer lock applicator). Full instructions for use are provided \nin the package leaflet for use by healthcare professionals. \n \nZynrelef should be applied into the surgical site following final irrigation and suction and prior to \nsuturing. If multiple tissue layers are involved, the solution should be applied after final irrigation and \nsuction of each layer before closing. \n \nZynrelef is not injected, it should be applied without a needle to the tissue layers below the skin \nincision. The solution should not be applied to the skin. A sufficient amount of solution should be \napplied to coat the tissues. \n \nWhen using monofilament sutures, 3 or more knots are recommended, as contact with Zynrelef may \ncause a single knot to loosen or untie. \n \nFor instructions on the preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any local amide-type anaesthetic or non-steroidal \n\nantiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Meloxicam must not be given to patients who have \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndeveloped signs of asthma, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, or urticaria following the \nadministration of acetyl salicylic acid or other NSAIDs. \n\n\u2022 Third trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\u2022 Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see section 4.4). \n\u2022 Severe heart failure (see section 4.4). \n\u2022 Severely impaired liver function (see section 4.4). \n\u2022 Non-dialysed severe renal failure (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy and safety have not been established in major surgeries including abdominal, vascular and \nthoracic surgeries (see section 5.1). It is recommended not to use this medicine in major surgeries. \n \nLocal anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) \n \nAs there is a potential risk of severe life-threatening adverse reactions associated with the \nadministration of bupivacaine, any bupivacaine-containing product should be administered in a setting \nwhere trained personnel and equipment are available to promptly treat patients who show evidence of \nneurological or cardiac toxicity. \n \nBupivacaine may cause acute toxicity effects on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems if \nutilised for local anaesthetic procedures resulting in high blood concentrations of the active substance. \nThis is especially the case after unintentional intravascular administration or injection into highly \nvascular areas. Ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, sudden cardiovascular collapse, and \ndeath have been reported in connection with high systemic concentrations of bupivacaine. The \nclinician responsible should take the necessary precautions to avoid local anaesthetic systemic toxicity \n(see section 4.2). \n \nPatients who require special attention in order to reduce the risk of dangerous adverse reactions \ninclude the following: \n\u2022 The elderly and patients in poor general condition should be given reduced doses commensurate \n\nwith their physical status. \n\u2022 Patients with partial or complete heart block \u2013 due to the fact that local anaesthetics may depress \n\nmyocardial conduction. \n\u2022 Patients with advanced liver disease or severe renal dysfunction. \n \nThe toxic effects of local anaesthetics are additive and their administration should be used with \ncaution, including monitoring for neurologic and cardiovascular effects related to LAST. \n \nCardiovascular system \n \nClinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses \nand in long term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events \n(for example myocardial infarction or stroke). There are insufficient data to exclude such a risk for \nZynrelef. The use of Zynrelef in patients with a recent myocardial infarction should be avoided unless \nthe benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent cardiovascular thrombotic events. \n \nPatients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, \nperipheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Zynrelef after \ncareful consideration. \n \nGastrointestinal system \n \nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ulceration, or perforation, which can be fatal, have been reported with \nall NSAIDs at any time during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of \nserious GI events. As Zynrelef contains meloxicam, an NSAID, health care professionals should \n\n\n\n5 \n\nremain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding. If a serious GI adverse reaction is \nsuspected, evaluation and treatment should be promptly initiated. \n \nThe risk of GI bleeding, ulceration, or perforation is higher with increasing NSAID doses in patients \nwith a history of ulcer and in the elderly. Combination therapy with protective medicinal products (e.g. \nmisoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients and for patients \nrequiring concomitant low-dose acetylsalicylic acid or other active substances likely to increase GI \nrisk (see below and section 4.5). \n \nPatients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly when elderly, should be advised to report any \nunusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding). \n \nCaution is advised in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products which could increase the risk \nof ulceration or bleeding, such as heparin, anticoagulants such as warfarin, or other NSAIDs, including \nacetylsalicylic acid given at anti-inflammatory doses (\u2265 1 g, as single intake, or \u2265 3 g, as total daily \namount) (see section 4.5). \n \nSerious skin reactions \n \nLife-threatening cutaneous reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n[TEN]) have been reported with the use of meloxicam. Patients should be advised of the signs and \nsymptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. The highest risk for occurrence of SJS or TEN is \nwithin the first weeks of treatment. If the patient has developed SJS or TEN with the use of \nmeloxicam, Zynrelef must not be administered in this patient at any time. \n \nMonitoring of liver and renal function \n \nOccasional increases in serum transaminase levels, increases in serum bilirubin or other liver function \nparameters, as well as increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, as well as other \nlaboratory disturbances, have been reported with meloxicam. The majority of these instances involved \ntransitory and slight abnormalities. Patients should be monitored for signs of worsening liver or renal \nfunction. \n \nRenal toxicity and renal impairment \n \nRenal toxicity has been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the \nmaintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-\ndependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may \nprecipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired \nrenal function, nephrotic syndrome, lupus nephropathy, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, \nsevere liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or \nangiotensin-II antagonists, and the elderly. \n \nRenal function should be monitored in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, \ndehydration, or hypovolemia after administration of Zynrelef. \n \nThe renal effects of meloxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with \npre-existing renal disease. \n \nNo information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients \nwith advanced renal disease. Because some meloxicam metabolites are excreted by the kidney, the use \nof Zynrelef is not recommended in patients with dialysed severe renal impairment unless the benefits \nare expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. Zynrelef is contraindicated in patients \nwith non-dialysed severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSince bupivacaine is metabolized by the liver, high doses should be used cautiously in patients with \nhepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local \nanaesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. The use of \nZynrelef in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nHyperkalaemia \n \nIncreases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalaemia, have been reported for \nmeloxicam in patients with diabetes or receiving concomitant treatment known to increase potassium \nconcentrations. Zynrelef should only be used in patients with hyperkalaemia if the benefits outweight \nthe risks. \n \nChondrolysis \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving postoperative \nintra-articular continuous infusion of local anaesthetics. The majority of reported cases of chondrolysis \nhave involved the shoulder joint. Due to multiple contributing factors and inconsistency in the \nscientific literature regarding mechanism of action, causality has not been established. Intra-articular \ncontinuous infusion of Zynrelef should be avoided. \n \nWound healing impairment \n \nImpaired wound healing has been observed in patients following bunionectomy (see section 4.8). For \nsmall, confined surgical spaces, avoid administration of excess volume (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBupivacaine \n \nBupivacaine should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anaesthetics or active \nsubstances structurally related to amide-type local anaesthetics, e.g. certain anti-arrhythmics, such as \nlidocaine and mexiletine, since the systemic toxic effects are additive (see section 4.4). \n \nMeloxicam \n \nACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin-II Antagonists \nNSAIDs may decrease the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, or \nbeta-blockers (including propranolol). \n \nIn patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal \nimpairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II antagonists may \nresult in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \nreversible. \n \nPatients on ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, or beta-blockers should be monitored following \ntreatment with Zynrelef to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. Patients who are elderly, \nvolume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, should be monitored for signs of worsening renal \nfunction (see section 4.4). \n \nDiuretics \nPatients on diuretics should be monitored following treatment with Zynrelef for signs of worsening \nrenal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy, including antihypertensive effects. \n \nLithium \nNSAIDs have been reported to increase blood lithium levels (via decreased renal excretion of lithium), \nwhich may reach toxic values. The concomitant use of lithium and NSAIDs is not recommended. If \n\n\n\n7 \n\nthe use of Zynrelef with lithium appears necessary, patients should be monitored for signs of lithium \ntoxicity following treatment with Zynrelef. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available human data on use of Zynrelef in pregnant women. \n \nBupivacaine \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of bupivacaine in pregnant women. Animal studies \nhave shown decreased pup survival and embryotoxic effects (see section 5.3). \n \nMeloxicam \nInhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may adversely affect the pregnancy and/or the embryo-foetal \ndevelopment. Data from epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of miscarriage and of \ncardiac malformation and gastroschisis after use of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor in early \npregnancy. The absolute risk for cardiovascular malformation was increased from less than 1%, up to \napproximately 1.5%. The risk is believed to increase with dose and duration of therapy. In animals, \nadministration of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor has been shown to result in increased pre- and \npost-implantation loss and embryo-foetal lethality. In addition, increased incidences of various \nmalformations, including cardiovascular, have been reported in animals given a prostaglandin \nsynthesis inhibitor during the organogenetic period. \n \nDuring the third trimester of pregnancy, all prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors may expose the foetus to \nthe following: \n\u2022 Cardiopulmonary toxicity (with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and pulmonary \n\nhypertension). \n\u2022 Renal dysfunction, which may progress to renal failure with oligohydroamnios. \n \nAt the end of pregnancy, all prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors may expose the mother and the neonate \nto the following: \n\u2022 Possible prolongation of bleeding time, an anti-aggregating effect, which may occur even at \n\nvery low doses. \n\u2022 Inhibition of uterine contractions resulting in delayed or prolonged labour. \n \nIf Zynrelef is used by a woman attempting to conceive, or during the first and second trimester of \npregnancy, the dose should be kept as low and duration of treatment as short as possible. \n \nDue to the meloxicam content, Zynrelef is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy (see \nsection 4.3). During the first and second trimester of pregnancy, meloxicam should not be given unless \nclearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no available human data on the use of Zynrelef in breast-feeding women. \n \nBupivacaine enters human milk and NSAIDs are also known to pass into human milk. A decision \nmust be made whether to start or discontinue breast-feeding taking into account the benefit of breast-\nfeeding for the child and the benefit of Zynrelef for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies evaluating the effects of Zynrelef on male and female fertility have not been performed. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe use of meloxicam may impair fertility in women attempting to conceive. In women who have \ndifficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility, Zynrelef should only be used \nif the benefits outweigh the risks. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBupivacaine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Zynrelef may have a very \nmild effect on mental function and coordination even in the absence of overt central nervous system \n(CNS) toxicity, and may temporarily impair locomotion and alertness. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction was dizziness (15.1%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions are based on experience from clinical trials and displayed by system \norgan class and frequency in Table 1 below. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. The frequency of the adverse reactions is expressed \naccording to the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10). \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported for Zynrelef \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Very Common Common \nNervous system disorders Dizziness Dysgeusia \nCardiac disorders  Bradycardia \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Skin odour abnormal \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\n \nCellulitis \nImpaired healing* \nLocal site reaction \nLocal site swelling \nLocal site erythema \nPeripheral swelling \n\n* Impaired wound healing, including wound dehiscence, has been observed in patients following bunionectomy \n(a model of surgery with a small, confined space available to instill the product). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nBupivacaine \n \nAccidental intravascular injections of bupivacaine may cause immediate (within seconds to a few \nminutes) systemic toxic reactions. In the event of overdose, systemic toxicity appears later \n(15-60 minutes after injection) due to the slower increase in local anaesthetic blood concentration. \n \nAcute systemic toxicity \nSystemic toxic reactions primarily involve the CNS and the cardiovascular system. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nCentral nervous system toxicity \nCNS toxicity is a graded response with symptoms and signs of escalating severity. The first symptoms \nare usually circumoral paraesthesia, numbness of the tongue, light-headedness, hyperacusis, tinnitus, \nand visual disturbances. Dysarthria, muscular twitching, or tremors are more serious and precede the \nonset of generalised convulsions. These signs must not be mistaken for neurotic behaviour. \nUnconsciousness and grand mal convulsions may follow, which may last from a few seconds to \nseveral minutes. Hypoxia and hypercarbia occur rapidly following convulsions due to the increased \nmuscular activity, together with the interference with respiration and possible loss of functional \nairways. In severe cases apnoea may occur. Acidosis, hyperkalaemia, and hypoxia increase and extend \nthe toxic effects of local anaesthetics. \n \nRecovery is due to redistribution of the local anaesthetic medicinal product from the central nervous \nsystem and subsequent metabolism and excretion. Recovery may be rapid unless large amounts of \nbupivacaine have been injected. \n \nCardiovascular system toxicity \nCardiovascular system toxicity may be seen in severe cases and is generally preceded by signs of \ntoxicity in the central nervous system. In patients under heavy sedation or receiving a general \nanaesthetic, prodromal CNS symptoms may be absent. Hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, and \neven cardiac arrest may occur as a result of high systemic concentrations of local anaesthetics, but in \nrare cases cardiac arrest has occurred without prodromal CNS effects. \n \nTreatment of acute toxicity \nIf signs of acute systemic toxicity appear, administration of Zynrelef should be immediately stopped. \n \nAt the first sign of toxicity, oxygen should be administered. \n \nThe first step in the management of convulsions, as well as under ventilation or apnoea, consists of \nimmediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with \noxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. \nImmediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should \nbe evaluated, keeping in mind that medicinal products used to treat convulsions sometimes depress the \ncirculation when administered intravenously. Should convulsions persist despite adequate respiratory \nsupport, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting \nbarbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be \nadministered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to the use of anaesthetics, with \nthese anticonvulsant medicinal products. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require \nadministration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor dictated by the clinical \nsituation (such as ephedrine to enhance myocardial contractile force). \n \nIf not treated immediately, both convulsions and cardiovascular depression can result in hypoxia, \nacidosis, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. If cardiac arrest should occur, standard \ncardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted. \n \nEndotracheal intubation, employing medicinal products, and techniques familiar to the clinician, may \nbe indicated after initial administration of oxygen by mask if difficulty is encountered in the \nmaintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated. \n \nMeloxicam \n \nThere is limited experience with meloxicam overdose. \n \nSymptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, \nvomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal \nbleeding can occur. Anaphylactoid reactions may occur following an overdose. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPatients should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an overdose of Zynrelef. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anesthetics, Local anaesthesia drugs (amides), ATC code: not yet \nassigned \n \nMechanism of action \n \nZynrelef is a fixed-dose, prolonged-release combination of bupivacaine and meloxicam. For \napproximately 72 hours after Zynrelef is applied into the surgical site, it releases bupivacaine and \nmeloxicam, which are then absorbed into the surrounding tissues. Meloxicam is believed to control the \ntissue inflammation thereby normalizing the pH and potentiating the effect of bupivacaine, resulting in \nan increase in analgesia. \n \nBupivacaine is a local anaesthetic of the amide type with both anaesthetic and analgesic effects. At \nhigh doses it produces surgical anaesthesia, while at lower doses it produces sensory block (analgesia) \nwith less pronounced motor block. \n \nMeloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam family, with \nanti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. Its precise mechanism of action remains \nunknown. Meloxicam inhibits the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, known inflammation mediators. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nBupivacaine \nBupivacaine causes a reversible blockade of impulse propagation along nerve fibres by preventing the \ninward movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane of the nerve fibres. The sodium channels \nof the nerve membrane are considered a receptor for local anaesthetic molecules. \n \nLocal anaesthetics may have similar effects on other excitable membranes, e.g. in the brain and \nmyocardium. If excessive amounts of active substance reach the systemic circulation, symptoms and \nsigns of toxicity may appear, emanating from the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. \n \nCentral nervous system toxicity (see section 4.9) usually precedes the cardiovascular effects as central \nnervous system toxicity occurs at lower plasma concentrations. Direct effects of local anaesthetics on \nthe heart include slow conduction, negative inotropism, and eventually cardiac arrest. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Zynrelef was evaluated in 2 multi-centre, double-blind, parallel-group, active- and \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials. \n \nStudy 301 (Bunionectomy) \nA total of 412 patients undergoing unilateral bunionectomy with osteotomy and fixation with a \nlidocaine Mayo block were randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups in a 3:3:2 ratio \n(respectively): Zynrelef 60 mg/1.8 mg, bupivacaine hydrochloride 50 mg, or saline placebo. The mean \npatient age was 47 years (range 18 to 77 years) and patients were predominantly female (86%). \nZynrelef was applied directly into the surgical site at the end of the procedure, after final irrigation and \nsuction, but prior to closure. Bupivacaine hydrochloride and saline placebo were administered by \ninjection and instillation, respectively. Pain intensity was rated by the patients on a 0 to 10 numeric \nrating scale (NRS) out to 72 hours post-dose. Postoperatively, there was no scheduled pain medication \nregimen; however, patients were allowed rescue medicinal products as needed (10 mg oxycodone \n\n\n\n11 \n\norally every 4 hours, 10 mg IV morphine every 2 hours, and/or 1,000 mg paracetamol orally every \n6 hours). \n \nResults for the primary endpoint and all 4 key secondary endpoints were positive. Zynrelef \nsignificantly reduced the mean AUC of the NRS-A pain intensity scores with activity through \n72 hours post-surgery compared with both saline placebo (primary endpoint) and bupivacaine HCl \n(Figure 1). Zynrelef also significantly reduced opioid consumption and significantly increased the \nproportion of subjects who required no postoperative opioid rescue medication (were \u201copioid-free\u201d) \n(Table 2). \n \nFigure 1: Mean pain intensity over 72 hours in Study 301 (bunionectomy) \n \n\n \n\n \nTable 2: Opioid-use over 72 hours in Study 301 (bunionectomy) \n \n\n \nZynrelef \n\n60 mg/1.8 mg \n(N = 157) \n\nBupivacaine \nHydrochloride \n\n50 mg \n(N = 155) \n\nSaline \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 100) \n\nTotal opioid \nconsumptiona \n0-72 hours \n\nMedian 13 18 25 \np-value vs saline placebo < 0.0001   \np-value vs bupivacaine \nhydrochloride 0.0022   \n\nOpioid-free \n0-72 hours \n\nn (%) 45 (29%) 17 (11%) 2 (2%) \np-value vs saline placebo < 0.0001   \np-value vs bupivacaine \nhydrochloride 0.0001   \n\na In intravenous morphine milligram equivalents (IV MME). \n \nStudy 302 (Inguinal herniorrhaphy) \nA total of 418 patients undergoing open inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh under general anaesthesia \nwere randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups in a 2:2:1 ratio (respectively): Zynrelef \n300 mg/9 mg, bupivacaine hydrochloride 75 mg, or saline placebo.

Zynrelef also significantly reduced opioid consumption and significantly increased the \nproportion of subjects who were \u201copioid-free\u201d (Table 3). \n \nFigure 2: Mean pain intensity (NRS) over 72 hours in Study 302 (herniorrhaphy) \n \n\n \n \n \n \nTable 3: Opioid-use over 72 hours in in Study 302 (herniorrhaphy) \n \n\n \nZynrelef \n\n300 mg/9 mg \n(N = 164) \n\nBupivacaine \nHydrochloride \n\n75 mg \n(N = 172) \n\nSaline \nPlacebo \n(N = 82) \n\nTotal opioid \nconsumptiona \n0-72 hours \n\nMedian 0 7 11 \np-value vs saline placebo 0.0001   \np-value vs bupivacaine \nhydrochloride 0.0240   \n\nOpioid-free \n0-72 hours \n\nn (%) 84 (51%) 69 (40%) 18 (22%) \np-value vs saline placebo < 0.0001   \np-value vs bupivacaine \nhydrochloride 0.0486   \n\na In intravenous morphine milligram equivalents (IV MME). \n \nSurgeries not evaluated with Zynrelef \nEfficacy and safety have not been established in major surgeries including abdominal, vascular and \nthoracic surgeries (see section 4.4). \n\nAUC0-72 \nZynrelef vs Placebo: p = 0.0004 \n\nZynrelef vs Bupivacaine HCl: p < 0.0001 \n\nZynrelef 300 mg/9 mg \n(N = 164) \n\nBupivacaine HCl 75 mg \n(N = 172) \n\nSaline Placebo \n(N = 82) \n\nHours Post Study Administration \n\nN\nR\n\nS \nPa\n\nin\n In\n\nte\nns\n\nity\n S\n\nco\nre\n\n (M\nea\n\nn \n\u00b1 \n\nSE\n) \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZynrelef in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute post-operative \npain (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nLocal application of Zynrelef into the surgical site results in detectable systemic plasma levels of \nbupivacaine through 72 hours and meloxicam through 120 hours. Systemic plasma levels of \nbupivacaine following application of Zynrelef are correlated with efficacy. \n \nAbsorption \n \nZynrelef is a prolonged-release formulation of bupivacaine and meloxicam using a polymer-based \ndrug delivery system. Following single-dose application of Zynrelef, bupivacaine and meloxicam are \nreleased simultaneously from the polymer for approximately 3 days. \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of bupivacaine and meloxicam from Zynrelef were evaluated following \nmultiple surgical procedures. \n \nDescriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters of representative Zynrelef doses in each study are \nprovided in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for bupivacaine and meloxicam after \nadministration of single doses of Zynrelef \n \n\nActive \nIngredient Parameter \n\nBunionectomy: \nZynrelef \n\n60 mg/1.8 mg \n(N = 17) \n\nHerniorrhaphy: \nZynrelef \n\n300 mg/9 mg \n(N = 16) \n\nBupivacaine \n\nCmax (ng/mL) 53.6 (32.6) 271 (147) \ntmax (h) 3.00 (1.55-24.08) 18.22 (3.10-30.28) \nAUC(0-t) (h\u00d7ng/mL) 1,650 (1,130) 14,900 (8,470) \nAUC(inf) (h\u00d7ng/mL) 1,680 (1,190) 15,300 (8,780) \n\nMeloxicam \n\nCmax (ng/mL) 25.6 (13.8) 225 (96.3) \ntmax (h) 18.02 (8.13-60) 53.72 (24.2-96.02) \nAUC(0-t) (h\u00d7ng/mL) 1,600 (915) 18,600 (7,860) \nAUC(inf) (h\u00d7ng/mL) 1,660 (1,050) 15,500 (NCa) \n\nAUC = area under the curve; NC = not calculated. \nNote: Arithmetic mean (standard deviation) except tmax where it is median (range). Doses of Zynrelef are shown \nas bupivacaine dose (mg)/meloxicam dose (mg).  \na Terminal elimination phase was not captured in a sufficient number of patients; SD was not calculated. \n \nDistribution \n \nAfter bupivacaine and meloxicam have been released from Zynrelef and are absorbed systemically, \nbupivacaine and meloxicam distribution is expected to be the same as for any bupivacaine \nhydrochloride solution or meloxicam oral formulation. \n \nBupivacaine \nBupivacaine has a total plasma clearance of 0.58 L/min, a volume of distribution at steady state of \n73 L and an intermediate hepatic extraction ratio of 0.38 after IV administration. It is mainly bound to \nalpha-l-acid glycoprotein with plasma binding of 96%. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nMeloxicam \nMeloxicam is very strongly bound to plasma proteins, essentially albumin (99%). Meloxicam \npenetrates into synovial fluid to give concentrations approximately half of those in plasma. Volume of \ndistribution is low, on average 11 L. Inter-individual variation is in the order of 30-40%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBupivacaine \nBupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominantly by aromatic hydroxylation to \n4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to pipecoloxylidide (PPX), both mediated by cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) 3A4. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine after administration \nof bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent medicinal product. The metabolites have a \npharmacological activity that is less than that of bupivacaine. \n \nMeloxicam \nMeloxicam undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation. Four different metabolites of meloxicam \nwere identified in urine, which are all pharmacodynamically inactive. The major metabolite, \n5'-carboxymeloxicam (60% of dose), is formed by oxidation of an intermediate metabolite \n5'-hydroxymethylmeloxicam, which is also excreted to a lesser extent (9% of dose). In vitro studies \nsuggest that CYP2C9 plays an important role in this metabolic pathway, with a minor contribution \nfrom the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The patient's peroxidase activity is probably responsible for the other \ntwo metabolites, which account for 16% and 4% of the administered dose respectively. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter bupivacaine and meloxicam have been released from Zynrelef and are absorbed systemically, \ntheir excretion is expected to be the same as for other bupivacaine hydrochloride solution formulations \nor meloxicam oral formulations. \n \nBupivacaine \nAbout 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 hours and approximately \n5% as PPX. The mean apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) for bupivacaine from Zynrelef is approximately \n14 to 15 hours. \n \nMeloxicam \nMeloxicam is excreted predominantly in the form of metabolites and occurs to equal extents in urine \nand faeces. Less than 5% of the daily dose is excreted unchanged in faeces, while only traces of the \nparent compound are excreted in urine. The mean apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) for meloxicam from \nZynrelef is approximately 22 to 25 hours. Total plasma clearance amounts on average 8 mL/min. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAfter bupivacaine and meloxicam have been released from Zynrelef and are absorbed systemically, \nthe effects of hepatic and renal impairment are expected to be the same as for other bupivacaine and \nmeloxicam formulations. \n \nHepatic/renal impairment \nClearance of bupivacaine is almost entirely due to liver metabolism and is more sensitive to changes in \nintrinsic hepatic enzyme function than to liver perfusion. \n \nNeither hepatic, nor mild nor moderate renal impairment, has a substantial effect on meloxicam \npharmacokinetics. In severe renal failure, the increase in the volume of distribution may result in \nhigher free meloxicam concentrations (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nElderly \n\n\n\n15 \n\nFollowing oral dosing of meloxicam, mean plasma clearance at steady state in elderly subjects was \nslightly lower than that reported for younger subjects. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data on Zynrelef, bupivacaine, or meloxicam reveal no special hazard for humans based \non conventional studies of general toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nNo evidence has been found of any mutagenic effect of meloxicam, either in vitro or in vivo. No \ncarcinogenic risk for meloxicam has been found in the rat and mouse at doses far higher than those \nused clinically. Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of \nZynrelef and bupivacaine have not been conducted. \n \nBupivacaine crosses the placenta. In reproduction toxicity studies, decreased survival of the offspring \nof rats and embryolethality was noted in rabbits at bupivacaine doses, which were 1.9- or 2.1-fold the \nmaximum recommended daily dose of Zynrelef in humans (based on body surface area using \nmaximum daily exposure in a 60 kg person). A study in rhesus monkeys of bupivacaine suggested \naltered postnatal behaviour following exposure to bupivacaine at birth. \n \nOral reproductive studies of meloxicam in the rat have shown a decrease of ovulations and inhibition \nof implantations and embryotoxic effects (increase of resorptions) at maternotoxic dose levels at \n1 mg/kg and higher. Studies of toxicity on reproduction in rats and rabbits did not reveal teratogenicity \nup to oral doses of 4 mg/kg in rats and 80 mg/kg in rabbits. These no observed effect levels exceeded \nthe maximum daily exposure of meloxicam in Zynrelef by a factor of 7.4- and 295-fold (based on \nbody surface area using maximum daily exposure in a 60 kg person). Foetotoxic effects at the end of \ngestation, shared by all prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, have been described. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zynrelef is and what it is used for \n \nZynrelef contains the medicines bupivacaine and meloxicam. \n\u2022 Bupivacaine belongs to a group of medicines called local anaesthetics. \n\u2022 Meloxicam belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n\n(NSAIDs). \n \nZynrelef will be applied during surgery by your doctor. \n \nZynrelef is used in adults to reduce pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds after surgery. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zynrelef \n \nYou must not be given Zynrelef: \n\u2022 if you are in your last trimester of pregnancy (30 weeks onwards). See section on pregnancy; \n\u2022 if you are allergic to bupivacaine and/or meloxicam or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6); \n\u2022 if you are allergic to other local anaesthetics of the same class as bupivicaine (such as \n\nlidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine); \n\u2022 if you have ever developed any of the following after taking acetyl salicylic acid, a \n\nsubstance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever, as well as to \nprevent blood clotting, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories : \n- wheezing, chest tightness, breathlessness (asthma) \n- nasal blockage due to swellings in the lining of your nose (nasal polyps) \n- skin rashes/nettle rash (urticaria) or serious skin reactions \n- sudden skin or mucosal swelling, such as swelling around the eyes, face, lips, mouth or \n\nthroat, possibly making breathing difficult (angioneurotic oedema) \n\u2022 during a heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft); \n\u2022 if you have severe heart failure; \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\u2022 if you have severe liver problems; \n\u2022 if you have severe kidney failure and not receiving dialysis. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before you are given \nZynrelef. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Zynrelef: \n\u2022 if you have heart problems, previous stroke or think that you might be at risk of these conditions \n\nbecause medicines such as meloxicam present in Zynrelef may be associated with a small \nincreased risk of heart attack (\u201cmyocardial infarction\u201d) or stroke. \n\n\u2022 if you have ever had bleeding from your stomach or gastro-intestinal tract, a stomach ulcer, or \ninflammation of the stomach (gastritis) because medicines such as meloxicam present in \nZynrelef may worsen these conditions. \n\n\u2022 if you develop signs of skin reactions, especially within the first weeks after surgery. Your \ndoctor will closely monitor skin reactions, and Zynrelef must never be administered to you \nagain. \n\n\u2022 if you have impaired kidney function or kidney disease. \n\u2022 if you have impaired liver function or liver disease. \n\u2022 if you have high potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalaemia). \n\u2022 if you are having a surgery to fix a bunion in your foot because impaired wound healing has \n\nbeen observed in patients following this surgery. Your doctor should be aware to avoid the \nadministration of an excess volume of Zynrelef. \n\n \nChondrolysis (breakdown of the cartilage) has been reported in patients receiving postoperative \nintra-articular continuous infusion of local anaesthetics (one of the ingredients of this medicine). Your \ndoctor should be aware that Zynrelef is not intended to be used for administration via an intra-articular \nroute. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are \ngiven Zynrelef. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nZynrelef is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Zynrelef \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is \nbecause Zynrelef can affect the way some medicines work. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking/have taken or are using any of the \nfollowing: \n\u2022 medicines used to treat an uneven heart beat (arrhythmia), such as lidocaine and mexiletine. \n \nYour doctor needs to know about these medicines to be able to work out the correct dose of Zynrelef \nfor you. \n \nAlso, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 medicines to treat heart and kidney diseases (such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor \n\nblockers, or beta-blockers); \n\u2022 any diuretic medicine (\u201cwater tablets\u201d). Your doctor may monitor your kidney function if you \n\nare taking diuretics; \n\u2022 lithium - used to treat mood disorders. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nIf you are in doubt about any of these medicines, ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are \nplanning to have a baby. Meloxicam, one of the medicines in Zynrelef, may make it more difficult to \nbecome pregnant. If you have difficulties conceiving or you are undergoing investigation for fertility, \nyour doctor will decide if Zynrelef should be given to you. \nZynrelef must not be administered during the last three months of pregnancy because Zynrelef \ncan have serious side effects on your unborn child, in particular heart, lung and kidney effects, \neven with only one administration. During the first 6 months of pregnancy, your doctor will decide \nif Zynrelef should be given to you. Zynrelef is not recommended during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nZynrelef may have a very mild effect on your mental function and coordination, and may temporarily \nimpair your locomotion and alertness. After you have been given Zynrelef, you should not drive or use \ntools or machines until after these effects wear off. \n \n \n3. How you will be given Zynrelef \n \nZynrelef will be applied during surgery by your doctor. \nYour doctor will determine the correct dose for you depending on the type of surgery you are having. \nYour doctor may decide to reduce the dose if you are elderly. \n \nYour doctor will ensure you have the correct amount of pain relief at all times. \n \nIf you have been given too much Zynrelef \n \nSerious side effects from getting too much Zynrelef need special treatment and the doctor treating you \nis trained to deal with these situations. \n \nSeek medical help as soon as possible if you experience any of these early signs of being given too \nmuch Zynrelef: \n\u2022 feeling dizzy or light-headed; \n\u2022 numbness of the lips and around the mouth; \n\u2022 numbness of the tongue; \n\u2022 hearing problems; \n\u2022 problems with your vision. \n \nMore serious side effects from being given too much Zynrelef include problems with your speech, \ntwitching of your muscles, tremors, trembling, fits (seizures), and loss of consciousness. If any of \nthese occur, seek medical help immediately. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nImportant side effects to look out for: \n \nSide effects reported in clinical studies for patients treated with Zynrelef were: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 dizziness \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 abnormally slow heart beat; \n\u2022 low blood pressure; \n\u2022 unpleasant body smell; \n\u2022 infection of the skin (cellulitis); \n\u2022 abnormal healing, including reopening of the wound, at the site of bunion surgery; \n\u2022 swelling, redness, heat or infection at the site of surgery; \n\u2022 swelling of your lower legs or hands; \n\u2022 altered taste. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.
