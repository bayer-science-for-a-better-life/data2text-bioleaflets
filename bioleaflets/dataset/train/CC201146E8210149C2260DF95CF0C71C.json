PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nWhite powder. \nThe solvent is a clear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents and children (2 \nyears old and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE). \n \nRoutine prevention of angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents and children (6 years old and above) \nwith severe and recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE), who are intolerant to or \ninsufficiently protected by oral prevention treatments, or patients who are inadequately managed with \nrepeated acute treatment. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCinryze therapy should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the care of \npatients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult \nTreatment of angioedema attacks \n\u2022 1000 IU of Cinryze at the first sign of the onset of an angioedema attack.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\u2022 A second dose of 1000 IU may be administered if the patient has not responded adequately after \n60 minutes. \n\n\u2022 For patients experiencing laryngeal attacks or if initiation of treatment is delayed, the second \ndose can be given sooner than 60 minutes. \n\n \nRoutine prevention of angioedema attacks \n\u2022 1000 IU of Cinryze every 3 or 4 days is the recommended starting dose for routine prevention \n\nagainst angioedema attacks; the dosing interval may need to be adjusted according to individual \nresponse. The continued need for regular prophylaxis with Cinryze should be reviewed on a \nregular basis. \n\n \nPre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks \n\u2022 1000 IU of Cinryze within 24 hours before a medical, dental, or surgical procedure. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAdolescents \nFor treatment, routine prevention and pre-procedure prevention in adolescents 12 to 17 years old, the \ndose is the same as for adults.  \n \nChildren  \nThe safety and efficacy of Cinryze in children less than 2 years old has not been established. Data \nsupporting dosing recommendations in children less than 6 years old are very limited. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. \n \n\nTreatment of angioedema attacks Pre-procedure prevention \nof angioedema attacks \n\nRoutine prevention of \nangioedema attacks \n\n2 to 11 years, >25 kg: \n1000 IU of Cinryze at the first sign of \nthe onset of an acute attack. \n \nA second dose of 1000 IU may be \nadministered if the patient has not \nresponded adequately after 60 minutes. \n \n2 to 11 years, 10-25 kg:  \n500 IU of Cinryze at the first sign of the \nonset of an acute attack. \n \nA second dose of 500 IU may be \nadministered if the patient has not \nresponded adequately after 60 minutes. \n \n\n2 to 11 years, >25 kg: \n1000 IU of Cinryze within \n24 hours before a \nmedical, dental, or \nsurgical procedure. \n \n \n \n2 to 11 years, 10-25 kg: \n500 IU of Cinryze within \n24 hours before a \nmedical, dental, or \nsurgical procedure. \n \n\n6 to 11 years: \n500 IU of Cinryze every 3 or \n4 days is the recommended \nstarting dose for routine \nprevention against \nangioedema attacks. The \ndosing interval and dose may \nneed to be adjusted according \nto individual response. The \ncontinued need for regular \nprophylaxis with Cinryze \nshould be reviewed on a \nregular basis. \n \n\n \nElderly patients  \nNo special investigations have been performed. For treatment, routine prevention and pre-procedure \nprevention in elderly patients, 65 years of age or older, the dose is the same as for adults. \n \nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \nNo special investigations have been performed. For treatment, routine prevention and pre-procedure \nprevention in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the dose is the same as for adults. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe reconstituted product should be administered by intravenous injection at a rate of 1 ml per minute.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThrombotic events \nThrombotic events have been reported in neonatal and infant subjects undergoing cardiac bypass \nprocedures while receiving off-label high doses of another C1 inhibitor product (up to 500 Units(\uf0de)/kg) \nto prevent capillary leak syndrome. Based upon an animal study there is a potential thrombogenic \nthreshold at doses greater than 200 Units(\uf0de)/kg. Patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events \n(including indwelling catheters) should be monitored closely. \n(\uf0de) [Historically assigned potency values were relative to an in-house reference  standard whereby 1 Unit (U) is \nequal to the mean quantity of C1 inhibitor present in 1 ml of normal human plasma.]  An international reference \nstandard (IU) has now been implemented where IU is also defined as the amount of C1 inhibitor present in 1 ml \nof normal human plasma. \n \nTransmissible agents  \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded.  \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and \nfor the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated \nreceipt of human plasma-derived C1 inhibitor product. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time Cinryze is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAs with any biological product hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Hypersensitivity reactions may \nhave symptoms similar to angioedema attacks. Patients should be informed of the early signs of \nhypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, \nhypotension and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur after administration, they should alert their \nphysician.  In case of anaphylactic reactions or shock, emergency medical treatment should be \nadministered.  \n \nHome-treatment and self-administration  \nThere are limited data on the use of this medicinal product in home- or self administration. Potential \nrisks associated with home-treatment are related to the administration itself as well as the handling of \nadverse reactions, particularly hypersensitivity. The decision on the use of home- treatment for an \nindividual patient should be made by the treating physician, who should ensure that appropriate \ntraining is provided and the use reviewed at intervals.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThrombotic events have been reported in neonatal and infant subjects undergoing cardiac bypass \nprocedures while receiving off-label high doses of another C1 inhibitor product (up to 500 Units(\uf0de)/kg) \nto prevent capillary leak syndrome.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSodium \nEach vial of Cinryze contains approximately 11.5 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet.   \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed.   \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of C1 inhibitor on \npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. To date, no other relevant epidemiological \ndata are available. No maternal or embryofoetal effects of treatment were observed in reproductive \nstudies in rats at dose levels up to 28-times the recommended human dose (1000 IU) based on an \naverage adult body weight of 70 kg. The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nTherefore, Cinryze should be given to pregnant women only if clearly indicated. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether C1 inhibitor is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot \nbe excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \nfrom Cinryze therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies on fertility, early embryonic and postnatal development, or carcinogenicity studies \nwere conducted (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased upon the clinical data currently available, Cinryze has minor influence on the ability to drive \nand use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe very common adverse reactions observed following Cinryze infusion in clinical studies were \nheadache and nausea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reaction frequencies were estimated from 2 pivotal placebo-controlled and 2 open-label \nstudies in 251 unique subjects. Only frequencies based on reporting rates from clinical trials are used \nto assign frequency category. \n \nAdverse reactions to treatment with Cinryze are classified by MedDRA System Organ Class and \nabsolute frequency in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies and in postmarketing reports \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nImmune system disorders Common Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Uncommon Hyperglycaemia \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common headache \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon Venous thrombosis, phlebitis, venous burning, hot flush \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders Uncommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nCommon vomiting \n\nUncommon Diarrhoea, abdominal pain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon Rash, erythema, pruritus \n\nUncommon Contact dermatitis,  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders Uncommon Joint swelling, arthralgia, myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Injection site rash/erythema, infusion site pain, pyrexia \n\nUncommon Chest discomfort,  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nAmong reports of venous thrombosis, the most common underlying risk factor was presence of an \nindwelling catheter. \n \nLocal reactions at the injection site were uncommon. In clinical studies local reactions (described as \npain, bruising, or rash at the injection/catheter site, venous burning or phlebitis) occurred in \nassociation with approximately 0.2% of infusions. \n \nPaediatric population \nAcross clinical studies, there were 61 unique paediatric subjects enrolled and exposed to over 2,500 \ninfusions of Cinryze (2-5 years, n=3; 6-11 years, n=32; 12-17 years, n=26). Among these children, the \nonly adverse reactions with Cinryze included headache, nausea, pyrexia, and infusion site erythema. \nNone of these adverse reactions were severe, and none led to discontinuation of medicinal product.  \n \nOverall, the safety and tolerability of Cinryze are similar in children, adolescents and adults.   \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported.   \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor, plasma derived, ATC \ncode: B06AC01. \n \nMechanism of action \nC1 inhibitor is a member of the serine protease inhibitor, or serpin, superfamily of proteins. The main \nfunction of serpins is to regulate the activity of serine proteases. C1 inhibitor is a single chain \nglycoprotein found in plasma which, in its mature state, consists of 478 amino acids with an apparent \nmolecular weight of 105 kD.   \n \nC1 inhibitor inhibits the complement system by binding C1r and C1s, two of the active enzyme \nsubunits of the first component of the complement system (C1) in the classical pathway, as well as to \nmannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases in the lectin pathway. The primary substrate of the \nactivated C1 enzyme is C4; uninhibited C1 results in diminished C4 levels. C1 is the most important \ninhibitor of contact activation and regulates the contact system and the intrinsic coagulation pathway \nby binding to and inactivating kallikrein and factor XIIa. Because these pathways are part of enzyme \namplification cascades, without C1 inhibitor, spontaneous or trigger-induced activation of these \npathways can lead to unopposed activation and swelling.   \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn clinical studies, the intravenous administration of Cinryze resulted in a significant increase in \nsystemic levels of antigenic and functional C1 inhibitor within 1 hour after administration. \nAdministration of C1 inhibitor increases serum levels of C1 inhibitor activity and temporarily restores \nthe natural regulation of the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems thereby controlling the \nswelling or the propensity to swell. \n \nLow serum C4 levels often correlate with HAE attacks. Treatment with Cinryze resulted in elevation \nof C4 levels at 12 hours. There was a statistically significant (p=0.0017) difference in the changes in \nmean values from baseline between treatment groups at 12 hours, demonstrating the association of \nCinryze treatment with an increase in C4 activity (Cinryze + 2.9 mg/dl versus placebo + 0.1 mg/dl). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nData from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (LEVP 2005-1/A and \nLEVP 2005-1/B), data from two open-label studies (LEVP 2006-1 and LEVP 2006-4) and 2 paediatric \nclinical studies (0624-203 and 0624-301) demonstrated the efficacy of Cinryze for the treatment and \nprevention of angioedema attacks in subjects with HAE.   \n \nCinryze for the treatment of HAE attacks \nStudy LEVP 2005-1/A used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design; 71 \nsubjects with acute HAE attacks were randomised (36 Cinryze, 35 placebo). The study demonstrated \nthat treatment with Cinryze within 4 hours after the onset of an HAE attack resulted in a greater than \n2-fold decrease in the time to beginning of unequivocal relief of the defining symptom of the HAE \nattack compared to placebo (median 2 hours for Cinryze vs. >4 hours for placebo, p=0.048). \nTreatment with Cinryze also resulted in a greater than 2-fold decrease in the time to complete \nresolution of the HAE attack compared to placebo (median 12.3 hours vs. 31.6 hours, p=0.001). The \npercentage of subjects with beginning of unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours \nafter dosing was 60% for Cinryze and 42% for placebo (p=0.062). Among 15 subjects treated with \nopen-label Cinryze for laryngeal HAE attacks, none required intubation.   \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nIn open-label study LEVP 2006-1, 101 subjects were treated for a total of 609 acute HAE attacks \n(median 3 attacks per subject; range: 1-57). Within 4 hours after Cinryze dosing, 87% of attacks \nachieved unequivocal relief of the defining symptom. For 95% of attacks, clinical relief was observed \nand/or subjects were discharged to home within 4 hours. For subjects with >1 attack, the proportion of \nattacks responding within 4 hours after Cinryze dosing and the time to response was comparable \nregardless of the number of attacks treated. Among 84 separate laryngeal HAE attacks, none required \nintubation following treatment with Cinryze. \n \nCinryze for the routine prevention of HAE attacks \nStudy LEVP 2005-1/B used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design; 22 \nsubjects were evaluable for efficacy (randomised and treated in both crossover periods). The study \ndemonstrated that prophylaxis with Cinryze resulted in a greater than 2-fold reduction in the number \nof HAE attacks compared to placebo (mean 6.3 attacks for Cinryze vs. 12.8 attacks for placebo, \np<0.0001). Angioedema attacks were also less severe during prophylactic Cinryze therapy compared \nto placebo (mean severity score 1.3 vs. 1.9 or a 32% reduction, p=0.0008) and of shorter duration \n(mean 2.1 days vs. 3.4 days or a 38% reduction, p=0.0004). The total number of days of swelling \nduring prophylactic Cinryze therapy was reduced compared to placebo (mean 10.1 days vs. 29.6 days \nor a 66% reduction, p<0.0001). In addition, fewer open-label Cinryze infusions were required for \ntreatment of HAE attacks during therapy with Cinryze compared to placebo (mean 4.7 infusions vs. \n15.4 infusions or 70% reduction, p<0.0001).   \n \nIn open-label study LEVP 2006-4, 146 subjects received Cinryze as HAE prophylaxis for periods \nranging from 8 days to approximately 32 months (median 8 months). Prior to enrollment, subjects \nreported a median monthly HAE attack rate of 3.0 (range: 0.08-28.0); during therapy with \nprophylactic Cinryze, this rate was 0.21 (range:  0-4.56), and 86% of subjects experienced an average \nof \u22641 attack per month. For subjects receiving Cinryze prophylaxis for at least 1 year, the monthly \nattack rate per subject remained consistently low (0.34 attacks per month) relative to pre-study rates. \n \nCinryze for the pre-procedure prevention of HAE attacks \nOpen-label Cinryze was administered within 24 hours prior to a total of 91 medical, dental, or surgical \nprocedures across the clinical programme (40 procedures in children and 51 procedures in adults).  For \n98% of procedures, no HAE attacks were reported within the 72 hours after the Cinryze dose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAge-Group 6-11 years: \nTreatment: \nStudy LEVP 2006-1: Twenty-two paediatric subjects were treated for 121 acute HAE attacks. The \nproportion of HAE attacks achieving unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours after \nCinryze treatment was comparable between the 22 children enrolled (age range: 2-17) and adults, with \n89% and 86% of attacks achieving relief, respectively.   \n \nStudy 0624-203: Nine subjects (age range: 6 - 11) were enrolled and received a single dose of \nCinryze: 3 subjects (10 - 25 kg) received 500 Units(\uf0de); 3 subjects (>25 kg) 1000 Units(\uf0de), and 3 \nsubjects (>25 kg) 1500 Units(\uf0de). All 9 (100%) subjects achieved unequivocal beginning of relief of the \ndefining symptom within 4 hours following initiation of treatment with Cinryze. Median interval was \n0.5 hours (range: 0.25-2.5 hours): 1.25, 0.25, and 0.5 hours in the 500 Units(\uf0de), 1000 Units(\uf0de), and \n1500 Units(\uf0de) Cinryze groups, respectively. Median interval to complete resolution of the HAE attack \nfor the 9 subjects was 13.6 hours (range:  1.6-102.3 hours).  \n \nPrevention: \nStudy LEVP 2006-4:  Prior to enrollment, 23 children (age range: 3 to 17 years) reported a median \nmonthly HAE attack rate of 3.0 (range: 0.5-28.0). During the study while receiving Cinryze \nprophylaxis (1000 Units(\uf0de) every 3 to 7 days; with the exception of a 3 year old child, receiving \n500 Units(\uf0de) every 3 to 7 days), children in the various age subgroups experienced median monthly \n\n\n\n9 \n\nHAE attack rates of 0.4 (range: 0-3.4), and 87% of children reported an average of \u22641 attack per \nmonth; these results were comparable to those observed in adults.  \n \nStudy 0624-301: Six pediatric subjects (6 to 11 years of age ) were enrolled and randomized to twice \nweekly dosing for 12 weeks in 2 treatment sequences (500/1000 Units(\uf0de) or 1000/500 Units(\uf0de) Cinryze. \nBoth doses resulted in similar reduction of attack-frequency and showed clinical benefit regarding \nseverity, duration, and requirement for acute treatment of attacks.  \n \nAge-group <6years:  \nFor the 3 subjects less than 6 years, administration of Cinryze (500 Units(\uf0de) or 1000 Units(\uf0de)) was \nassociated with increases in C1 INH levels and clinical efficacy in acute treatment and prevention of \nattacks. Overall administration of Cinryze was well tolerated.  \n \nIn all studies, administration of Cinryze resulted in increases in antigenic and functional C1 inhibitor \nlevels post-infusion compared to pre-infusion values in both children and adults.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nA randomised, parallel group, open-label pharmacokinetic study of Cinryze was performed in subjects \nwith non-symptomatic HAE. The subjects received either a single intravenous dose of 1000 Units(\uf0de) or \na 1000 Units(\uf0de) dose followed by a second dose of 1000 Units(\uf0de) 60 minutes later. The mean \npharmacokinetic parameters for functional C1 inhibitor derived from baseline-corrected concentration \ndata are presented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2.

The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) \nand area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) appeared to increase from the single to \ndouble dose, although the increase was not dose-proportional. The mean elimination half-life of \nfunctional C1 inhibitor after administration of Cinryze was 56 hours for a single dose and 62 hours for \nthe double dose.  \n \nBecause C1 inhibitor is an endogenous human plasma protein, it is not subject to metabolism by \nCytochrome P450 iso-enzymes, excretion, or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions exhibited by \nmany low molecular weight compounds. The expected consequence of metabolism of a glycoprotein \nis via degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. As such, the pharmacokinetics and \nexcretion of Cinryze are not expected to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPaediatric population \nFunctional C1 inhibitor activity was measured in children in the two open label studies (see section \n5.1). Mean increases from baseline in functional C1 inhibitor activity measured 1 hour post-dose in \nchildren 2 to <18 years of age ranged from 20% to 88% in Study LEVP 2006-1 (treatment) and from \n22% to 46% in Study LEVP 2006-4 (prevention) compared with 21% to 66% and 25% to 32% in \nadults, respectively. Two additional studies evaluated plasma levels in children (6-11 years).  \n \nIn study 624-203, plasma C1 INH antigen and functional activity from 9 patients were obtained \nfollowing a single IV dose of 500 Units(\uf0de), 1000 Units(\uf0de), or 1500 Units(\uf0de) Cinryze based on body \nweight (see section 5.1). Increases in C1 INH antigen levels and functional activity above the baseline \nvalues at 1 hour and 24 hours post-dose were demonstrated.  \n \nIn Study 0624-301, plasma C1 INH antigen and functional activity were measured from 6 patients pre-\ndose  and 1h following IV administration of two dose levels of Cinryze (500 Units(\uf0de) and 1000 \nUnits(\uf0de)) every 3 or 4 days for 12 weeks.  Both Cinryze doses resulted in relevant plasma levels of C1 \nINH antigen and functional activity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of general \ntoxicity and toxicity to reproduction. No genotoxicity studies were performed as the active substance \nis unlikely to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. No studies on fertility, early \nembryonic and post-natal development, or carcinogenicity studies were conducted because chronic \ndosing in animals would be expected to be associated with development of neutralising antibodies to \nthe human protein. \n \n \n6.

Store in the original package in order to protect from light.  \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \n500 IU of C1 inhibitor in a colourless glass vial (Type I), sealed with a rubber stopper (Type I) and an \naluminium seal with a plastic flip-off cap.   \n \n5 ml of water for injections in a colourless glass vial (Type I), closed with a rubber stopper (Type I) \nand an aluminium seal with a plastic flip-off cap. \n \nEach pack contains: \n \nTwo powder vials. \n \nTwo solvent vials. \n \n2 filter transfer devices, 2 disposable 10 ml syringes, 2 venipuncture sets, and 2 protective mats. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEach kit contains material for either one 1000 IU dose or two 500 IU doses. \n \nReconstitution and administration of Cinryze  \n \nReconstitution, product administration and handling of the administration set and needles must be \ndone with caution.  \n \nUse either the filter transfer device provided with Cinryze or a commercially available double-ended \nneedle.  \n \nPreparation and handling \nCinryze is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution with water for injections. \nCinryze vial is for single use only.    \n \nReconstitution \nOne powder vial, 1 solvent vial, 1 filter transfer device, 1 disposable 10 ml syringe, 1 venipuncture set \nand 1 protective mat is needed to prepare one dose of 500 IU.  \nTwo powder vials, 2 solvent vials, 2 filter transfer devices, 1 disposable 10 ml syringe, 1 venipuncture \nset and 1 protective mat is needed to prepare one dose of 1000 IU. \n \nEach product vial should be reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections. \nOne vial of reconstituted Cinryze corresponds to a dose of 500 IU.  \nTwo vials of reconstituted Cinryze correspond to a dose of 1000 IU.  Therefore two vials are \ncombined for one dose of 1000 IU. \n \n1. Work on the mat provided and wash your hands before performing the following procedures. \n2. Aseptic technique should be used during the reconstitution procedure. \n3. Ensure the powder vial and the solvent vial are at room temperature (15\u00baC - 25\u00baC).  \n4. Release the powder vial label by tearing down the perforated strip indicated by the inverted \n\ntriangle. \n5. Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials.  \n6. Cleanse stoppers with a disinfection swab and allow them to dry prior to use.  \n7. Remove protective covering from the top of the transfer device package. Do not remove the \n\ndevice from the package.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n8. Note: the transfer device must be attached to the solvent vial before being attached to the \npowder vial, so that the vacuum in the powder vial is not lost. Place the solvent vial on a flat \nsurface and insert the blue end of the transfer device into the solvent vial, pushing down until \nthe spike penetrates through the centre of the solvent vial stopper and the device snaps in place. \nThe transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure.      \n\n9. Remove the plastic package from the transfer device and discard it. Take care not to touch the \nexposed end of the transfer device.  \n\n10. Place the powder vial on a flat surface. Invert the transfer device and the solvent vial containing \nwater for injections and insert the clear end of the transfer device into the powder vial, pushing \ndown until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and the transfer device snaps into place. The \ntransfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure of the powder vial. The \nvacuum in the powder vial will draw in the solvent. If there is no vacuum in the vial, do not use \nthe product. \n\n11. Gently swirl the powder vial until all powder is dissolved. Do not shake the \npowder vial. Make sure all the powder is completely dissolved. \n\n12. Disconnect the solvent vial by turning it anti-clockwise. Do not remove the clear end of the \ntransfer device from the powder vial.   \n\n \nOne vial of reconstituted Cinryze contains 500 IU of C1 inhibitor in 5 ml, resulting in a concentration \nof 100 IU/ml. Proceed to administration process if patients receive a dose of 500 IU.  \n \nTwo vials of Cinryze powder must be reconstituted to make one dose (1000 IU/10 ml). Therefore, \nrepeat instructions 1 to 12 above using an additional package containing a transfer device to \nreconstitute the second of two powder vials. Do not reuse the transfer device. Once the two vials are \nreconstituted proceed to administration process for a dose of 1000 IU \n\n \nAdministration process for a dose of 500 IU  \n1. Aseptic technique should be used during the administration procedure. \n2. After reconstitution, the Cinryze solutions are colourless to slightly blue and clear. Do not use \n\nthe product if the solutions are turbid or discoloured. \n3. Using a sterile, disposable 10 ml syringe, draw back the plunger to allow approximately 5 ml of \n\nair into the syringe.  \n4. Attach the syringe onto the top of the clear end of the transfer device by turning it clockwise.  \n5. Invert the vial gently and inject air into the solution and then slowly withdraw the reconstituted \n\nCinryze solution into the syringe.   \n6. Detach the syringe from the vial by turning it anti-clockwise and releasing it from the clear end \n\nof the transfer device.  \n7. Inspect the reconstituted Cinryze solution for particulate matter prior to administration; do not \n\nuse if particles are observed. \n8. Attach the venipuncture set to the syringe containing Cinryze solution and inject intravenously \n\ninto the patient. Administer 500 IU (reconstituted in 5 ml of water for injections) of Cinryze by \nintravenous injection at a rate of 1 ml per minute over 5 minutes. \n\n \nAdministration process for a dose of 1000 IU \n1. Aseptic technique should be used during the administration procedure. \n2. After reconstitution, the Cinryze solutions are colourless to slightly blue and clear. Do not use \n\nthe product if the solutions are turbid or discoloured. \n3. Using a sterile, disposable 10 ml syringe, draw back the plunger to allow approximately 5 ml of \n\nair into the syringe.  \n4. Attach the syringe onto the top of the clear end of the transfer device by turning it clockwise.  \n5. Invert the vial gently and inject air into the solution and then slowly withdraw the reconstituted \n\nCinryze solution into the syringe.   \n6. Detach the syringe from the vial by turning it anti-clockwise and releasing it from the clear end \n\nof the transfer device.  \n7. Using the same syringe, repeat steps 3 to 6 with a second vial of reconstituted Cinryze to make \n\none complete 10 ml dose. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n8. Inspect the reconstituted Cinryze solution for particulate matter prior to administration; do not \nuse if particles are observed. \n\n9. Attach the venipuncture set to the syringe containing Cinryze solution and inject intravenously \ninto the patient. Administer 1000 IU (reconstituted in 10 ml of water for injections) of Cinryze \nby intravenous injection at a rate of 1 ml per minute over 10 minutes.  \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine. \n \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaftlet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What Cinryze is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Cinryze \n3. How to take Cinryze \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Cinryze \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cinryze is and what it is used for \n \nCinryze contains the human protein called \u201cC1 inhibitor\u201d as the active substance.   \n \nC1 inhibitor is a naturally occurring protein that is normally present in the blood. If you have a low \namount of C1 inhibitor in your blood or your C1 inhibitor is not working properly, this can lead to \nswelling attacks (called angioedema). Symptoms may include stomach pains and swelling of the:  \n\u2022 hands and feet \n\u2022 face, eyelids, lips or tongue \n\u2022 voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult \n\u2022 genitals \n \nIn adults and children, Cinryze can raise the amount of C1 inhibitor in the blood and either prevent \n(prior to undergoing medical or dental procedures) these swelling attacks from occurring or stop \nswelling attacks once they have begun. \nIn adults, adolescents and children (aged 6 years and above), Cinryze can raise the amount of C1 \ninhibitor in the blood and routinely prevent swelling attacks from occurring. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Cinryze \n \nDo not take Cinryze \n\u2022 If you are allergic to C1 inhibitor or any of the other ingredients of Cinryze (listed in section 6). \n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if you think you have ever had an allergic reaction to any of \nthe ingredients in Cinryze. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\u2022 Before you start treatment with Cinryze, it is important that you tell your doctor if you have, or \n\nhave had, problems with your blood clotting (thrombotic events). You will be carefully \nmonitored if this is the case. \n\n\u2022 If you begin to suffer from rashes, tightness of the chest, wheezing, or a fast heart beat once you \nhave taken Cinryze, you should tell your doctor immediately (see section 4). \n\n\u2022 When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to \nprevent infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and \nplasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of \neach donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products \nalso include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are \nadministered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also \napplies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and for the non-enveloped \nhepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses. \n \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider having vaccinations against hepatitis A and B if \nyou regularly or repeatedly receive C1 inhibitor products that have been taken from human \nplasma. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Cinryze the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded by your nurse or doctor in order to maintain a record for the \nbatches used.  \n\n \nChildren \n \nCinryze is not for use in children below 6 years of age for routine prevention of angioedema attacks. \n \nOther medicines and Cinryze \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.   \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking Cinryze. There is limited information on the safety of Cinryze use \nduring pregnancy and breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of \ntaking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nCinryze has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nCinryze contains sodium \n \nEach vial of Cinryze contains approximately 11.5 mg of sodium. This should be taken into account by \npeople on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to take Cinryze \n \nYour treatment will be initiated and managed under supervision of a doctor experienced in the care of \npatients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nA doctor or nurse may prepare and inject Cinryze for you. If your doctor decides you can self-\nadminister, your doctor or nurse will train you or a family member to prepare and inject Cinryze. Your \ndoctor will regularly review the preparation and administration process with you or a family member \nor carer. \n \nThe recommended dose of Cinryze for adults, adolescents, children, the elderly, or patients suffering \nfrom kidney or liver problems is as follows: \n \nAdults and adolescents (12 years and above) \n \nTreatment of swelling attacks \n\u2022 A dose of 1000 IU (two vials) of Cinryze should be injected at the first sign of a swelling attack.   \n\u2022 A second injection of 1000 IU may be given if your symptoms do not improve after 60 minutes. \n\u2022 If you are experiencing a severe attack, particularly a swelling of the voice-box (larynx), or if \n\ninitiation of treatment is delayed, the second 1000 IU dose may be given earlier than 60 minutes \nafter the first dose, depending on your clinical response. \n\n\u2022 Cinryze should be injected intravenously (into the vein). \n \nRoutine prevention of swelling attacks \n\u2022 A dose of 1000 IU (two vials) of Cinryze should be injected every 3 or 4 days for routine \n\nprevention of swelling attacks.  \n\u2022 The dosing interval may be adjusted by your doctor depending upon your response to Cinryze. \n\u2022 Cinryze should be injected intravenously (into the vein). \n \nPrevention of swelling attacks prior to surgery \n\u2022 A dose of 1000 IU (two vials) of Cinryze should be injected up to 24 hours before a medical, \n\ndental, or surgical procedure. \n\u2022 Cinryze should be injected intravenously (into the vein). \n \nChildren \n\nTreatment of angioedema attacks Pre-procedure prevention \nof angioedema attacks \n\nRoutine prevention of \nangioedema attacks \n\n2 to 11 years, >25 kg: \nA dose of 1000 IU (two vials) of \nCinryze should be injected at the first \nsign of a swelling attack. \n \nA second injection of 1000 IU may be \ngiven if your symptoms do not improve \nafter 60 minutes. \n \n2 to 11 years, 10-25 kg:  \nA dose of 500 IU (one vial) of Cinryze \nshould be injected at the first sign of a \nswelling attack. \n \nA second injection of 500 IU may be \ngiven if your symptoms do not improve \nafter 60 minutes. \n \n\n2 to 11 years, >25 kg: \nA dose of 1000 IU (two \nvials) of Cinryze should \nbe injected up to 24 hours \nbefore a medical, dental, \nor surgical procedure. \n \n \n \n2 to 11 years, 10-25 kg:  \nA dose of 500 IU (one \nvial) of Cinryze should be \ninjected up to 24 hours \nbefore a medical, dental, \nor surgical procedure. \n \n\n6 to 11 years: \nA dose of 500 IU (one vial) \nof Cinryze should be injected \nevery 3 or 4 days for routine \nprevention of swelling \nattacks. \n \nThe dosing interval may be \nadjusted by your doctor \ndepending upon your \nresponse to Cinryze. \n \n\n \nReconstitution and method of administration \n \nCinryze is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or your carer \nmight also administer Cinryze as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. If you are \ninjecting Cinryze yourself, always use it exactly as your doctor has instructed you. Check with your \n\n\n\n29 \n\ndoctor if you are not sure. If your doctor decides that you may be suitable for such home-treatment, \nhe/she will give you detailed instructions.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Cinryze contains \n \nThe active substance is C1 inhibitor produced from the plasma of human donors. Each powder vial \ncontains 500 IU of C1 inhibitor. After reconstitution, one vial contains 500 IU of C1 inhibitor (human) \nper 5 ml, corresponding to a concentration of 100 IU/ml. Two vials of reconstituted Cinryze contain \n1000 IU of C1 inhibitor (human) per 10 ml, corresponding to a concentration of 100 IU/ml.  \n \nThe total protein content of the reconstituted solution is 15 \u00b1 5 mg/ml. \n \nOne International Unit (IU) is equivalent to the amount of C1 inhibitor present in 1 ml of normal \nhuman plasma.  \n \nThe other ingredients (excipients) are:  \nPowder vial: sodium chloride, sucrose, sodium citrate, L-valine, L-alanine and L-threonine. See \nsection 2). \nSolvent vial: water for injections. \n \nWhat Cinryze looks like and contents of the pack \n \nCinryze is a white powder contained in a vial. \n \nAfter it has been dissolved in the water for injections the solution is clear and colourless to slightly \nblue. \n \nEach pack of Cinryze contains: \n2 vials of Cinryze 500 IU powder for solution for injection \n2 vials of water for injections (5 ml each) \n2 filter transfer devices \n2 disposable 10 ml syringes \n2 venipuncture sets \n2 protective mats \n \nOnly use a silicone-free syringe (provided in the pack) for administration of the product. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer: \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \nShire Services BVBA \nRue Montoyer 47 \nB - 1000 Brussels Belgium \nmedinfoeuceemea@shire.com \n \nManufacturer \nTakeda Manufacturing Austria AG \nIndustriestrasse 67 \n1221 Vienna \nAustria \n \nBaxter AG \nIndustriestrasse 67 \n1221 Vienna \nAustria \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nShire International Licensing B.V. \nStrawinskylaan 481 \n1077 XX Amsterdam \nThe Netherlands \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in . \n \nOther sources of information \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. \n\n\n\n32 \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nReconstitution and administration of Cinryze \n \nReconstitution, product administration and handling of the administration set and needles must be \ndone with caution.  \n \nUse either the filter transfer device provided with Cinryze or a commercially available double-ended \nneedle.  \n \nOnly use a silicone-free syringe (provided in the pack) for administration of the product. \n \nPreparation and handling \nCinryze is intended for intravenous administration (into the vein) after reconstitution with water for \ninjections. \nCinryze vial is for single use only.   \n \nReconstitution \nFor a dose of 500 IU: One powder vial, 1 solvent vial, 1 filter transfer device, 1 disposable 10 ml \nsyringe, 1 venipuncture set and 1 protective mat are needed. Store the remaining vial and \nadministration equipments for the next dose. \n \nFor a dose of 1000 IU: Two powder vials, 2 solvent vials, 2 filter transfer devices, 1 disposable 10 ml \nsyringe, 1 venipuncture set and 1 protective mat are needed. \n \nEach product vial should be reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections. \nOne vial of reconstituted Cinryze corresponds to a dose of 500 IU. Therefore only reconstitute one vial \nof Cinryze for one dose of 500 IU. \nTwo vials of reconstituted Cinryze correspond to a dose of 1000 IU.  Therefore two vials are \ncombined for one dose of 1000 IU. \n \n1. Work on the mat provided and wash your hands before performing the following procedures. \n2. Aseptic technique should be used during the reconstitution procedure. \n3. Ensure the powder vial and the solvent vial are at room temperature (15\u00baC - 25\u00baC).   \n4. Release the powder vial label by tearing down the perforated strip indicated by the inverted \n\ntriangle. \n5. Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials.  \n6. Cleanse stoppers with a disinfection swab and allow them to dry prior to use.  \n7. Remove protective covering from the top of the transfer device package. Do not remove the \n\ndevice from the package.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n8. Note: the transfer device must be attached to the solvent vial before being attached to the \npowder vial, so that the vacuum in the powder vial is not lost. Place the solvent vial on a flat \nsurface and insert the blue end of the transfer device into the solvent vial, pushing down until \nthe spike penetrates through the centre of the solvent vial stopper and the device snaps in place. \nThe transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure.      \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9. Remove the plastic package from the transfer device and discard it. Take care not to touch the \n\nexposed end of the transfer device.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10. Place the powder vial on a flat surface. Invert the transfer device and the solvent vial containing \n\nwater for injections and insert the clear end of the transfer device into the powder vial, pushing \ndown until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and the transfer device snaps into place. The \ntransfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure of the powder vial. The \nvacuum in the powder vial will draw in the solvent. If there is no vacuum in the vial, do not use \nthe product. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11. Gently swirl the powder vial until all powder is dissolved. Do not shake the \n\npowder vial. Make sure all the powder is completely dissolved. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n12. Disconnect the solvent vial by turning it anti-clockwise. Do not remove the clear end of the \ntransfer device from the powder vial.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nOne vial of reconstituted Cinryze contains 500 IU of C1 inhibitor in 5 ml, resulting in a concentration \nof 100 IU/ml. Proceed to administration process if patients receive a dose of 500 IU.  \n \nTwo vials of Cinryze powder must be reconstituted to make one dose (1000 IU/10 ml). Therefore \nrepeat instructions 1 to 12 above using an additional package containing a transfer device to \nreconstitute the second of two powder vials. Do not reuse the transfer device. Once the two vials are \nreconstituted proceed to administration process for a dose of 1000 IU. \n \nAdministration process for a dose of 500 IU  \n1. Aseptic technique should be used during the administration procedure. \n2. After reconstitution, the Cinryze solutions are colourless to slightly blue and clear.

should tell your doctor immediately (see section 4). when medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. these include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. the measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis b and hepatitis c viruses, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis a and parvovirus b19 viruses. your doctor may recommend that you consider having vaccinations against hepatitis a and b if you regularly or repeatedly receive c1 inhibitor products that have been taken from human plasma. it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of cinryze the name and batch number of the product are recorded by your nurse or doctor in order to maintain a record for the batches used. children

initiated and managed under supervision of a doctor experienced in the care of patients with hereditary angioedema (hae). a doctor or nurse may prepare and inject cinryze for you. if your doctor decides you can self- administer, your doctor or nurse will train you or a family member to prepare and inject cinryze. your doctor will regularly review the preparation and administration process with you or a family member or carer. the recommended dose of cinryze for adults, adolescents, children, the elderly, or patients suffering from kidney or liver problems is as follows: adults and adolescents (12 years and above) treatment of swelling attacks a dose of 1000 iu (two vials) of cinryze should be injected at the first sign of a swelling attack. a second injection of 1000 iu may be given if your symptoms do not improve after 60 minutes. if you are experiencing a severe attack, particularly a swelling of the voice-box (larynx), or if initiation of treatment is delayed, the second 1000 iu dose may be given earlier than 60 minutes after the first dose, depending on your clinical response. cinryze should be injected intravenously (into the vein). routine prevention of swelling attacks a dose of 1000 iu (two vials) of cinryze should be injected every 3 or 4 days for routine prevention of swelling attacks. the dosing interval may be adjusted by your doctor depending upon your response to cinryze. cinryze should be injected intravenously (into the vein). prevention of swelling attacks prior to surgery a dose of 1000 iu (two vials) of cinryze should be injected up to 24

reconstitution and method of administration cinryze is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. you or your carer might also administer cinryze as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. if you are injecting cinryze yourself, always use it exactly as your doctor has instructed you. check with your 29 doctor if you are not sure. if your doctor decides that you may be suitable for such home-treatment, he/she will give you detailed instructions. you will be required to keep a diary in order to document each treatment received at home and to bring it to each of your visits to the doctor. regular review of your/your carer's injection technique will be performed to ensure continued appropriate handling. if you have any further questions on the use
