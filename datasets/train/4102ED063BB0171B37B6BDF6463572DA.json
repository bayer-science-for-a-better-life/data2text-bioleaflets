NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBrilique 60 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 60 mg ticagrelor.\nBrilique contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nRound, biconvex, pink tablets marked with \u201860\u2019 above \u2018T\u2019 on one side and plain on the other.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBrilique, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \natherothrombotic events in adult patients with\n\n- acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or \n- a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic \n\nevent (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPatients taking Brilique should also take a daily low maintenance dose of ASA 75-150 mg, unless \nspecifically contraindicated.\n\nAcute coronary syndromes\nBrilique treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and \nthen continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Brilique 90 mg twice daily is recommended \nfor 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated (see section 5.1). \n\nHistory of myocardial infarction\nBrilique 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for \npatients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event (see \nsection 5.1). Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial \none-year treatment with Brilique 90 mg or other adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor \ntherapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be \ninitiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor \ninhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of \nextended treatment.\n\n\n\n3\n\nIf a switch is needed, the first dose of Brilique should be administered 24 hours following the last \ndose of the other antiplatelet medication.\n\nMissed dose\nLapses in therapy should also be avoided. A patient who misses a dose of Brilique should take only \none tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTicagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these \npatients is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). Only limited information is available in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor\nshould be used with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for patients \nwith mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in children below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \nFor oral use.\nBrilique can be administered with or without food.\nFor patients who are unable to swallow the tablet(s) whole, the tablets can be crushed to a fine \npowder and mixed in half a glass of water and drunk immediately. The glass should be rinsed with \na further half glass of water and the contents drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a \nnasogastric tube (CH8 or greater). It is important to flush the nasogastric tube through with water \nafter administration of the mixture.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\uf0b7 Active pathological bleeding.\n\uf0b7 History of intracranial haemorrhage (see section 4.8).\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\uf0b7 Co-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole,\n\nclarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and atazanavir), as co-administration may lead to a \nsubstantial increase in exposure to ticagrelor (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBleeding risk\nThe use of ticagrelor in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against \nthe benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). If \nclinically indicated, ticagrelor should be used with caution in the following patient groups:\n\n\n\n4\n\n\uf0b7 Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation \ndisorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). The use of ticagrelor is contraindicated \nin patients with active pathological bleeding, in those with a history of intracranial \nhaemorrhage, and in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\n\uf0b7 Patients with concomitant administration of medicinal products that may increase the risk of \nbleeding (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral anticoagulants and/or \nfibrinolytics) within 24 hours of ticagrelor dosing.\n\nPlatelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is \nunlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Since co-administration of ticagrelor\nwith desmopressin did not decrease template-bleeding time, desmopressin is unlikely to be \neffective in managing clinical bleeding events (see section 4.5).\n\nAntifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa \ntherapy may increase haemostasis. Ticagrelor may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been \nidentified and controlled.\n\nSurgery\nPatients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking ticagrelor before \nany surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken.\n\nIn PLATO patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ticagrelor had more \nbleeding than clopidogrel when stopped within 1 day prior to surgery but a similar rate of major \nbleeds compared to clopidogrel after stopping therapy 2 or more days before surgery (see \nsection 4.8). If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is not desired, \nticagrelor should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery (see section 5.1).\n\nPatients with prior ischaemic stroke\nACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with ticagrelor for up to 12 months \n(PLATO study).\n\nIn PEGASUS, patients with history of MI with prior ischaemic stroke were not included. \nTherefore, in the absence of data, treatment beyond one year is not recommended in these patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nUse of ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.3). There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, \ntherefore, caution is advised in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients at risk for bradycardic events\nHolter ECG monitoring has shown an increased frequency of mostly asymptomatic ventricular\npauses during treatment with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. Patients with an increased risk \nof bradycardic events (e.g. patients without a pacemaker who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd\n\ndegree AV block or bradycardic-related syncope) have been excluded from the main studies \nevaluating the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor. Therefore, due to the limited clinical experience, \nticagrelor should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.1).\n\nIn addition, caution should be exercised when administering ticagrelor concomitantly with \nmedicinal products known to induce bradycardia. However, no evidence of clinically significant \nadverse reactions was observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or \nmore medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium \nchannel blockers diltiazem and verapamil and 4% digoxin) (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n5\n\nDuring the Holter substudy in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses >3 seconds with \nticagrelor than with clopidogrel during the acute phase of their ACS. The increase in \nHolter-detected ventricular pauses with ticagrelor was higher in patients with chronic heart failure \n(CHF) than in the overall study population during the acute phase of ACS, but not at one month \nwith ticagrelor or compared to clopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated \nwith this imbalance (including syncope or pacemaker insertion) in this patient population (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nDyspnoea\nDyspnoea was reported in patients treated with ticagrelor. Dyspnoea is usually mild to moderate in \nintensity and often resolves without need for treatment discontinuation. Patients with \nasthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of \nexperiencing dyspnoea with ticagrelor. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with \nhistory of asthma and/or COPD. The mechanism has not been elucidated. If a patient reports new, \nprolonged or worsened dyspnoea this should be investigated fully and if not tolerated, treatment \nwith ticagrelor should be stopped. For further details see section 4.8.\n\nCreatinine elevations\nCreatinine levels may increase during treatment with ticagrelor. The mechanism has not been \nelucidated. Renal function should be checked according to routine medical practice. In patients \nwith ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the \ntreatment with ticagrelor, paying special attention to patients \u226575 years, patients with \nmoderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin\nreceptor blocker (ARB).\n\nUric acid increase\nHyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with ticagrelor (see section 4.8). Caution is advised in\npatients with history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. As a precautionary measure, the use of \nticagrelor in patients with uric acid nephropathy is discouraged.\n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely with the use of \nticagrelor. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia \nassociated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever. TTP is a potentially fatal \ncondition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis.\n\nInterference with platelet function tests to diagnose heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)\nIn the heparin induced platelet activation (HIPA) test used to diagnose HIT, anti-platelet factor \n4/heparin antibodies in patient serum activate platelets of healthy donors in the presence of \nheparin.\nFalse negative results in a platelet function test (to include, but may not be limited to the HIPA \ntest) for HIT have been reported in patients administered ticagrelor. This is related to inhibition of \nthe P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the patient\u2019s \nsera/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of \nHIT platelet function tests. \nIn patients who have developed HIT, the benefit-risk of continued treatment with ticagrelor should \nbe assessed, taking both the prothrombotic state of HIT and the increased risk of bleeding with \nconcomitant anticoagulant and ticagrelor treatment into consideration.\n\nOther\n\n\n\n6\n\nBased on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance ASA dose and relative efficacy \nof ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of ticagrelor and high maintenance dose \nASA (>300 mg) is not recommended (see section 5.1).\n\nPremature discontinuation\nPremature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Brilique, could result in an \nincreased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI or stroke due to the patient\u2019s underlying disease. \nTherefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTicagrelor is primarily a CYP3A4 substrate and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Ticagrelor is also a \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and a weak P-gp inhibitor and may increase the exposure of P-gp \nsubstrates.\n\nEffects of medicinal and other products on ticagrelor\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\n\uf0b7 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of ketoconazole with ticagrelor increased the \n\nticagrelor Cmax and AUC equal to 2.4-fold and 7.3-fold, respectively. The Cmax and AUC of \nthe active metabolite were reduced by 89% and 56%, respectively. Other strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and atazanavir) would be expected to have \nsimilar effects and therefore concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ticagrelor is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\n\uf0b7 Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of diltiazem with ticagrelor increased the \nticagrelor Cmax by 69% and AUC to 2.7-fold and decreased the active metabolite Cmax by \n38% and AUC was unchanged. There was no effect of ticagrelor on diltiazem plasma levels. \nOther moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, erythromycin and \nfluconazole) would be expected to have a similar effect and can as well be co-administered \nwith ticagrelor. \n\n\uf0b7 A 2-fold increase of ticagrelor exposure was observed after daily consumption of large \nquantities of grapefruit juice (3x200 ml). This magnitude of increased exposure is not \nexpected to be clinically relevant to most patients.\n\nCYP3A inducers\nCo-administration of rifampicin with ticagrelor decreased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC by 73% and \n86%, respectively. The Cmax of the active metabolite was unchanged and the AUC was decreased \nby 46%, respectively. Other CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) \nwould be expected to decrease the exposure to ticagrelor as well. Co-administration of ticagrelor\nwith potent CYP3A inducers may decrease exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor, therefore, their \nconcomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged.\n\nCyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor)\nCo-administration of cyclosporine (600 mg) with ticagrelor increased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC \nequal to 2.3-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. The AUC of the active metabolite was increased by \n32% and Cmax was decreased by 15% in the presence of cyclosporine. \n\nNo data are available on concomitant use of ticagrelor with other active substances that also are \npotent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may \nincrease ticagrelor exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be \nmade with caution.\n\n\n\n7\n\nOthers\nClinical pharmacology interaction studies showed that co-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, \nenoxaparin and ASA or desmopressin did not have any effect on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor \nor the active metabolite or on ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with ticagrelor alone. If \nclinically indicated, medicinal products that alter haemostasis should be used with caution in \ncombination with ticagrelor.\n\nA delayed and decreased exposure to oral P2Y12 inhibitors, including ticagrelor and its active \n\nmetabolite, has been observed in patients with ACS treated with morphine (35% reduction in \n\nticagrelor exposure). This interaction may be related to reduced gastrointestinal motility and apply \n\nto other opioids. The clinical relevance is unknown, but data indicate the potential for reduced \n\nticagrelor efficacy in patients co-administered ticagrelor and morphine. In patients with ACS, in \n\nwhom morphine cannot be withheld and fast P2Y12 inhibition is deemed crucial, the use of a \n\nparenteral P2Y12 inhibitor may be considered.\n\nEffects of ticagrelor on other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4\n\uf0b7 Simvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of ticagrelor with simvastatin increased simvastatin Cmax by \n\n81% and AUC by 56% and increased simvastatin acid Cmax by 64% and AUC by 52% with \nsome individual increases equal to 2- to 3-fold. Co-administration of ticagrelor with doses of \nsimvastatin exceeding 40 mg daily could cause adverse reactions of simvastatin and should \nbe weighed against potential benefits. There was no effect of simvastatin on ticagrelor \nplasma levels. Ticagrelor may have similar effect on lovastatin. The concomitant use of \nticagrelor with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended.\n\n\uf0b7 Atorvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of atorvastatin and ticagrelor increased atorvastatin acid \nCmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all \natorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant.\n\n\uf0b7 A similar effect on other statins metabolised by CYP3A4 cannot be excluded. Patients in \nPLATO receiving ticagrelor took a variety of statins, with no concern of an association with \nstatin safety among the 93% of the PLATO cohort taking these medicinal products. \n\nTicagrelor is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of ticagrelor and CYP3A4 substrates \nwith narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as ticagrelor \nmay increase the exposure to these medicinal products.\n\nP-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine) \nConcomitant administration of ticagrelor increased the digoxin Cmax by 75% and AUC by 28%. \nThe mean trough digoxin levels were increased about 30% with ticagrelor co-administration with \nsome individual maximum increases to 2-fold. In the presence of digoxin, the Cmax and AUC of \nticagrelor and its active metabolite were not affected. Therefore, appropriate clinical and/or \nlaboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent \nmedicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with ticagrelor.\n\nThere was no effect of ticagrelor on cyclosporine blood levels. Effect of ticagrelor on other P-gp \nsubstrates has not been studied.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of \neither medicinal product, which suggests that ticagrelor is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to \nalter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide.\n\n\n\n8\n\nOral contraceptives\nCo-administration of ticagrelor and levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol increased ethinyl estradiol \nexposure approximately 20% but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel. No \nclinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl \nestradiol are co-administered with ticagrelor.\n\nMedicinal products known to induce bradycardia\nDue to observations of mostly asymptomatic ventricular pauses and bradycardia, caution should be \nexercised when administering ticagrelor concomitantly with medicinal products known to induce \nbradycardia (see section 4.4). However, no evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions was \nobserved in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products \nknown to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and \nverapamil and 4% digoxin).\n\nOther concomitant therapy\nIn clinical studies, ticagrelor was commonly administered with ASA, proton pump inhibitors, \nstatins, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor \nblockers as needed for concomitant conditions for long-term and also heparin, low molecular \nweight heparin and intravenous GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors for short durations (see section 5.1). No \nevidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products was observed.\n\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin had no effect on \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated coagulation time (ACT) or factor Xa \nassays. However, due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with \nthe concomitant administration of ticagrelor with medicinal products known to alter haemostasis.\n\nDue to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and \ncitalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with ticagrelor as this may increase the \nrisk of bleeding.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid \npregnancy during ticagrelor therapy.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ticagrelor in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ticagrelor is not recommended during \npregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and \nits active metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A \ndecision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nticagrelor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nTicagrelor had no effect on male or female fertility in animals (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\n\n\n9\n\nTicagrelor has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. During treatment \nwith ticagrelor, dizziness and confusion have been reported. Therefore, patients who experience \nthese symptoms should be cautious while driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of ticagrelor has been evaluated in two large phase 3 outcome trials (PLATO and \nPEGASUS) including more than 39,000 patients (see section 5.1).\n\nIn PLATO, patients on ticagrelor had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events \nthan clopidogrel (7.4% vs. 5.4%). In PEGASUS, patients on ticagrelor had a higher incidence of \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events compared to ASA therapy alone (16.1% for ticagrelor 60 mg \nwith ASA vs. 8.5% for ASA therapy alone). The most commonly reported adverse reactions in \npatients treated with ticagrelor were bleeding and dyspnoea (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified following studies or have been reported in\npost-marketing experience with ticagrelor (Table 1). \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Within each SOC the \nadverse reactions are ranked by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined according to \nthe following conventions: Very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to \uf03c1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \uf03c1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Adverse reactions by frequency and system organ class (SOC)\n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps)\n\nTumour \nbleedingsa\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nBlood disorder \nbleedingsb\n\nThrombotic \nThrombocytopenic \nPurpurac\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity \nincluding \nangioedemac\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nHyperuricaemiad Gout/Gouty \n\nArthritis\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nConfusion\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nDizziness,\nSyncope, \nHeadache\n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage\n\n\n\n10\n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nEye disorders Eye \nhaemorrhagee\n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders\n\nVertigo Ear \nhaemorrhage\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nHypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea Respiratory \nsystem \nbleedingsf\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhageg, \nDiarrhoea, \nNausea, \nDyspepsia, \nConstipation\n\nRetroperitoneal \nhaemorrhage\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nSubcutaneous or \ndermal \nbleedingh, Rash, \nPruritus \n\nMusculoskeletal \nconnective tissue \nand bone\n\nMuscular \nbleedingsi\n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nUrinary tract \nbleedingj\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders\n\nReproductive \nsystem \nbleedingsk\n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine \nincreasedd\n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications\n\nPost procedural \nhaemorrhage, \nTraumatic \nbleedingsl\n\na e.g. bleeding from bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer\nb e.g. increased tendency to bruise, spontaneous haematoma, haemorrhagic diathesis\nc Identified in post-marketing experience\nd Frequencies derived from lab observations (Uric acid increases to >upper limit of normal from baseline below or within \nreference range.

However, \nmore PLATO combined Major + Minor bleeding occurred with ticagrelor compared with \nclopidogrel. Few patients in PLATO had fatal bleeds: 20 (0.2%) for ticagrelor and 23 (0.3%) for \nclopidogrel (see section 4.4).\n\nAge, sex, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy and medical \nhistory, including a previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, all did not predict either overall \nor non-procedural PLATO Major bleeding. Thus, no particular group was identified at risk for any \nsubset of bleeding.\n\nCABG-related bleeding:\nIn PLATO, 42% of the 1584 patients (12% of cohort) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft \n(CABG) surgery had a PLATO Major Fatal/Life-threatening bleeding with no difference between \ntreatment groups. Fatal CABG bleeding occurred in 6 patients in each treatment group (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nNon-CABG related bleeding and non-procedural related bleeding:\nTicagrelor and clopidogrel did not differ in non-CABG PLATO-defined Major Fatal/Life-\nthreatening bleeding, but PLATO-defined Total Major, TIMI Major, and TIMI Major + Minor \nbleeding were more common with ticagrelor. Similarly, when removing all procedure related \nbleeds, more bleeding occurred with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel (Table 2). Discontinuation of \n\n\n\n12\n\ntreatment due to non-procedural bleeding was more common for ticagrelor (2.9%) than for \nclopidogrel (1.2%; p<0.001).\n\nIntracranial bleeding:\nThere were more intracranial non-procedural bleeds with ticagrelor (n=27 bleeds in 26 patients, \n0.3%) than with clopidogrel (n=14 bleeds, 0.2%), of which 11 bleeds with ticagrelor and 1 with \nclopidogrel were fatal. There was no difference in overall fatal bleeds.\n\nBleeding findings in PEGASUS\nOverall outcome of bleeding events in the PEGASUS study are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Analysis of overall bleeding events, Kaplan-Meier estimates at 36 months \n(PEGASUS)\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice \n\ndaily + ASA\n\nN=6958\n\nASA alone\n\nN=6996\n\nSafety Endpoints KM%\n\nHazard \nRatio\n\n(95% CI)\n\nKM% p-value\n\nTIMI-defined bleeding categories\n\nTIMI    Major\n2.3 2.32\n\n(1.68, 3.21)\n\n1.1 <0.0001\n\nFatal\n0.3 1.00\n\n(0.44, 2.27)\n\n0.3 1.0000\n\nICH\n0.6 1.33\n\n(0.77, 2.31)\n\n0.5 0.3130\n\nOther TIMI Major\n1.6 3.61\n\n(2.31, 5.65)\n\n0.5 <0.0001\n\nTIMI Major or Minor\n3.4 2.54\n\n(1.93, 3.35)\n\n1.4 <0.0001\n\nTIMI Major or Minor or Requiring \n\nmedical attention\n\n16.6 2.64\n\n(2.35, 2.97)\n\n7.0 <0.0001\n\nPLATO-defined bleeding categories\n\nPLATO Major\n3.5 2.57\n\n(1.95, 3.37)\n\n1.4 <0.0001\n\nFatal/Life-threatening\n2.4 2.38\n\n(1.73, 3.26)\n\n1.1 <0.0001\n\nOther PLATO Major\n1.1 3.37\n\n(1.95, 5.83)\n\n0.3 <0.0001\n\nPLATO Major or Minor\n15.2 2.71\n\n(2.40, 3.08)\n\n6.2 <0.0001\n\nBleeding category definitions:\n\nTIMI Major: Fatal bleeding, OR any intracranial bleeding, OR clinically overt signs of haemorrhage associated with a \n\ndrop in haemoglobin (Hgb) of \u226550 g/L, or when Hgb is not available, a fall in haematocrit (Hct) of 15%.\n\nFatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days.\n\nICH: Intracranial haemorrhage.\n\nOther TIMI Major: Non-fatal non-ICH TIMI Major bleeding.\n\nTIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 30-50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin.\n\n\n\n13\n\nTIMI Requiring medical attention: Requiring intervention, OR leading to hospitalisation, OR prompting evaluation.\n\nPLATO Major Fatal/life-threatening: Fatal bleeding, OR any intracranial bleeding, OR intrapericardial with cardiac \n\ntamponade, OR with hypovolaemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors/inotropes or surgery OR clinically \n\napparent with >50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin or \u22654 red cell units transfused.\n\nPLATO Major Other: Significantly disabling, OR clinically apparent with 30-50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin, OR \n\n2-3 red cell units transfused.\n\nPLATO Minor: Requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding.\n\nIn PEGASUS, TIMI Major bleeding for ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was higher than for ASA \nalone. No increased bleeding risk was seen for fatal bleeding and only a minor increase was \nobserved in intracranial haemorrhages, as compared to ASA therapy alone. There were few fatal \nbleeding events in the study, 11 (0.3%) for ticagrelor 60 mg and 12 (0.3%) for ASA therapy alone. \nThe observed increased risk of TIMI Major bleeding with ticagrelor 60 mg was primarily due to a \nhigher frequency of Other TIMI Major bleedings driven by events in the gastrointestinal SOC.\n\nIncreased bleeding patterns similar to TIMI Major were seen for TIMI Major or Minor and \nPLATO Major and PLATO Major or Minor bleeding categories (see Table 3). Discontinuation of \ntreatment due to bleeding was more common with ticagrelor 60 mg compared to ASA therapy \nalone (6.2% and 1.5%, respectively). The majority of these bleedings were of less severity \n(classified as TIMI Requiring medical attention), e.g. epistaxis, bruising and haematomas.\n\nThe bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups \n(e.g. by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy \nand medical history) for TIMI Major, TIMI Major or Minor and PLATO Major bleeding events.\n\nIntracranial bleeding:\nSpontaneous ICHs were reported in similar rates for ticagrelor 60 mg and ASA therapy alone\n(n=13, 0.2% in both treatment groups). Traumatic and procedural ICHs showed a minor increase \nwith ticagrelor 60 mg treatment, (n=15, 0.2%) compared with ASA therapy alone (n=10, 0.1%). \nThere were 6 fatal ICHs with ticagrelor 60 mg and 5 fatal ICHs with ASA therapy alone. The \nincidence of intracranial bleeding was low in both treatment groups given the significant \ncomorbidity and CV risk factors of the population under study.\n\nDyspnoea\nDyspnoea, a sensation of breathlessness, is reported by patients treated with ticagrelor. In PLATO, \ndyspnoea adverse events (AEs) (dyspnoea, dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea exertional, dyspnoea \nparoxysmal nocturnal and nocturnal dyspnoea), when combined, was reported by 13.8% of patients \ntreated with ticagrelor and by 7.8% of patients treated with clopidogrel. In 2.2% of patients taking \nticagrelor and by 0.6% taking clopidogrel investigators considered the dyspnoea causally related to \ntreatment in the PLATO study and few were serious (0.14% ticagrelor; 0.02% clopidogrel), (see \nsection 4.4). Most reported symptoms of dyspnoea were mild to moderate in intensity, and most \nwere reported as a single episode early after starting treatment.\n\nCompared with clopidogrel, patients with asthma/COPD treated with ticagrelor may have an \nincreased risk of experiencing non-serious dyspnoea (3.29% ticagrelor versus 0.53% clopidogrel) \nand serious dyspnoea (0.38% ticagrelor versus 0.00% clopidogrel). In absolute terms, this risk was \nhigher than in the overall PLATO population. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients \nwith history of asthma and/or COPD (see section 4.4).\n\nAbout 30% of episodes resolved within 7 days. PLATO included patients with baseline congestive \nheart failure, COPD or asthma; these patients, and the elderly, were more likely to report dyspnoea.\nFor ticagrelor, 0.9% of patients discontinued study drug because of dyspnoea compared with \n\n\n\n14\n\n0.1% taking clopidogrel. The higher incidence of dyspnoea with ticagrelor is not associated with \nnew or worsening heart or lung disease (see section 4.4). Ticagrelor does not affect tests of \npulmonary function.\n\nIn PEGASUS, dyspnoea was reported in 14.2% of patients taking ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily and \nin 5.5% of patients taking ASA alone. As in PLATO, most reported dyspnoea was mild to \nmoderate in intensity (see section 4.4). Patients who reported dyspnoea tended to be older and \nmore frequently had dyspnoea, COPD or asthma at baseline.\n\nInvestigations\nUric acid elevations: In PLATO, serum uric acid increased to more than upper limit of normal in \n22% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 13% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The \ncorresponding numbers in PEGASUS were 9.1%, 8.8% and 5.5% for ticagrelor 90 mg, 60 mg and \nplacebo, respectively. Mean serum uric acid increased approximately 15% with ticagrelor \ncompared to approximately 7.5% with clopidogrel and after treatment was stopped, decreased to \napproximately 7% on ticagrelor but with no decrease observed for clopidogrel. In PEGASUS, a \nreversible increase in mean serum uric acid levels of 6.3% and 5.6% was found for ticagrelor \n90 mg and 60 mg, respectively, compared to a 1.5% decrease in the placebo group. In PLATO, the \nfrequency of gouty arthritis was 0.2% for ticagrelor vs. 0.1% for clopidogrel. The corresponding \nnumbers for gout/gouty arthritis in PEGASUS were 1.6%, 1.5% and 1.1% for ticagrelor 90 mg, \n60 mg and placebo, respectively.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nTicagrelor is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was \ndose-limiting in a single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions \nwhich may occur with overdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses (see section 4.8).\n\nIn the event of an overdose, the above potential adverse reactions could occur and ECG monitoring\nshould be considered.\n\nThere is currently no known antidote to reverse the effects of ticagrelor, and ticagrelor is not \ndialysable (see section 5.2). Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. \nThe expected effect of excessive ticagrelor dosing is prolonged duration of bleeding risk associated \nwith platelet inhibition. Platelet transfusion is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with \nbleeding (see section 4.4). If bleeding occurs other appropriate supportive measures should be \ntaken.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, ATC code: \nB01AC24\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nMechanism of action\nBrilique contains ticagrelor, a member of the chemical class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines \n(CPTP), which is an oral, direct acting, selective and reversibly binding P2Y12 receptor antagonist \nthat prevents ADP-mediated P2Y12 dependent platelet activation and aggregation. Ticagrelor does \nnot prevent ADP binding but when bound to the P2Y12 receptor prevents ADP-induced signal \ntransduction. Since platelets participate in the initiation and/or evolution of thrombotic \ncomplications of atherosclerotic disease, inhibition of platelet function has been shown to reduce \nthe risk of CV events such as death, MI or stroke.\n\nTicagrelor also increases local endogenous adenosine levels by inhibiting the equilibrative \nnucleoside transporter-1 (ENT-1). \n\nTicagrelor has been documented to augment the following adenosine-induced effects in healthy \nsubjects and in patients with ACS: vasodilation (measured by coronary blood flow increases in \nhealthy volunteers and ACS patients; headache), inhibition of platelet function (in human whole \nblood in vitro) and dyspnoea. However, a link between the observed increases in adenosine and \nclinical outcomes (e.g. morbidity-mortality) has not been clearly elucidated.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nOnset of action\nIn patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ASA, ticagrelor demonstrates a rapid \nonset of pharmacological effect as demonstrated by a mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) \nfor ticagrelor at 0.5 hours after 180 mg loading dose of about 41%, with the maximum IPA effect \nof 89% by 2-4 hours post dose, and maintained between 2-8 hours. 90% of patients had final extent \nIPA>70% by 2 hours post dose.\n\nOffset of action\nIf a CABG procedure is planned, ticagrelor bleeding risk is increased compared to clopidogrel \nwhen discontinued within less than 96 hours prior to procedure.\n\nSwitching data\nSwitching from clopidogrel 75 mg to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily results in an absolute IPA \nincrease of 26.4% and switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel results in an absolute IPA decrease \nof 24.5%. Patients can be switched from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without any interruption of \nantiplatelet effect (see section 4.2).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor is derived from two phase 3 trials:\n\n\uf0b7 The PLATO [PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes] study, a comparison of ticagrelor\nto clopidogrel, both given in combination with ASA and other standard therapy.\n\n\uf0b7 The PEGASUS TIMI-54 [PrEvention with TicaGrelor of SecondAry Thrombotic Events in \nHigh-RiSk AcUte Coronary Syndrome Patients] study, a comparison of ticagrelor combined \nwith ASA to ASA therapy alone.\n\nPLATO study (Acute Coronary Syndromes)\n\nThe PLATO study included 18,624 patients who presented within 24 hours of onset of symptoms \nof unstable angina (UA), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST elevation \nmyocardial infarction (STEMI), and were initially managed medically, or with percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI), or with CABG.\n\n\n\n16\n\nClinical efficacy\nOn a background of daily ASA, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily showed superiority to 75 mg daily \nclopidogrel in preventing the composite endpoint of CV death, MI or stroke, with the difference \ndriven by CV death and MI. Patients received a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg \npossible if having PCI) or 180 mg of ticagrelor.\n\nThe result appeared early (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0.6% and relative risk reduction [RRR] \nof 12% at 30 days), with a constant treatment effect over the entire 12-month period, yielding ARR \n1.9% per year with RRR of 16%. This suggests it is appropriate to treat patients with ticagrelor 90 \nmg twice daily for 12 months (see section 4.2). Treating 54 ACS patients with ticagrelor instead of \nclopidogrel will prevent 1 atherothrombotic event; treating 91 will prevent 1 CV death (see \nFigure 1 and Table 4).\n\nThe treatment effect of ticagrelor over clopidogrel appears consistent across many subgroups, \nincluding weight; sex; medical history of diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attack or \nnon-haemorrhagic stroke, or revascularisation; concomitant therapies including heparins, \nGpIIb/IIIa inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors (see section 4.5); final index event diagnosis \n(STEMI, NSTEMI or UA); and treatment pathway intended at randomisation (invasive or \nmedical).\n\nA weakly significant treatment interaction was observed with region whereby the hazard ratio \n(HR) for the primary endpoint favours ticagrelor in the rest of world but favours clopidogrel in \nNorth America, which represented approximately 10% of the overall population studied \n(interaction p-value=0.045). Exploratory analyses suggest a possible association with ASA dose \nsuch that reduced efficacy was observed with ticagrelor with increasing ASA doses. Chronic daily \nASA doses to accompany ticagrelor should be 75-150 mg (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nFigure 1 shows the estimate of the risk to the first occurrence of any event in the composite \nefficacy endpoint.\n\n\n\n17\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Analysis of primary clinical composite endpoint of CV death, MI and stroke\n(PLATO)\n\nTicagrelor reduced the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint compared to clopidogrel in \nboth the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI population (Table 4). Thus, Brilique 90 mg twice daily together \nwith low-dose ASA can be used in patients with ACS (unstable angina, non-ST elevation \nMyocardial Infarction [NSTEMI] or ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]); including \npatients managed medically, and those who are managed with percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG).\n\nTable 4 - Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PLATO)\n\nTicagrelor \n90 mg\n\ntwice daily\n(% patients \nwith event)\n\nN=9333\n\nClopidogrel \n75 mg \n\nonce daily\n(% patients \nwith event)\n\nN=9291\n\nARRa\n\n(%/yr)\nRRRa (%)\n(95% CI)\n\np-value\n\nCV death, MI (excl. \nsilent MI) or stroke\n\n9.3 10.9 1.9 16 (8, 23) 0.0003\n\nInvasive intent 8.5 10.0 1.7 16 (6, 25) 0.0025\n\nMedical intent 11.3 13.2 2.3 15 (0.3, 27) 0.0444d\n\nCV death 3.8 4.8 1.1 21 (9, 31) 0.0013\n\nMI (excl. silent MI)b 5.4 6.4 1.1 16 (5, 25) 0.0045\n\nStroke 1.3 1.1 -0.2 -17 (-52, 9) 0.2249\n\nAll-cause mortality, \nMI (excl. silent MI) \nor stroke\n\n9.7 11.5 2.1 16 (8, 23) 0.0001\n\n\n\n18\n\nCV death, total MI,\nstroke, SRI, RI, TIA \nor other ATEc\n\n13.8 15.7 2.1 12 (5, 19) 0.0006\n\nAll-cause mortality 4.3 5.4 1.4 22 (11, 31) 0.0003d\n\nDefinite stent \nthrombosis\n\n1.2 1.7 0.6 32 (8, 49) 0.0123d\n\na ARR = absolute risk reduction; RRR = relative risk reduction = (1-Hazard ratio) x 100%.

The superiority of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in reducing \nmajor CV events was not significantly affected by patient CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Similar \nto the overall PLATO study, total PLATO Major bleeding did not differ between ticagrelor and \nclopidogrel, regardless of CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Non-CABG PLATO Major bleeding \nwas increased with ticagrelor compared clopidogrel in patients with one or more CYP2C19 loss of \nfunction alleles, but similar to clopidogrel in patients with no loss of function allele.\n\nCombined efficacy and safety composite\nA combined efficacy and safety composite (CV death, MI, stroke or PLATO-defined \u2018Total Major\u2019 \nbleeding) indicates that the benefit in efficacy of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel is not offset by \nthe major bleeding events (ARR 1.4%, RRR 8%, HR 0.92; p=0.0257) over 12 months after ACS.\n\nClinical safety\n\nHolter substudy:\nTo study the occurrence of ventricular pauses and other arrhythmic episodes during PLATO, \ninvestigators performed Holter monitoring in a subset of nearly 3000 patients, of whom \napproximately 2000 had recordings both in the acute phase of their ACS and after one month. The \nprimary variable of interest was the occurrence of ventricular pauses \u22653 seconds. More patients had \nventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; and \n2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month (see section 4.4). The increase in ventricular pauses in \nthe acute phase of ACS was more pronounced in ticagrelor patients with history of CHF (9.2% \nversus 5.4% in patients without CHF history; for clopidogrel patients, 4.0% in those with versus \n3.6% in those without CHF history). This imbalance did not occur at one month: 2.0% versus 2.1% \nfor ticagrelor patients with and without CHF history, respectively; and 3.8% versus 1.4% with \nclopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated with this imbalance \n(including pacemaker insertions) in this population of patients.\n\nPEGASUS study (History of Myocardial Infarction)\n\nThe PEGASUS TIMI-54 study was a 21,162 patient, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, parallel group, international multicentre study to assess the prevention of \natherothrombotic events with ticagrelor given at 2 doses (either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice \ndaily) combined with low dose ASA (75-150 mg), compared to ASA therapy alone in patients with \nhistory of MI and additional risk factors for atherothrombosis.\n\nPatients were eligible to participate if they were aged 50 years or over, with a history of MI (1 to \n3 years prior to randomisation), and had at least one of the following risk factors for \n\n\n\n19\n\natherothrombosis: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, a second prior MI, \nevidence of multivessel CAD or chronic non-end-stage renal dysfunction.\n\nPatients were ineligible if there was planned use of a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, dipyridamole, \ncilostazol, or anticoagulant therapy during the study period; if they had a bleeding disorder or a \nhistory of an ischaemic stroke or intracranial bleeding, a central nervous system tumour or an \nintracranial vascular abnormality; if they had had gastrointestinal bleeding within the previous \n6 months or major surgery within the previous 30 days.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nFigure 2 - Analysis of primary clinical composite endpoint of CV death, MI and stroke\n(PEGASUS)\n\nTable 5 - Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PEGASUS)\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice daily +ASA\nN = 7045\n\nASA alone\nN = 7067\n\np-value\n\nCharacteristic\nPatients \n\nwith events\nKM %\n\nHR\n(95% CI)\n\nPatients with \nevents\n\nKM %\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\n\n\n20\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice daily +ASA\nN = 7045\n\nASA alone\nN = 7067\n\np-value\n\nCharacteristic\nPatients \n\nwith events\nKM %\n\nHR\n(95% CI)\n\nPatients with \nevents\n\nKM %\n\nComposite of CV \nDeath/MI/Stroke\n\n487 (6.9%) 7.8%\n0.84 \n\n(0.74, 0.95)\n578 (8.2%) 9.0% 0.0043 (s)\n\nCV death 174 (2.5%) 2.9%\n0.83 \n\n(0.68, 1.01)\n210 (3.0%) 3.4% 0.0676\n\nMI 285 (4.0%) 4.5%\n0.84 \n\n(0.72, 0.98)\n338 (4.8%) 5.2% 0.0314\n\nStroke 91 (1.3%) 1.5%\n0.75 \n\n(0.57, 0.98)\n122 (1.7%) 1.9% 0.0337\n\nSecondary endpoint\n\nCV death 174 (2.5%) 2.9%\n0.83 \n\n(0.68, 1.01)\n210 (3.0%) 3.4% -\n\nAll-cause \nmortality\n\n289 (4.1%) 4.7%\n0.89\n\n(0.76, 1.04)\n326 (4.6%) 5.2% -\n\nHazard ratio and p-values are calculated separately for ticagrelor vs. ASA therapy alone from Cox proportional hazards \n\nmodel with treatment group as the only explanatory variable.\n\nKM percentage calculated at 36 months.\n\nNote: the number of first events for the components CV death, MI and stroke are the actual number of first events for \n\neach component and do not add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint\n\n(s) Indicates statistical significance.\n\nCI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; MI = Myocardial infarction; \n\nN = Number of patients.\n\nBoth 60 mg twice daily and 90 mg twice daily regimens of ticagrelor in combination with ASA\nwere superior to ASA alone in the prevention of atherothrombotic events (composite endpoint: CV \ndeath, MI and stroke), with a consistent treatment effect over the entire study period, yielding a \n16% RRR and 1.27% ARR for ticagrelor 60 mg and a 15% RRR and 1.19% ARR for ticagrelor \n90 mg.\n\nAlthough the efficacy profiles of 90 mg and 60 mg were similar, there is evidence that the lower \ndose has a better tolerability and safety profile in relation to risk of the bleeding and dyspnoea. \nTherefore, only Brilique 60 mg twice daily co-administered with ASA is recommended for the \nprevention atherothrombotic events (CV death, MI and stroke) in patients with a history of MI and \na high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.\n\nRelative to ASA alone, ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced the primary composite \nendpoint of CV death, MI and stroke. Each of the components contributed to the reduction in the \nprimary composite endpoint (CV death 17% RRR, MI 16% RRR and stroke 25% RRR).\n\nThe RRR for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and \nonwards (16% RRR) was similar. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor \nbeyond 3 years of extended treatment.\n\nThere was no evidence of benefit (no reduction in the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI \nand stroke, but an increase in major bleeding) when ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was introduced in \n\n\n\n21\n\nclinically stable patients >2 years from the MI, or more than one year after stopping previous ADP \nreceptor inhibitor treatment (see also section 4.2).\n\nClinical safety\nThe rate of discontinuations with ticagrelor 60 mg due to bleeding and dyspnoea was higher in \npatients >75 years (42%) than in younger patients (range: 23-31%), with a difference versus \nplacebo higher than 10% (42% vs. 29%) in patients >75 years.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBrilique in all subsets of the paediatric population in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and history \nof myocardial infarction (MI) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nTicagrelor demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics and exposure to ticagrelor and the active \nmetabolite (AR-C124910XX) are approximately dose proportional up to 1260 mg.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of ticagrelor is rapid with a median tmax of approximately 1.5 hours. The formation of \nthe major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (also active) from ticagrelor is rapid with a \nmedian tmax of approximately 2.5 hours. Following an oral ticagrelor 90 mg single dose under \nfasted conditions in healthy subjects, Cmax is 529 ng/ml and AUC is 3451 ng*h/ml. The metabolite \nparent ratios are 0.28 for Cmax and 0.42 for AUC. The pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and \nAR-C124910XX in patients with a history of MI were generally similar to that in the ACS \npopulation. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the PEGASUS study the median \nticagrelor Cmax was 391 ng/ml and AUC was 3801 ng*h/ml at steady state for ticagrelor 60 mg. For \nticagrelor 90 mg Cmax was 627 ng/ml and AUC was 6255 ng*h/ml at steady state.\n\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was estimated to be 36%. Ingestion of a high-fat \nmeal resulted in a 21% increase in ticagrelor AUC and 22% decrease in the active metabolite Cmax \nbut had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax or the AUC of the active metabolite. These small changes are \nconsidered of minimal clinical significance; therefore, ticagrelor can be given with or without food. \nTicagrelor as well as the active metabolite are P-gp substrates.\n\nTicagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric \ntube into the stomach, has a comparable bioavailability to whole tablets with regards to AUC and \nCmax for ticagrelor and the active metabolite. Initial exposure (0.5 and 1 hour post-dose) from \ncrushed ticagrelor tablets mixed in water was higher compared to whole tablets, with a generally \nidentical concentration profile thereafter (2 to 48 hours).\n\nDistribution\nThe steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 87.5 l. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite\nis extensively bound to human plasma protein (>99.0%).\n\nBiotransformation\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of the active \nmetabolite and their interactions with other CYP3A substrates ranges from activation through to \ninhibition. \n\n\n\n22\n\nThe major metabolite of ticagrelor is AR-C124910XX, which is also active as assessed by in vitro\nbinding to the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is \napproximately 30-40% of that obtained for ticagrelor.\n\nElimination\nThe primary route of ticagrelor elimination is via hepatic metabolism. When radiolabelled \nticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (57.8% in \nfaeces, 26.5% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less \nthan 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the active metabolite is most likely via \nbiliary secretion. The mean t1/2 was approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 8.5 hours for the \nactive metabolite.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor (approximately 25% for both Cmax and AUC) and the active \nmetabolite were observed in elderly (\u226575years) ACS patients compared to younger patients by the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. These differences are not considered clinically significant \n(see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nTicagrelor has not been evaluated in a paediatric population (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nGender\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor and the active metabolite were observed in women compared to \nmen. These differences are not considered clinically significant.\n\nRenal impairment\nExposure to ticagrelor was approximately 20% lower and exposure to the active metabolite was \napproximately 17% higher in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n\nIn patients with end stage renal disease on haemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg \nadministered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was \nadministered immediately prior to dialysis (49% and 61%, respectively) showing that ticagrelor is \nnot dialysable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent (AUC 13-14% and\nCmax 17-36%). The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) effect of ticagrelor was independent of \ndialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to subjects with normal renal function \n(see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nCmax and AUC for ticagrelor were 12% and 23% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment \ncompared to matched healthy subjects, respectively, however, the IPA effect of ticagrelor was \nsimilar between the two groups. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment. Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and there is \nno pharmacokinetic information in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In patients that had \nmoderate or severe elevation in one or more liver function tests at baseline, ticagrelor plasma \nconcentrations were on average similar or slightly higher as compared to those without baseline \nelevations. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n23\n\nEthnicity\nPatients of Asian descent have a 39% higher mean bioavailability compared to Caucasian patients. \nPatients self-identified as black had an 18% lower bioavailability of ticagrelor compared to \nCaucasian patients, in clinical pharmacology studies, the exposure (Cmax and AUC) to ticagrelor in \nJapanese subjects was approximately 40% (20% after adjusting for body weight) higher compared \nto that in Caucasians. The exposure in patients self-identified as Hispanic or Latino was similar to \nthat in Caucasians.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPreclinical data for ticagrelor and its major metabolite have not demonstrated unacceptable risk for \nadverse effects for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxic potential.\n\nGastrointestinal irritation was observed in several animal species at clinical relevant exposure \nlevels (see section 4.8).\n\nIn female rats, ticagrelor at high dose showed an increased incidence of uterine tumours \n(adenocarcinomas) and an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas. The mechanism for uterine \ntumours is likely hormonal imbalance which can lead to tumours in rats. The mechanism for the \nhepatic adenomas is likely due to a rodent-specific enzyme induction in the liver. Thus, the \ncarcinogenicity findings are considered unlikely to be relevant for humans.\n\nIn rats, minor developmental anomalies were seen at a maternal toxic dose (safety margin of 5.1). \nIn rabbits, a slight delay in hepatic maturity and skeletal development was seen in foetuses from \ndams at high dose without showing maternal toxicity (safety margin of 4.5).\n\nStudies in rats and rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity, with slightly reduced maternal body \nweight gain and reduced neonatal viability and birth weight, with delayed growth. Ticagrelor \nproduced irregular cycles (mostly extended cycles) in female rats, but did not affect overall fertility \nin male and female rats. Pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled ticagrelor have \nshown that the parent compound and its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats (see \nsection 4.6).\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBrilique 90 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 90 mg ticagrelor.\nBrilique contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nRound, biconvex, yellow tablets marked with \u201890\u2019 above \u2018T\u2019 on one side and plain on the other.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBrilique, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \natherothrombotic events in adult patients with \n\n- acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or\n- a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic \n\nevent (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPatients taking Brilique should also take a daily low maintenance dose of ASA 75-150 mg, unless \nspecifically contraindicated.\n\nAcute coronary syndromes\nBrilique treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and \nthen continued at 90 mg twice daily.Treatment with Brilique 90 mg twice daily is recommended \nfor 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated (see section 5.1).\n\nHistory of myocardial infarction\nBrilique 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for \npatients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event (see \nsection 5.1). Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial \none-year treatment with Brilique 90 mg or other adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor \ntherapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be \ninitiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor \ninhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of \nextended treatment.\n\n\n\n26\n\nIf a switch is needed, the first dose of Brilique should be administered 24 hours following the last \ndose of the other antiplatelet medication.\n\nMissed dose\nLapses in therapy should also be avoided. A patient who misses a dose of Brilique should take only \none tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTicagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these \npatients is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). Only limited information is available in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor\nshould be used with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for patients \nwith mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in children below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \nFor oral use.\nBrilique can be administered with or without food.\nFor patients who are unable to swallow the tablet(s) whole, the tablets can be crushed to a fine \npowder and mixed in half a glass of water and drunk immediately. The glass should be rinsed with \na further half glass of water and the contents drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a \nnasogastric tube (CH8 or greater). It is important to flush the nasogastric tube through with water \nafter administration of the mixture.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\uf0b7 Active pathological bleeding.\n\uf0b7 History of intracranial haemorrhage (see section 4.8).\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\uf0b7 Co-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole,\n\nclarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and atazanavir), as co-administration may lead to a \nsubstantial increase in exposure to ticagrelor (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBleeding risk\nThe use of ticagrelor in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against \nthe benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). If \nclinically indicated, ticagrelor should be used with caution in the following patient groups:\n\n\n\n27\n\n\uf0b7 Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation \ndisorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). The use of ticagrelor is contraindicated \nin patients with active pathological bleeding, in those with a history of intracranial \nhaemorrhage, and in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\n\uf0b7 Patients with concomitant administration of medicinal products that may increase the risk of \nbleeding (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral anticoagulants and/or \nfibrinolytics) within 24 hours of ticagrelor dosing.\n\nPlatelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is \nunlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Since co-administration of ticagrelor\nwith desmopressin did not decrease template-bleeding time, desmopressin is unlikely to be \neffective in managing clinical bleeding events (see section 4.5).\n\nAntifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa\ntherapy may increase haemostasis. Ticagrelor may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been \nidentified and controlled.\n\nSurgery\nPatients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking ticagrelor before \nany surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken.\n\nIn PLATO patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ticagrelor had more \nbleeding than clopidogrel when stopped within 1 day prior to surgery but a similar rate of major \nbleeds compared to clopidogrel after stopping therapy 2 or more days before surgery (see \nsection 4.8). If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is not desired, \nticagrelor should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery (see section 5.1).\n\nPatients with prior ischaemic stroke\nACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with ticagrelor for up to 12 months \n(PLATO study).\n\nIn PEGASUS, patients with history of MI with prior ischaemic stroke were not included. \nTherefore, in the absence of data, treatment beyond one year is not recommended in these patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nUse of ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.3). There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, \ntherefore, caution is advised in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients at risk for bradycardic events\nHolter ECG monitoring has shown an increased frequency of mostly asymptomatic ventricular \npauses during treatment with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. Patients with an increased risk \nof bradycardic events (e.g. patients without a pacemaker who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd\n\ndegree AV block or bradycardic-related syncope) have been excluded from the main studies \nevaluating the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor. Therefore, due to the limited clinical experience, \nticagrelor should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.1).\n\nIn addition, caution should be exercised when administering ticagrelor concomitantly with \nmedicinal products known to induce bradycardia. However, no evidence of clinically significant \nadverse reactions was observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or \nmore medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium \nchannel blockers diltiazem and verapamil and 4% digoxin) (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n28\n\nDuring the Holter substudy in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses >3 seconds with \nticagrelor than with clopidogrel during the acute phase of their ACS. The increase in \nHolter-detected ventricular pauses with ticagrelor was higher in patients with chronic heart failure \n(CHF) than in the overall study population during the acute phase of ACS, but not at one month \nwith ticagrelor or compared to clopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated \nwith this imbalance (including syncope or pacemaker insertion) in this patient population (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nDyspnoea\nDyspnoea was reported in patients treated with ticagrelor. Dyspnoea is usually mild to moderate in \nintensity and often resolves without need for treatment discontinuation. Patients with \nasthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of \nexperiencing dyspnoea with ticagrelor. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with \nhistory of asthma and/or COPD. The mechanism has not been elucidated. If a patient reports new, \nprolonged or worsened dyspnoea this should be investigated fully and if not tolerated, treatment \nwith ticagrelor should be stopped. For further details see section 4.8.\n\nCreatinine elevations\nCreatinine levels may increase during treatment with ticagrelor. The mechanism has not been \nelucidated. Renal function should be checked according to routine medical practice. In patients \nwith ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the \ntreatment with ticagrelor, paying special attention to patients \u226575 years, patients with \nmoderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin\nreceptor blocker (ARB).\n\nUric acid increase\nHyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with ticagrelor (see section 4.8). Caution is advised in\npatients with history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. As a precautionary measure, the use of \nticagrelor in patients with uric acid nephropathy is discouraged.\n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely with the use of \nticagrelor. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia \nassociated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever. TTP is a potentially fatal \ncondition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis.\n\nInterference with platelet function tests to diagnose heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)\nIn the heparin induced platelet activation (HIPA) test used to diagnose HIT, anti-platelet factor \n4/heparin antibodies in patient serum activate platelets of healthy donors in the presence of \nheparin.\nFalse negative results in a platelet function test (to include, but may not be limited to the HIPA \ntest) for HIT have been reported in patients administered ticagrelor. This is related to inhibition of \nthe P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the patient\u2019s \nsera/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of \nHIT platelet function tests. \nIn patients who have developed HIT, the benefit-risk of continued treatment with ticagrelor should \nbe assessed, taking both the prothrombotic state of HIT and the increased risk of bleeding with \nconcomitant anticoagulant and ticagrelor treatment into consideration.\n\nOther\n\n\n\n29\n\nBased on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance ASA dose and relative efficacy \nof ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of ticagrelor and high maintenance dose \nASA (>300 mg) is not recommended (see section 5.1).\n\nPremature discontinuation\nPremature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Brilique, could result in an \nincreased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI or stroke due to the patient\u2019s underlying disease. \nTherefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTicagrelor is primarily a CYP3A4 substrate and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Ticagrelor is also a \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and a weak P-gp inhibitor and may increase the exposure of P-gp \nsubstrates.\n\nEffects of medicinal and other products on ticagrelor\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\n\uf0b7 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of ketoconazole with ticagrelor increased the \n\nticagrelor Cmax and AUC equal to 2.4-fold and 7.3-fold, respectively. The Cmax and AUC of \nthe active metabolite were reduced by 89% and 56%, respectively. Other strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and atazanavir) would be expected to have \nsimilar effects and therefore concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ticagrelor is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\n\uf0b7 Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of diltiazem with ticagrelor increased the \nticagrelor Cmax by 69% and AUC to 2.7-fold and decreased the active metabolite Cmax by \n38% and AUC was unchanged. There was no effect of ticagrelor on diltiazem plasma levels. \nOther moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, erythromycin and \nfluconazole) would be expected to have a similar effect and can as well be co-administered \nwith ticagrelor. \n\n\uf0b7 A 2-fold increase of ticagrelor exposure was observed after daily consumption of large \nquantities of grapefruit juice (3x200 ml). This magnitude of increased exposure is not \nexpected to be clinically relevant to most patients.\n\nCYP3A inducers\nCo-administration of rifampicin with ticagrelor decreased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC by 73% and \n86%, respectively. The Cmax of the active metabolite was unchanged and the AUC was decreased \nby 46%, respectively. Other CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) \nwould be expected to decrease the exposure to ticagrelor as well. Co-administration of ticagrelor \nwith potent CYP3A inducers may decrease exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor, therefore, their \nconcomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged.\n\nCyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor)\nCo-administration of cyclosporine (600 mg) with ticagrelor increased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC \nequal to 2.3-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. The AUC of the active metabolite was increased by \n32% and Cmax was decreased by 15% in the presence of cyclosporine. \n\nNo data are available on concomitant use of ticagrelor with other active substances that also are \npotent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may \nincrease ticagrelor exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be \nmade with caution.\n\n\n\n30\n\nOthers\nClinical pharmacology interaction studies showed that co-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, \nenoxaparin and ASA or desmopressin did not have any effect on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor \nor the active metabolite or on ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with ticagrelor alone. If \nclinically indicated, medicinal products that alter haemostasis should be used with caution in \ncombination with ticagrelor.\n\nA delayed and decreased exposure to oral P2Y12 inhibitors, including ticagrelor and its active \n\nmetabolite, has been observed in patients with ACS treated with morphine (35% reduction in \n\nticagrelor exposure). This interaction may be related to reduced gastrointestinal motility and apply \n\nto other opioids. The clinical relevance is unknown, but data indicate the potential for reduced \n\nticagrelor efficacy in patients co-administered ticagrelor and morphine. In patients with ACS, in \n\nwhom morphine cannot be withheld and fast P2Y12 inhibition is deemed crucial, the use of a \n\nparenteral P2Y12 inhibitor may be considered.\n\nEffects of ticagrelor on other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4\n\uf0b7 Simvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of ticagrelor with simvastatin increased simvastatin Cmax by \n\n81% and AUC by 56% and increased simvastatin acid Cmax by 64% and AUC by 52% with \nsome individual increases equal to 2- to 3-fold. Co-administration of ticagrelor with doses of \nsimvastatin exceeding 40 mg daily could cause adverse reactions of simvastatin and should \nbe weighed against potential benefits. There was no effect of simvastatin on ticagrelor \nplasma levels. Ticagrelor may have similar effect on lovastatin. The concomitant use of \nticagrelor with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended.\n\n\uf0b7 Atorvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of atorvastatin and ticagrelor increased atorvastatin acid \nCmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all \natorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant.\n\n\uf0b7 A similar effect on other statins metabolised by CYP3A4 cannot be excluded. Patients in \nPLATO receiving ticagrelor took a variety of statins, with no concern of an association with \nstatin safety among the 93% of the PLATO cohort taking these medicinal products. \n\nTicagrelor is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of ticagrelor and CYP3A4 substrates \nwith narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as ticagrelor \nmay increase the exposure to these medicinal products.\n\nP-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine) \nConcomitant administration of ticagrelor increased the digoxin Cmax by 75% and AUC by 28%. \nThe mean trough digoxin levels were increased about 30% with ticagrelor co-administration with \nsome individual maximum increases to 2-fold. In the presence of digoxin, the Cmax and AUC of \nticagrelor and its active metabolite were not affected. Therefore, appropriate clinical and/or \nlaboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent \nmedicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with ticagrelor.\n\nThere was no effect of ticagrelor on cyclosporine blood levels. Effect of ticagrelor on other P-gp \nsubstrates has not been studied.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of \neither medicinal product, which suggests that ticagrelor is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to \nalter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide.\n\n\n\n31\n\nOral contraceptives\nCo-administration of ticagrelor and levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol increased ethinyl estradiol \nexposure approximately 20% but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel. No \nclinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl \nestradiol are co-administered with ticagrelor.\n\nMedicinal products known to induce bradycardia\nDue to observations of mostly asymptomatic ventricular pauses and bradycardia, caution should be \nexercised when administering ticagrelor concomitantly with medicinal products known to induce \nbradycardia (see section 4.4). However, no evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions was \nobserved in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products \nknown to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and \nverapamil and 4% digoxin).\n\nOther concomitant therapy\nIn clinical studies, ticagrelor was commonly administered with ASA, proton pump inhibitors, \nstatins, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor \nblockers as needed for concomitant conditions for long-term and also heparin, low molecular \nweight heparin and intravenous GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors for short durations (see section 5.1). No \nevidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products was observed.\n\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin had no effect on \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated coagulation time (ACT) or factor Xa \nassays. However, due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with \nthe concomitant administration of ticagrelor with medicinal products known to alter haemostasis.\n\nDue to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and \ncitalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with ticagrelor as this may increase the \nrisk of bleeding.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid \npregnancy during ticagrelor therapy.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ticagrelor in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ticagrelor is not recommended during \npregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and \nits active metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A \ndecision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nticagrelor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nTicagrelor had no effect on male or female fertility in animals (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\n\n\n32\n\nTicagrelor has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. During treatment \nwith ticagrelor, dizziness and confusion have been reported. Therefore, patients who experience \nthese symptoms should be cautious while driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of ticagrelor has been evaluated in two large phase 3 outcome trials (PLATO and \nPEGASUS) including more than 39,000 patients (see section 5.1).\n\nIn PLATO, patients on ticagrelor had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events \nthan clopidogrel (7.4% vs. 5.4%). In PEGASUS, patients on ticagrelor had a higher incidence of \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events compared to ASA therapy alone (16.1% for ticagrelor 60 mg \nwith ASA vs. 8.5% for ASA therapy alone). The most commonly reported adverse reactions in \npatients treated with ticagrelor were bleeding and dyspnoea (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified following studies or have been reported in\npost-marketing experience with ticagrelor (Table 1). \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Within each SOC the \nadverse reactions are ranked by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined according to \nthe following conventions: Very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to \uf03c1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \uf03c1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Adverse reactions by frequency and system organ class (SOC)\n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps)\n\nTumour \nbleedingsa\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nBlood disorder \nbleedingsb\n\nThrombotic \nThrombocytopenic \nPurpurac\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity \nincluding \nangioedemac\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nHyperuricaemiad Gout/Gouty \n\nArthritis\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nConfusion\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nDizziness,\nSyncope, \nHeadache\n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage \n\n\n\n33\n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nEye disorders Eye \nhaemorrhagee\n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders\n\nVertigo Ear \nhaemorrhage\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nHypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea Respiratory \nsystem \nbleedingsf\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhageg, \nDiarrhoea, \nNausea, \nDyspepsia, \nConstipation\n\nRetroperitoneal \nhaemorrhage\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nSubcutaneous or \ndermal \nbleedingh, Rash, \nPruritus \n\nMusculoskeletal \nconnective tissue \nand bone\n\nMuscular \nbleedingsi\n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nUrinary tract \nbleedingj\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders\n\nReproductive \nsystem \nbleedingsk\n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine \nincreasedd\n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications\n\nPost procedural \nhaemorrhage, \nTraumatic \nbleedingsl\n\na e.g. bleeding from bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer\nb e.g. increased tendency to bruise, spontaneous haematoma, haemorrhagic diathesis\nc Identified in post-marketing experience\nd Frequencies derived from lab observations (Uric acid increases to >upper limit of normal from baseline below or within \nreference range.

However, \nmore PLATO combined Major + Minor bleeding occurred with ticagrelor compared with \nclopidogrel. Few patients in PLATO had fatal bleeds: 20 (0.2%) for ticagrelor and 23 (0.3%) for \nclopidogrel (see section 4.4).\n\nAge, sex, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy and medical \nhistory, including a previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, all did not predict either overall \nor non-procedural PLATO Major bleeding. Thus, no particular group was identified at risk for any \nsubset of bleeding.\n\nCABG-related bleeding:\nIn PLATO, 42% of the 1584 patients (12% of cohort) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft \n(CABG) surgery had a PLATO Major Fatal/Life-threatening bleeding with no difference between \ntreatment groups. Fatal CABG bleeding occurred in 6 patients in each treatment group (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nNon-CABG related bleeding and non-procedural related bleeding:\nTicagrelor and clopidogrel did not differ in non-CABG PLATO-defined Major Fatal/Life-\nthreatening bleeding, but PLATO-defined Total Major, TIMI Major, and TIMI Major + Minor \nbleeding were more common with ticagrelor. Similarly, when removing all procedure related \nbleeds, more bleeding occurred with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel (Table 2). Discontinuation of \n\n\n\n35\n\ntreatment due to non-procedural bleeding was more common for ticagrelor (2.9%) than for \nclopidogrel (1.2%; p<0.001).\n\nIntracranial bleeding: \nThere were more intracranial non-procedural bleeds with ticagrelor (n=27 bleeds in 26 patients, \n0.3%) than with clopidogrel (n=14 bleeds, 0.2%), of which 11 bleeds with ticagrelor and 1 with \nclopidogrel were fatal. There was no difference in overall fatal bleeds.\n\nBleeding findings in PEGASUS\nOverall outcome of bleeding events in the PEGASUS study are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Analysis of overall bleeding events, Kaplan-Meier estimates at 36 months \n(PEGASUS)\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice \n\ndaily + ASA\n\nN=6958\n\nASA alone\n\nN=6996\n\nSafety Endpoints KM%\n\nHazard \nRatio\n\n(95% CI)\n\nKM% p-value\n\nTIMI-defined bleeding categories\n\nTIMI    Major\n2.3 2.32\n\n(1.68, 3.21)\n\n1.1 <0.0001\n\nFatal\n0.3 1.00\n\n(0.44, 2.27)\n\n0.3 1.0000\n\nICH\n0.6 1.33\n\n(0.77, 2.31)\n\n0.5 0.3130\n\nOther TIMI Major\n1.6 3.61\n\n(2.31, 5.65)\n\n0.5 <0.0001\n\nTIMI Major or Minor\n3.4 2.54\n\n(1.93, 3.35)\n\n1.4 <0.0001\n\nTIMI Major or Minor or Requiring \n\nmedical attention\n\n16.6 2.64\n\n(2.35, 2.97)\n\n7.0 <0.0001\n\nPLATO-defined bleeding categories\n\nPLATO Major\n3.5 2.57\n\n(1.95, 3.37)\n\n1.4 <0.0001\n\nFatal/Life-threatening\n2.4 2.38\n\n(1.73, 3.26)\n\n1.1 <0.0001\n\nOther PLATO Major\n1.1 3.37\n\n(1.95, 5.83)\n\n0.3 <0.0001\n\nPLATO Major or Minor\n15.2 2.71\n\n(2.40, 3.08)\n\n6.2 <0.0001\n\nBleeding category definitions:\n\nTIMI Major: Fatal bleeding, OR any intracranial bleeding, OR clinically overt signs of haemorrhage associated with a \n\ndrop in haemoglobin (Hgb) of \u226550 g/L, or when Hgb is not available, a fall in haematocrit (Hct) of 15%.\n\nFatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days.\n\nICH: Intracranial haemorrhage.\n\nOther TIMI Major: Non-fatal non-ICH TIMI Major bleeding.\n\nTIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 30-50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin.\n\n\n\n36\n\nTIMI Requiring medical attention: Requiring intervention, OR leading to hospitalisation, OR prompting evaluation.\n\nPLATO Major Fatal/life-threatening: Fatal bleeding, OR any intracranial bleeding, OR intrapericardial with cardiac \n\ntamponade, OR with hypovolaemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors/inotropes or surgery OR clinically \n\napparent with >50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin or \u22654 red cell units transfused.\n\nPLATO Major Other: Significantly disabling, OR clinically apparent with 30-50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin, OR \n\n2-3 red cell units transfused.\n\nPLATO Minor: Requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding.\n\nIn PEGASUS, TIMI Major bleeding for ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was higher than for ASA \nalone. No increased bleeding risk was seen for fatal bleeding and only a minor increase was \nobserved in intracranial haemorrhages, as compared to ASA therapy alone. There were few fatal \nbleeding events in the study, 11 (0.3%) for ticagrelor 60 mg and 12 (0.3%) for ASA therapy alone. \nThe observed increased risk of TIMI Major bleeding with ticagrelor 60 mg was primarily due to a \nhigher frequency of Other TIMI Major bleedings driven by events in the gastrointestinal SOC.\n\nIncreased bleeding patterns similar to TIMI Major were seen for TIMI Major or Minor and \nPLATO Major and PLATO Major or Minor bleeding categories (see Table 3). Discontinuation of \ntreatment due to bleeding was more common with ticagrelor 60 mg compared to ASA therapy \nalone (6.2% and 1.5%, respectively). The majority of these bleedings were of less severity \n(classified as TIMI Requiring medical attention), e.g. epistaxis, bruising and haematomas.\n\nThe bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups \n(e.g. by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy \nand medical history) for TIMI Major, TIMI Major or Minor and PLATO Major bleeding events.\n\nIntracranial bleeding:\nSpontaneous ICHs were reported in similar rates for ticagrelor 60 mg and ASA therapy alone\n(n=13, 0.2% in both treatment groups). Traumatic and procedural ICHs showed a minor increase \nwith ticagrelor 60 mg treatment, (n=15, 0.2%) compared with ASA therapy alone (n=10, 0.1%). \nThere were 6 fatal ICHs with ticagrelor 60 mg and 5 fatal ICHs with ASA therapy alone. The \nincidence of intracranial bleeding was low in both treatment groups given the significant \ncomorbidity and CV risk factors of the population under study.\n\nDyspnoea\nDyspnoea, a sensation of breathlessness, is reported by patients treated with ticagrelor. In PLATO, \ndyspnoea adverse events (AEs) (dyspnoea, dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea exertional, dyspnoea \nparoxysmal nocturnal and nocturnal dyspnoea), when combined, was reported by 13.8% of patients \ntreated with ticagrelor and by 7.8% of patients treated with clopidogrel. In 2.2% of patients taking \nticagrelor and by 0.6% taking clopidogrel investigators considered the dyspnoea causally related to \ntreatment in the PLATO study and few were serious (0.14% ticagrelor; 0.02% clopidogrel), (see \nsection 4.4). Most reported symptoms of dyspnoea were mild to moderate in intensity, and most \nwere reported as a single episode early after starting treatment.\n\nCompared with clopidogrel, patients with asthma/COPD treated with ticagrelor may have an \nincreased risk of experiencing non-serious dyspnoea (3.29% ticagrelor versus 0.53% clopidogrel) \nand serious dyspnoea (0.38% ticagrelor versus 0.00% clopidogrel). In absolute terms, this risk was \nhigher than in the overall PLATO population. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients \nwith history of asthma and/or COPD (see section 4.4).\n\nAbout 30% of episodes resolved within 7 days. PLATO included patients with baseline congestive \nheart failure, COPD or asthma; these patients, and the elderly, were more likely to report dyspnoea.\nFor ticagrelor, 0.9% of patients discontinued study drug because of dyspnoea compared with \n\n\n\n37\n\n0.1% taking clopidogrel. The higher incidence of dyspnoea with ticagrelor is not associated with \nnew or worsening heart or lung disease (see section 4.4). Ticagrelor does not affect tests of \npulmonary function.\n\nIn PEGASUS, dyspnoea was reported in 14.2% of patients taking ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily and \nin 5.5% of patients taking ASA alone. As in PLATO, most reported dyspnoea was mild to \nmoderate in intensity (see section 4.4). Patients who reported dyspnoea tended to be older and \nmore frequently had dyspnoea, COPD or asthma at baseline.\n\nInvestigations\nUric acid elevations: In PLATO, serum uric acid increased to more than upper limit of normal in \n22% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 13% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The \ncorresponding numbers in PEGASUS were 9.1%, 8.8% and 5.5% for ticagrelor 90 mg, 60 mg and \nplacebo, respectively. Mean serum uric acid increased approximately 15% with ticagrelor \ncompared to approximately 7.5% with clopidogrel and after treatment was stopped, decreased to \napproximately 7% on ticagrelor but with no decrease observed for clopidogrel. In PEGASUS, a \nreversible increase in mean serum uric acid levels of 6.3% and 5.6% was found for ticagrelor \n90 mg and 60 mg, respectively, compared to a 1.5% decrease in the placebo group. In PLATO, the \nfrequency of gouty arthritis was 0.2% for ticagrelor vs. 0.1% for clopidogrel. The corresponding \nnumbers for gout/gouty arthritis in PEGASUS were 1.6%, 1.5% and 1.1% for ticagrelor 90 mg, \n60 mg and placebo, respectively.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nTicagrelor is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was \ndose-limiting in a single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions \nwhich may occur with overdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses (see section 4.8).\n\nIn the event of an overdose, the above potential adverse reactions could occur and ECG monitoring\nshould be considered.\n\nThere is currently no known antidote to reverse the effects of ticagrelor, and ticagrelor is not \ndialysable (see section 5.2). Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. \nThe expected effect of excessive ticagrelor dosing is prolonged duration of bleeding risk associated \nwith platelet inhibition. Platelet transfusion is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with \nbleeding (see section 4.4). If bleeding occurs other appropriate supportive measures should be \ntaken.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, ATC code: \nB01AC24\n\nMechanism of action\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n38\n\nBrilique contains ticagrelor, a member of the chemical class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines \n(CPTP), which is an oral, direct acting, selective and reversibly binding P2Y12 receptor antagonist \nthat prevents ADP-mediated P2Y12 dependent platelet activation and aggregation. Ticagrelor does \nnot prevent ADP binding but when bound to the P2Y12 receptor prevents ADP-induced signal \ntransduction. Since platelets participate in the initiation and/or evolution of thrombotic \ncomplications of atherosclerotic disease, inhibition of platelet function has been shown to reduce \nthe risk of CV events such as death, MI or stroke.\n\nTicagrelor also increases local endogenous adenosine levels by inhibiting the equilibrative \nnucleoside transporter-1 (ENT-1). \n\nTicagrelor has been documented to augment the following adenosine-induced effects in healthy \nsubjects and in patients with ACS: vasodilation (measured by coronary blood flow increases in \nhealthy volunteers and ACS patients; headache), inhibition of platelet function (in human whole \nblood in vitro) and dyspnoea. However, a link between the observed increases in adenosine and \nclinical outcomes (e.g. morbidity-mortality) has not been clearly elucidated.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nOnset of action\nIn patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ASA, ticagrelor demonstrates a rapid \nonset of pharmacological effect as demonstrated by a mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) \nfor ticagrelor at 0.5 hours after 180 mg loading dose of about 41%, with the maximum IPA effect \nof 89% by 2-4 hours post dose, and maintained between 2-8 hours. 90% of patients had final extent \nIPA>70% by 2 hours post dose.\n\nOffset of action\nIf a CABG procedure is planned, ticagrelor bleeding risk is increased compared to clopidogrel \nwhen discontinued within less than 96 hours prior to procedure.\n\nSwitching data\nSwitching from clopidogrel 75 mg to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily results in an absolute IPA \nincrease of 26.4% and switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel results in an absolute IPA decrease \nof 24.5%. Patients can be switched from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without any interruption of \nantiplatelet effect (see section 4.2).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor is derived from two phase 3 trials:\n\n\uf0b7 The PLATO [PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes] study, a comparison of ticagrelor \nto clopidogrel, both given in combination with ASA and other standard therapy.\n\n\uf0b7 The PEGASUS TIMI-54 [PrEvention with TicaGrelor of SecondAry Thrombotic Events in \nHigh-RiSk AcUte Coronary Syndrome Patients] study, a comparison of ticagrelor combined \nwith ASA to ASA therapy alone.\n\nPLATO study (Acute Coronary Syndromes)\n\nThe PLATO study included 18,624 patients who presented within 24 hours of onset of symptoms \nof unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST elevation \nmyocardial infarction (STEMI), and were initially managed medically, or with percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI), or with CABG.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\n\n\n39\n\nOn a background of daily ASA, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily showed superiority to 75 mg daily \nclopidogrel in preventing the composite endpoint of CV death, MI or stroke, with the difference \ndriven by CV death and MI. Patients received a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg \npossible if having PCI) or 180 mg of ticagrelor.\n\nThe result appeared early (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0.6% and relative risk reduction [RRR] \nof 12% at 30 days), with a constant treatment effect over the entire 12-month period, yielding ARR \n1.9% per year with RRR of 16%. This suggests it is appropriate to treat patients with ticagrelor 90 \nmg twice daily for 12 months (see section 4.2). Treating 54 ACS patients with ticagrelor instead of \nclopidogrel will prevent 1 atherothrombotic event; treating 91 will prevent 1 CV death (see \nFigure 1 and Table 4).\n\nThe treatment effect of ticagrelor over clopidogrel appears consistent across many subgroups, \nincluding weight; sex; medical history of diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attack or \nnon-haemorrhagic stroke, or revascularisation; concomitant therapies including heparins, \nGpIIb/IIIa inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors (see section 4.5); final index event diagnosis \n(STEMI, NSTEMI or UA); and treatment pathway intended at randomisation (invasive or \nmedical).\n\nA weakly significant treatment interaction was observed with region whereby the hazard ratio \n(HR) for the primary endpoint favours ticagrelor in the rest of world but favours clopidogrel in \nNorth America, which represented approximately 10% of the overall population studied \n(interaction p-value=0.045). Exploratory analyses suggest a possible association with ASA dose \nsuch that reduced efficacy was observed with ticagrelor with increasing ASA doses. Chronic daily \nASA doses to accompany ticagrelor should be 75-150 mg (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nFigure 1 shows the estimate of the risk to the first occurrence of any event in the composite efficacy \nendpoint.\n\n\n\n40\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Analysis of primary clinical composite endpoint of CV death, MI and stroke \n(PLATO)\n\nTicagrelor reduced the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint compared to clopidogrel in \nboth the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI population (Table 4). Thus, Brilique 90 mg twice daily together \nwith low-dose ASA can be used in patients with ACS (unstable angina, non-ST elevation \nMyocardial Infarction [NSTEMI] or ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]); including \npatients managed medically, and those who are managed with percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG).\n\nTable 4 - Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PLATO)\n\nTicagrelor\n90 mg\n\ntwice daily\n(% patients \nwith event)\n\nN=9333\n\nClopidogrel \n75 mg\n\nonce daily\n(% patients \nwith event)\n\nN=9291\n\nARRa\n\n(%/yr)\nRRRa (%)\n(95% CI)\n\np-value\n\nCV death, MI (excl. \nsilent MI) or stroke\n\n9.3 10.9 1.9 16 (8, 23) 0.0003\n\nInvasive intent 8.5 10.0 1.7 16 (6, 25) 0.0025\n\nMedical intent 11.3 13.2 2.3 15 (0.3, 27) 0.0444d\n\nCV death 3.8 4.8 1.1 21 (9, 31) 0.0013\n\nMI (excl. silent MI)b 5.4 6.4 1.1 16 (5, 25) 0.0045\nStroke 1.3 1.1 -0.2 -17 (-52, 9) 0.2249\n\n\n\n41\n\nAll-cause mortality, \nMI (excl. silent MI) \nor stroke\n\n9.7 11.5 2.1 16 (8, 23) 0.0001\n\nCV death, total MI, \nstroke, SRI, RI, TIA \nor other ATEc\n\n13.8 15.7 2.1 12 (5, 19) 0.0006\n\nAll-cause mortality 4.3 5.4 1.4 22 (11, 31) 0.0003d\n\nDefinite stent\nthrombosis\n\n1.2 1.7 0.6 32 (8, 49) 0.0123d\n\na ARR = absolute risk reduction; RRR = relative risk reduction = (1-Hazard ratio) x 100%.

The superiority of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in reducing \nmajor CV events was not significantly affected by patient CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Similar \nto the overall PLATO study, total PLATO Major bleeding did not differ between ticagrelor and \nclopidogrel, regardless of CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Non-CABG PLATO Major bleeding \nwas increased with ticagrelor compared clopidogrel in patients with one or more CYP2C19 loss of \nfunction alleles, but similar to clopidogrel in patients with no loss of function allele.\n\nCombined efficacy and safety composite\nA combined efficacy and safety composite (CV death, MI, stroke or PLATO-defined \u2018Total Major\u2019 \nbleeding) indicates that the benefit in efficacy of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel is not offset by \nthe major bleeding events (ARR 1.4%, RRR 8%, HR 0.92; p=0.0257) over 12 months after ACS.\n\nClinical safety\n\nHolter substudy:\nTo study the occurrence of ventricular pauses and other arrhythmic episodes during PLATO, \ninvestigators performed Holter monitoring in a subset of nearly 3000 patients, of whom \napproximately 2000 had recordings both in the acute phase of their ACS and after one month. The \nprimary variable of interest was the occurrence of ventricular pauses \u22653 seconds. More patients had \nventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; and \n2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month (see section 4.4). The increase in ventricular pauses in \nthe acute phase of ACS was more pronounced in ticagrelor patients with history of CHF (9.2% \nversus 5.4% in patients without CHF history; for clopidogrel patients, 4.0% in those with versus \n3.6% in those without CHF history). This imbalance did not occur at one month: 2.0% versus 2.1% \nfor ticagrelor patients with and without CHF history, respectively; and 3.8% versus 1.4% with \nclopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated with this imbalance \n(including pacemaker insertions) in this population of patients.\n\nPEGASUS study (History of Myocardial Infarction)\n\nThe PEGASUS TIMI-54 study was a 21,162 patient, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, parallel group, international multicentre study to assess the prevention of \natherothrombotic events with ticagrelor given at 2 doses (either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice \ndaily) combined with low dose ASA (75-150 mg), compared to ASA therapy alone in patients with \nhistory of MI and additional risk factors for atherothrombosis.\n\n\n\n42\n\nPatients were eligible to participate if they were aged 50 years or over, with a history of MI (1 to \n3 years prior to randomisation), and had at least one of the following risk factors for \natherothrombosis: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, a second prior MI, \nevidence of multivessel CAD or chronic non-end-stage renal dysfunction.\n\nPatients were ineligible if there was planned use of a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, dipyridamole, \ncilostazol, or anticoagulant therapy during the study period; if they had a bleeding disorder or a \nhistory of an ischaemic stroke or intracranial bleeding, a central nervous system tumour or an \nintracranial vascular abnormality; if they had had gastrointestinal bleeding within the previous \n6 months or major surgery within the previous 30 days.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nFigure 2 - Analysis of primary clinical composite endpoint of CV death, MI and stroke \n(PEGASUS)\n\nTable 5 - Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PEGASUS)\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice daily +ASA\nN = 7045\n\nASA alone\nN = 7067\n\np-value\n\nCharacteristic\nPatients \n\nwith events\nKM %\n\nHR\n(95% CI)\n\nPatients with \nevents\n\nKM %\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\n\n\n43\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice daily +ASA\nN = 7045\n\nASA alone\nN = 7067\n\np-value\n\nCharacteristic\nPatients \n\nwith events\nKM %\n\nHR\n(95% CI)\n\nPatients with \nevents\n\nKM %\n\nComposite of CV \nDeath/MI/Stroke\n\n487 (6.9%) 7.8%\n0.84 \n\n(0.74, 0.95)\n578 (8.2%) 9.0% 0.0043 (s)\n\nCV death 174 (2.5%) 2.9%\n0.83 \n\n(0.68, 1.01)\n210 (3.0%) 3.4% 0.0676\n\nMI 285 (4.0%) 4.5%\n0.84 \n\n(0.72, 0.98)\n338 (4.8%) 5.2% 0.0314\n\nStroke 91 (1.3%) 1.5%\n0.75 \n\n(0.57, 0.98)\n122 (1.7%) 1.9% 0.0337\n\nSecondary endpoint\n\nCV death 174 (2.5%) 2.9%\n0.83 \n\n(0.68, 1.01)\n210 (3.0%) 3.4% -\n\nAll-cause \nmortality\n\n289 (4.1%) 4.7%\n0.89\n\n(0.76, 1.04)\n326 (4.6%) 5.2% -\n\nHazard ratio and p-values are calculated separately for ticagrelor vs. ASA therapy alone from Cox proportional hazards \n\nmodel with treatment group as the only explanatory variable.\n\nKM percentage calculated at 36 months.\n\nNote: the number of first events for the components CV death, MI and stroke are the actual number of first events for \n\neach component and do not add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint\n\n(s) Indicates statistical significance.\n\nCI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; MI = Myocardial infarction; \n\nN = Number of patients.\n\nBoth 60 mg twice daily and 90 mg twice daily regimens of ticagrelor in combination with ASA\nwere superior to ASA alone in the prevention of atherothrombotic events (composite endpoint: CV \ndeath, MI and stroke), with a consistent treatment effect over the entire study period, yielding a \n16% RRR and 1.27% ARR for ticagrelor 60 mg and a 15% RRR and 1.19% ARR for ticagrelor \n90 mg.\n\nAlthough the efficacy profile of 90 mg and 60 mg were similar, there is evidence that the lower \ndose has a better tolerability and safety profile in relation to risk of the bleeding and dyspnoea. \nTherefore, only Brilique 60 mg twice daily co-administered with ASA is recommended for the \nprevention atherothrombotic events (CV death, MI and stroke) in patients with a history of MI and \na high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.\n\nRelative to ASA alone, ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced the primary composite \nendpoint of CV death, MI and stroke. Each of the components contributed to the reduction in the \nprimary composite endpoint (CV death 17% RRR, MI 16% RRR and stroke 25% RRR).\n\nThe RRR for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and \nonwards (16% RRR) was similar. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor \nbeyond 3 years of extended treatment.\n\nThere was no evidence of benefit (no reduction in the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI \nand stroke, but an increase in major bleeding) when ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was introduced in \n\n\n\n44\n\nclinically stable patients >2 years from the MI, or more than one year after stopping previous ADP \nreceptor inhibitor treatment (see also section 4.2).\n\nClinical safety\nThe rate of discontinuations with ticagrelor 60 mg due to bleeding and dyspnoea was higher in \npatients >75 years (42%) than in younger patients (range: 23-31%), with a difference versus \nplacebo higher than 10% (42% vs. 29%) in patients >75 years.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBrilique in all subsets of the paediatric population in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and history \nof myocardial infarction (MI) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nTicagrelor demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics and exposure to ticagrelor and the active \nmetabolite (AR-C124910XX) are approximately dose proportional up to 1260 mg.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of ticagrelor is rapid with a median tmax of approximately 1.5 hours. The formation of \nthe major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (also active) from ticagrelor is rapid with a \nmedian tmax of approximately 2.5 hours. Following an oral ticagrelor 90 mg single dose under \nfasted conditions in healthy subjects, Cmax is 529 ng/ml and AUC is 3451 ng*h/ml. The metabolite \nparent ratios are 0.28 for Cmax and 0.42 for AUC. The pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and \nAR-C124910XX in patients with a history of MI were generally similar to that in the ACS \npopulation. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the PEGASUS study the median \nticagrelor Cmax was 391 ng/ml and AUC was 3801 ng*h/ml at steady state for ticagrelor 60 mg. For \nticagrelor 90 mg Cmax was 627 ng/ml and AUC was 6255 ng*h/ml at steady state.\n\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was estimated to be 36%. Ingestion of a high-fat \nmeal resulted in a 21% increase in ticagrelor AUC and 22% decrease in the active metabolite Cmax \nbut had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax or the AUC of the active metabolite. These small changes are \nconsidered of minimal clinical significance; therefore, ticagrelor can be given with or without food. \nTicagrelor as well as the active metabolite are P-gp substrates.\n\nTicagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric \ntube into the stomach, has a comparable bioavailability to whole tablets with regards to AUC and \nCmax for ticagrelor and the active metabolite. Initial exposure (0.5 and 1 hour post-dose) from \ncrushed ticagrelor tablets mixed in water was higher compared to whole tablets, with a generally \nidentical concentration profile thereafter (2 to 48 hours).\n\nDistribution\nThe steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 87.5 l. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite\nis extensively bound to human plasma protein (>99.0%).\n\nBiotransformation\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of the active \nmetabolite and their interactions with other CYP3A substrates ranges from activation through to \ninhibition. \n\nThe major metabolite of ticagrelor is AR-C124910XX, which is also active as assessed by in vitro\nbinding to the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is \napproximately 30-40% of that obtained for ticagrelor.\n\n\n\n45\n\nElimination\nThe primary route of ticagrelor elimination is via hepatic metabolism. When radiolabelled \nticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (57.8% in \nfaeces, 26.5% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less \nthan 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the active metabolite is most likely via \nbiliary secretion. The mean t1/2 was approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 8.5 hours for the \nactive metabolite.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor (approximately 25% for both Cmax and AUC) and the active \nmetabolite were observed in elderly (\u226575years) ACS patients compared to younger patients by the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. These differences are not considered clinically significant \n(see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nTicagrelor has not been evaluated in a paediatric population (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nGender\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor and the active metabolite were observed in women compared to \nmen. These differences are not considered clinically significant.\n\nRenal impairment\nExposure to ticagrelor was approximately 20% lower and exposure to the active metabolite was \napproximately 17% higher in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n\nIn patients with end stage renal disease on haemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg \nadministered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was \nadministered immediately prior to dialysis (49% and 61%, respectively) showing that ticagrelor is \nnot dialysable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent (AUC 13-14% and \nCmax 17-36%). The inhibition of platelet (IPA) effect of  ticagrelor was independent of dialysis in \npatients with end stage renal disease and similar to subjects with normal renal function (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nCmax and AUC for ticagrelor were 12% and 23% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment \ncompared to matched healthy subjects, respectively, however, the IPA effect of ticagrelor was \nsimilar between the two groups. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment. Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and there is \nno pharmacokinetic information in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In patients that had \nmoderate or severe elevation in one or more liver function tests at baseline, ticagrelor plasma \nconcentrations were on average similar or slightly higher as compared to those without baseline \nelevations. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nEthnicity\nPatients of Asian descent have a 39% higher mean bioavailability compared to Caucasian patients. \nPatients self-identified as black had an 18% lower bioavailability of ticagrelor compared to \nCaucasian patients, in clinical pharmacology studies, the exposure (Cmax and AUC) to ticagrelor in \n\n\n\n46\n\nJapanese subjects was approximately 40% (20% after adjusting for body weight) higher compared \nto that in Caucasians. The exposure in patients self-identified as Hispanic or Latino was similar to \nthat in Caucasians.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPreclinical data for ticagrelor and its major metabolite have not demonstrated unacceptable risk for \nadverse effects for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxic potential.\n\nGastrointestinal irritation was observed in several animal species at clinical relevant exposure \nlevels (see section 4.8).\n\nIn female rats, ticagrelor at high dose showed an increased incidence of uterine tumours \n(adenocarcinomas) and an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas. The mechanism for uterine \ntumours is likely hormonal imbalance which can lead to tumours in rats. The mechanism for the \nhepatic adenomas is likely due to a rodent-specific enzyme induction in the liver. Thus, the \ncarcinogenicity findings are considered unlikely to be relevant for humans.\n\nIn rats, minor developmental anomalies were seen at a maternal toxic dose (safety margin of 5.1). \nIn rabbits, a slight delay in hepatic maturity and skeletal development was seen in foetuses from \ndams at high dose without showing maternal toxicity (safety margin of 4.5).\n\nStudies in rats and rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity, with slightly reduced maternal body \nweight gain and reduced neonatal viability and birth weight, with delayed growth. Ticagrelor \nproduced irregular cycles (mostly extended cycles) in female rats, but did not affect overall fertility \nin male and female rats. Pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled ticagrelor have \nshown that the parent compound and its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats (see \nsection 4.6).\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBrilique 90 mg orodispersible tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach orodispersible tablet contains 90 mg ticagrelor.\nBrilique contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOrodispersible tablet.\n\nRound, flat, bevelled edged, white to pale pink, orodispersible tablets marked with \u201890\u2019 above \u2018TI\u2019 \non one side and plain on the other.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBrilique, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \natherothrombotic events in adult patients with \n\n- acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or\n- a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic \n\nevent (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPatients taking Brilique should also take a daily low maintenance dose of ASA 75-150 mg, unless \nspecifically contraindicated.\n\nAcute coronary syndromes\nBrilique treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and \nthen continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Brilique 90 mg twice daily is recommended \nfor 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated (see section 5.1). \n\nHistory of myocardial infarction\nBrilique 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for \npatients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event (see \nsection 5.1). Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial \none-year treatment with Brilique 90 mg or other adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor \ntherapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be \ninitiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor \ninhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of \nextended treatment.\n\n\n\n49\n\nIf a switch is needed, the first dose of Brilique should be administered 24 hours following the last \ndose of the other antiplatelet medication.\n\nMissed dose\nLapses in therapy should also be avoided. A patient who misses a dose of Brilique should take only \none tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTicagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these \npatients is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). Only limited information is available in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor\nshould be used with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for patients \nwith mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in children below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \nFor oral use.\nBrilique can be administered with or without food.\nThe orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to Brilique 90 mg film-coated tablets for \npatients who have difficulty swallowing the tablets whole or for whom there is a preference for \norodispersible tablets. The tablet should be placed on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in \nsaliva. It can then be swallowed with or without water (see section 5.2). The tablet can also be \ndispersed in water and administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater). It is important to flush \nthe nasogastric tube through with water after administration of the mixture. A 60 mg orodispersible \ntablet is not available.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.8).\n\n\uf0b7 Active pathological bleeding.\n\uf0b7 History of intracranial haemorrhage (see section 4.8).\n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\uf0b7 Co-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, \n\nclarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and atazanavir), as co-administration may lead to a \nsubstantial increase in exposure to ticagrelor (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n50\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBleeding risk\nThe use of ticagrelor in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against \nthe benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). If \nclinically indicated, ticagrelor should be used with caution in the following patient groups:\n\n\uf0b7 Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation \ndisorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). The use of ticagrelor is contraindicated \nin patients with active pathological bleeding, in those with a history of intracranial \nhaemorrhage, and in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\n\uf0b7 Patients with concomitant administration of medicinal products that may increase the risk of \nbleeding (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral anticoagulants and/or \nfibrinolytics) within 24 hours of ticagrelor dosing.\n\nPlatelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is \nunlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding. Since co-administration of ticagrelor \nwith desmopressin did not decrease template-bleeding time, desmopressin is unlikely to be \neffective in managing clinical bleeding events (see section 4.5).\n\nAntifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa \ntherapy may increase haemostasis. Ticagrelor may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been \nidentified and controlled.\n\nSurgery\nPatients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking ticagrelor before \nany surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken.\n\nIn PLATO patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ticagrelor had more \nbleeding than clopidogrel when stopped within 1 day prior to surgery but a similar rate of major \nbleeds compared to clopidogrel after stopping therapy 2 or more days before surgery (see \nsection 4.8). If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is not desired, \nticagrelor should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery (see section 5.1).\n\nPatients with prior ischaemic stroke\nACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with ticagrelor for up to 12 months \n(PLATO study).\n\nIn PEGASUS, patients with history of MI with prior ischaemic stroke were not included. \nTherefore, in the absence of data, treatment beyond one year is not recommended in these patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nUse of ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.3). There is limited experience with ticagrelor in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, \ntherefore, caution is advised in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPatients at risk for bradycardic events\nHolter ECG monitoring has shown an increased frequency of mostly asymptomatic ventricular \npauses during treatment with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. Patients with an increased risk \nof bradycardic events (e.g. patients without a pacemaker who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd\n\ndegree AV block or bradycardic-related syncope) have been excluded from the main studies \nevaluating the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor. Therefore, due to the limited clinical experience, \nticagrelor should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n51\n\nIn addition, caution should be exercised when administering ticagrelor concomitantly with \nmedicinal products known to induce bradycardia. However, no evidence of clinically significant \nadverse reactions was observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or \nmore medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium \nchannel blockers diltiazem and verapamil and 4% digoxin) (see section 4.5).\n\nDuring the Holter substudy in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses >3 seconds with \nticagrelor than with clopidogrel during the acute phase of their ACS. The increase in \nHolter-detected ventricular pauses with ticagrelor was higher in patients with chronic heart failure \n(CHF) than in the overall study population during the acute phase of ACS, but not at one month \nwith ticagrelor or compared to clopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated \nwith this imbalance (including syncope or pacemaker insertion) in this patient population (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nDyspnoea\nDyspnoea was reported in patients treated with ticagrelor. Dyspnoea is usually mild to moderate in \nintensity and often resolves without need for treatment discontinuation. Patients with \nasthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of \nexperiencing dyspnoea with ticagrelor. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with \nhistory of asthma and/or COPD. The mechanism has not been elucidated. If a patient reports new, \nprolonged or worsened dyspnoea this should be investigated fully and if not tolerated, treatment \nwith ticagrelor should be stopped. For further details see section 4.8.\n\nCreatinine elevations\nCreatinine levels may increase during treatment with ticagrelor. The mechanism has not been \nelucidated. Renal function should be checked according to routine medical practice. In patients \nwith ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the \ntreatment with ticagrelor, paying special attention to patients \u226575 years, patients with \nmoderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin \nreceptor blocker (ARB).\n\nUric acid increase\nHyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with ticagrelor (see section 4.8). Caution is advised in \npatients with history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. As a precautionary measure, the use of \nticagrelor in patients with uric acid nephropathy is discouraged.\n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely with the use of \nticagrelor. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia \nassociated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever. TTP is a potentially fatal \ncondition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis.\n\nInterference with platelet function tests to diagnose heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)\nIn the heparin induced platelet activation (HIPA) test used to diagnose HIT, anti-platelet factor \n4/heparin antibodies in patient serum activate platelets of healthy donors in the presence of \nheparin.\nFalse negative results in a platelet function test (to include, but may not be limited to the HIPA \ntest) for HIT have been reported in patients administered ticagrelor. This is related to inhibition of \nthe P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the patient\u2019s \nsera/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of \nHIT platelet function tests. \n\n\n\n52\n\nIn patients who have developed HIT, the benefit-risk of continued treatment with ticagrelor should \nbe assessed, taking both the prothrombotic state of HIT and the increased risk of bleeding with \nconcomitant anticoagulant and ticagrelor treatment into consideration.\n\nOther\nBased on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance ASA dose and relative efficacy \nof ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of ticagrelor and high maintenance dose \nASA (>300 mg) is not recommended (see section 5.1).\n\nPremature discontinuation\nPremature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Brilique, could result in an \nincreased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI or stroke due to the patient\u2019s underlying disease. \nTherefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTicagrelor is primarily a CYP3A4 substrate and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Ticagrelor is also a \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and a weak P-gp inhibitor and may increase the exposure of P-gp \nsubstrates.\n\nEffects of medicinal and other products on ticagrelor\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors\n\uf0b7 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of ketoconazole with ticagrelor increased the \n\nticagrelor Cmax and AUC equal to 2.4-fold and 7.3-fold, respectively. The Cmax and AUC of \nthe active metabolite were reduced by 89% and 56%, respectively. Other strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and atazanavir) would be expected to have \nsimilar effects and therefore concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ticagrelor is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\n\uf0b7 Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of diltiazem with ticagrelor increased the \nticagrelor Cmax by 69% and AUC to 2.7-fold and decreased the active metabolite Cmax by \n38% and AUC was unchanged. There was no effect of ticagrelor on diltiazem plasma levels. \nOther moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, erythromycin and \nfluconazole) would be expected to have a similar effect and can as well be co-administered \nwith ticagrelor. \n\n\uf0b7 A 2-fold increase of ticagrelor exposure was observed after daily consumption of large \nquantities of grapefruit juice (3x200 ml). This magnitude of increased exposure is not \nexpected to be clinically relevant to most patients.\n\nCYP3A inducers\nCo-administration of rifampicin with ticagrelor decreased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC by 73% and \n86%, respectively. The Cmax of the active metabolite was unchanged and the AUC was decreased \nby 46%, respectively. Other CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) \nwould be expected to decrease the exposure to ticagrelor as well. Co-administration of ticagrelor \nwith potent CYP3A inducers may decrease exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor, therefore, their \nconcomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged.\n\nCyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor)\nCo-administration of cyclosporine (600 mg) with ticagrelor increased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC \nequal to 2.3-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. The AUC of the active metabolite was increased by \n32% and Cmax was decreased by 15% in the presence of cyclosporine. \n\n\n\n53\n\nNo data are available on concomitant use of ticagrelor with other active substances that also are \npotent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may \nincrease ticagrelor exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be \nmade with caution.\n\nOthers\nClinical pharmacology interaction studies showed that co-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, \nenoxaparin and ASA or desmopressin did not have any effect on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor \nor the active metabolite or on ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with ticagrelor alone. If \nclinically indicated, medicinal products that alter haemostasis should be used with caution in \ncombination with ticagrelor.\n\nA delayed and decreased exposure to oral P2Y12 inhibitors, including ticagrelor and its active \n\nmetabolite, has been observed in patients with ACS treated with morphine (35% reduction in \n\nticagrelor exposure). This interaction may be related to reduced gastrointestinal motility and apply \n\nto other opioids. The clinical relevance is unknown, but data indicate the potential for reduced \n\nticagrelor efficacy in patients co-administered ticagrelor and morphine. In patients with ACS, in \n\nwhom morphine cannot be withheld and fast P2Y12 inhibition is deemed crucial, the use of a \n\nparenteral P2Y12 inhibitor may be considered.\n\nEffects of ticagrelor on other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4\n\uf0b7 Simvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of ticagrelor with simvastatin increased simvastatin Cmax by \n\n81% and AUC by 56% and increased simvastatin acid Cmax by 64% and AUC by 52% with \nsome individual increases equal to 2- to 3-fold. Co-administration of ticagrelor with doses of \nsimvastatin exceeding 40 mg daily could cause adverse reactions of simvastatin and should \nbe weighed against potential benefits. There was no effect of simvastatin on ticagrelor \nplasma levels. Ticagrelor may have similar effect on lovastatin. The concomitant use of \nticagrelor with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended.\n\n\uf0b7 Atorvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of atorvastatin and ticagrelor increased atorvastatin acid \nCmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all \natorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant.\n\n\uf0b7 A similar effect on other statins metabolised by CYP3A4 cannot be excluded. Patients in \nPLATO receiving ticagrelor took a variety of statins, with no concern of an association with \nstatin safety among the 93% of the PLATO cohort taking these medicinal products. \n\nTicagrelor is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of ticagrelor and CYP3A4 substrates \nwith narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as ticagrelor \nmay increase the exposure to these medicinal products.\n\nP-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine) \nConcomitant administration of ticagrelor increased the digoxin Cmax by 75% and AUC by 28%. \nThe mean trough digoxin levels were increased about 30% with ticagrelor co-administration with \nsome individual maximum increases to 2-fold. In the presence of digoxin, the Cmax and AUC of \nticagrelor and its active metabolite were not affected. Therefore, appropriate clinical and/or \nlaboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent \nmedicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with ticagrelor.\n\nThere was no effect of ticagrelor on cyclosporine blood levels. Effect of ticagrelor on other P-gp \nsubstrates has not been studied.\n\n\n\n54\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of \neither medicinal product, which suggests that ticagrelor is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to \nalter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide.\n\nOral contraceptives\nCo-administration of ticagrelor and levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol increased ethinyl estradiol \nexposure approximately 20% but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel. No \nclinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl \nestradiol are co-administered with ticagrelor.\n\nMedicinal products known to induce bradycardia\nDue to observations of mostly asymptomatic ventricular pauses and bradycardia, caution should be \nexercised when administering ticagrelor concomitantly with medicinal products known to induce \nbradycardia (see section 4.4). However, no evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions was \nobserved in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products \nknown to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and \nverapamil and 4% digoxin).\n\nOther concomitant therapy\nIn clinical studies, ticagrelor was commonly administered with ASA, proton pump inhibitors, \nstatins, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor \nblockers as needed for concomitant conditions for long-term and also heparin, low molecular \nweight heparin and intravenous GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors for short durations (see section 5.1). No \nevidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products was observed.\n\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin had no effect on \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated coagulation time (ACT) or factor Xa \nassays. However, due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with \nthe concomitant administration of ticagrelor with medicinal products known to alter haemostasis.\n\nDue to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and \ncitalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with ticagrelor as this may increase the \nrisk of bleeding.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid \npregnancy during ticagrelor therapy.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ticagrelor in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ticagrelor is not recommended during \npregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and \nits active metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A \ndecision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nticagrelor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\n\n\n55\n\nFertility\nTicagrelor had no effect on male or female fertility in animals (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTicagrelor has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. During treatment \nwith ticagrelor, dizziness and confusion have been reported. Therefore, patients who experience \nthese symptoms should be cautious while driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of ticagrelor has been evaluated in two large phase 3 outcome trials (PLATO and \nPEGASUS) including more than 39,000 patients (see section 5.1).\n\nIn PLATO, patients on ticagrelor had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events \nthan clopidogrel (7.4% vs. 5.4%). In PEGASUS, patients on ticagrelor had a higher incidence of \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events compared to ASA therapy alone (16.1% for ticagrelor 60 mg \nwith ASA vs. 8.5% for ASA therapy alone). The most commonly reported adverse reactions in \npatients treated with ticagrelor were bleeding and dyspnoea (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified following studies or have been reported in\npost-marketing experience with ticagrelor (Table 1). \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Within each SOC the \nadverse reactions are ranked by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined according to \nthe following conventions: Very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to \uf03c1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \uf03c1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Adverse reactions by frequency and system organ class (SOC)\n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps)\n\nTumour \nbleedingsa\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nBlood disorder \nbleedingsb\n\nThrombotic \nThrombocytopenic \nPurpurac\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity \nincluding \nangioedemac\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nHyperuricaemiad Gout/Gouty \n\nArthritis\n\n\n\n56\n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nConfusion\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nDizziness,\nSyncope, \nHeadache\n\nIntracranial \nhaemorrhage \n\nEye disorders Eye \nhaemorrhagee\n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders\n\nVertigo Ear haemorrhage\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nHypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea Respiratory \nsystem \nbleedingsf\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhageg, \nDiarrhoea, \nNausea, \nDyspepsia, \nConstipation\n\nRetroperitoneal \nhaemorrhage\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nSubcutaneous or \ndermal \nbleedingh, Rash, \nPruritus \n\nMusculoskeletal \nconnective tissue \nand bone\n\nMuscular \nbleedingsi\n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nUrinary tract \nbleedingj\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders\n\nReproductive \nsystem \nbleedingsk\n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine \nincreasedd\n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications\n\nPost procedural \nhaemorrhage, \nTraumatic \nbleedingsl\n\na e.g. bleeding from bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer\nb e.g. increased tendency to bruise, spontaneous haematoma, haemorrhagic diathesis\nc Identified in post-marketing experience\nd Frequencies derived from lab observations (Uric acid increases to >upper limit of normal from baseline below or within \nreference range.

However, \nmore PLATO combined Major + Minor bleeding occurred with ticagrelor compared with \nclopidogrel. Few patients in PLATO had fatal bleeds: 20 (0.2%) for ticagrelor and 23 (0.3%) for \nclopidogrel (see section 4.4).\n\nAge, sex, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy and medical \nhistory, including a previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, all did not predict either overall \nor non-procedural PLATO Major bleeding. Thus, no particular group was identified at risk for any \nsubset of bleeding.\n\nCABG-related bleeding:\nIn PLATO, 42% of the 1584 patients (12% of cohort) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft \n(CABG) surgery had a PLATO Major Fatal/Life-threatening bleeding with no difference between \ntreatment groups. Fatal CABG bleeding occurred in 6 patients in each treatment group (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nNon-CABG related bleeding and non-procedural related bleeding:\n\n\n\n58\n\nTicagrelor and clopidogrel did not differ in non-CABG PLATO-defined Major Fatal/Life-\nthreatening bleeding, but PLATO-defined Total Major, TIMI Major, and TIMI Major + Minor \nbleeding were more common with ticagrelor. Similarly, when removing all procedure related \nbleeds, more bleeding occurred with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel (Table 2). Discontinuation of \ntreatment due to non-procedural bleeding was more common for ticagrelor (2.9%) than for \nclopidogrel (1.2%; p<0.001).\n\nIntracranial bleeding:\nThere were more intracranial non-procedural bleeds with ticagrelor (n=27 bleeds in 26 patients, \n0.3%) than with clopidogrel (n=14 bleeds, 0.2%), of which 11 bleeds with ticagrelor and 1 with \nclopidogrel were fatal. There was no difference in overall fatal bleeds.\n\nBleeding findings in PEGASUS\nOverall outcome of bleeding events in the PEGASUS study are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Analysis of overall bleeding events, Kaplan-Meier estimates at 36 months \n(PEGASUS)\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice \n\ndaily + ASA\n\nN=6958\n\nASA alone\n\nN=6996\n\nSafety Endpoints KM%\n\nHazard \nRatio\n\n(95% CI)\n\nKM% p-value\n\nTIMI-defined bleeding categories\n\nTIMI    Major\n2.3 2.32\n\n(1.68, 3.21)\n\n1.1 <0.0001\n\nFatal\n0.3 1.00\n\n(0.44, 2.27)\n\n0.3 1.0000\n\nICH\n0.6 1.33\n\n(0.77, 2.31)\n\n0.5 0.3130\n\nOther TIMI Major\n1.6 3.61\n\n(2.31, 5.65)\n\n0.5 <0.0001\n\nTIMI Major or Minor\n3.4 2.54\n\n(1.93, 3.35)\n\n1.4 <0.0001\n\nTIMI Major or Minor or Requiring \n\nmedical attention\n\n16.6 2.64\n\n(2.35, 2.97)\n\n7.0 <0.0001\n\nPLATO-defined bleeding categories\n\nPLATO Major\n3.5 2.57\n\n(1.95, 3.37)\n\n1.4 <0.0001\n\nFatal/Life-threatening\n2.4 2.38\n\n(1.73, 3.26)\n\n1.1 <0.0001\n\nOther PLATO Major\n1.1 3.37\n\n(1.95, 5.83)\n\n0.3 <0.0001\n\nPLATO Major or Minor\n15.2 2.71\n\n(2.40, 3.08)\n\n6.2 <0.0001\n\nBleeding category definitions:\n\nTIMI Major: Fatal bleeding, OR any intracranial bleeding, OR clinically overt signs of haemorrhage associated with a \n\ndrop in haemoglobin (Hgb) of \u226550 g/L, or when Hgb is not available, a fall in haematocrit (Hct) of 15%.\n\n\n\n59\n\nFatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days.\n\nICH: Intracranial haemorrhage.\n\nOther TIMI Major: Non-fatal non-ICH TIMI Major bleeding.\n\nTIMI Minor: Clinically apparent with 30-50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin.\n\nTIMI Requiring medical attention: Requiring intervention, OR leading to hospitalisation, OR prompting evaluation.\n\nPLATO Major Fatal/life-threatening: Fatal bleeding, OR any intracranial bleeding, OR intrapericardial with cardiac \n\ntamponade, OR with hypovolaemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors/inotropes or surgery OR clinically \n\napparent with >50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin or \u22654 red cell units transfused.\n\nPLATO Major Other: Significantly disabling, OR clinically apparent with 30-50 g/L decrease in haemoglobin, OR \n\n2-3 red cell units transfused.\n\nPLATO Minor: Requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding.\n\nIn PEGASUS, TIMI Major bleeding for ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was higher than for ASA \nalone. No increased bleeding risk was seen for fatal bleeding and only a minor increase was \nobserved in intracranial haemorrhages, as compared to ASA therapy alone. There were few fatal \nbleeding events in the study, 11 (0.3%) for ticagrelor 60 mg and 12 (0.3%) for ASA therapy alone. \nThe observed increased risk of TIMI Major bleeding with ticagrelor 60 mg was primarily due to a \nhigher frequency of Other TIMI Major bleedings driven by events in the gastrointestinal SOC.\n\nIncreased bleeding patterns similar to TIMI Major were seen for TIMI Major or Minor and \nPLATO Major and PLATO Major or Minor bleeding categories (see Table 3). Discontinuation of \ntreatment due to bleeding was more common with ticagrelor 60 mg compared to ASA therapy \nalone (6.2% and 1.5%, respectively). The majority of these bleedings were of less severity \n(classified as TIMI Requiring medical attention), e.g. epistaxis, bruising and haematomas.\n\nThe bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups \n(e.g. by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy \nand medical history) for TIMI Major, TIMI Major or Minor and PLATO Major bleeding events.\n\nIntracranial bleeding:\nSpontaneous ICHs were reported in similar rates for ticagrelor 60 mg and ASA therapy alone\n(n=13, 0.2% in both treatment groups). Traumatic and procedural ICHs showed a minor increase \nwith ticagrelor 60 mg treatment, (n=15, 0.2%) compared with ASA therapy alone (n=10, 0.1%). \nThere were 6 fatal ICHs with ticagrelor 60 mg and 5 fatal ICHs with ASA therapy alone. The \nincidence of intracranial bleeding was low in both treatment groups given the significant \ncomorbidity and CV risk factors of the population under study.\n\nDyspnoea\nDyspnoea, a sensation of breathlessness, is reported by patients treated with ticagrelor. In PLATO, \ndyspnoea adverse events (AEs) (dyspnoea, dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea exertional, dyspnoea \nparoxysmal nocturnal and nocturnal dyspnoea), when combined, was reported by 13.8% of patients \ntreated with ticagrelor and by 7.8% of patients treated with clopidogrel. In 2.2% of patients taking \nticagrelor and by 0.6% taking clopidogrel investigators considered the dyspnoea causally related to \ntreatment in the PLATO study and few were serious (0.14% ticagrelor; 0.02% clopidogrel), (see \nsection 4.4). Most reported symptoms of dyspnoea were mild to moderate in intensity, and most \nwere reported as a single episode early after starting treatment.\n\nCompared with clopidogrel, patients with asthma/COPD treated with ticagrelor may have an \nincreased risk of experiencing non-serious dyspnoea (3.29% ticagrelor versus 0.53% clopidogrel) \nand serious dyspnoea (0.38% ticagrelor versus 0.00% clopidogrel). In absolute terms, this risk was \nhigher than in the overall PLATO population. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients \nwith history of asthma and/or COPD (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n60\n\nAbout 30% of episodes resolved within 7 days. PLATO included patients with baseline congestive \nheart failure, COPD or asthma; these patients, and the elderly, were more likely to report dyspnoea.\nFor ticagrelor, 0.9% of patients discontinued study drug because of dyspnoea compared with \n0.1% taking clopidogrel. The higher incidence of dyspnoea with ticagrelor is not associated with \nnew or worsening heart or lung disease (see section 4.4). Ticagrelor does not affect tests of \npulmonary function.\n\nIn PEGASUS, dyspnoea was reported in 14.2% of patients taking ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily and \nin 5.5% of patients taking ASA alone. As in PLATO, most reported dyspnoea was mild to \nmoderate in intensity (see section 4.4). Patients who reported dyspnoea tended to be older and \nmore frequently had dyspnoea, COPD or asthma at baseline.\n\nInvestigations\nUric acid elevations: In PLATO, serum uric acid increased to more than upper limit of normal in \n22% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 13% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The \ncorresponding numbers in PEGASUS were 9.1%, 8.8% and 5.5% for ticagrelor 90 mg, 60 mg and \nplacebo, respectively. Mean serum uric acid increased approximately 15% with ticagrelor \ncompared to approximately 7.5% with clopidogrel and after treatment was stopped, decreased to \napproximately 7% on ticagrelor but with no decrease observed for clopidogrel. In PEGASUS, a \nreversible increase in mean serum uric acid levels of 6.3% and 5.6% was found for ticagrelor \n90 mg and 60 mg, respectively, compared to a 1.5% decrease in the placebo group. In PLATO, the \nfrequency of gouty arthritis was 0.2% for ticagrelor vs. 0.1% for clopidogrel. The corresponding \nnumbers for gout/gouty arthritis in PEGASUS were 1.6%, 1.5% and 1.1% for ticagrelor 90 mg, \n60 mg and placebo, respectively.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nTicagrelor is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was \ndose-limiting in a single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions \nwhich may occur with overdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses (see section 4.8).\n\nIn the event of an overdose, the above potential adverse reactions could occur and ECG monitoring \nshould be considered.\n\nThere is currently no known antidote to reverse the effects of ticagrelor, and ticagrelor is not \ndialysable (see section 5.2). Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. \nThe expected effect of excessive ticagrelor dosing is prolonged duration of bleeding risk associated \nwith platelet inhibition. Platelet transfusion is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with \nbleeding (see section 4.4). If bleeding occurs other appropriate supportive measures should be \ntaken.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n61\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, ATC code: \nB01AC24\n\nMechanism of action\nBrilique contains ticagrelor, a member of the chemical class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines \n(CPTP), which is an oral, direct acting, selective and reversibly binding P2Y12 receptor antagonist \nthat prevents ADP-mediated P2Y12 dependent platelet activation and aggregation. Ticagrelor does \nnot prevent ADP binding but when bound to the P2Y12 receptor prevents ADP-induced signal \ntransduction. Since platelets participate in the initiation and/or evolution of thrombotic \ncomplications of atherosclerotic disease, inhibition of platelet function has been shown to reduce \nthe risk of CV events such as death, MI or stroke.\n\nTicagrelor also increases local endogenous adenosine levels by inhibiting the equilibrative \nnucleoside transporter-1 (ENT-1). \n\nTicagrelor has been documented to augment the following adenosine-induced effects in healthy \nsubjects and in patients with ACS: vasodilation (measured by coronary blood flow increases in \nhealthy volunteers and ACS patients; headache), inhibition of platelet function (in human whole \nblood in vitro) and dyspnoea. However, a link between the observed increases in adenosine and \nclinical outcomes (e.g. morbidity-mortality) has not been clearly elucidated.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nOnset of action\nIn patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ASA, ticagrelor demonstrates a rapid \nonset of pharmacological effect as demonstrated by a mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) \nfor ticagrelor at 0.5 hours after 180 mg loading dose of about 41%, with the maximum IPA effect \nof 89% by 2-4 hours post dose, and maintained between 2-8 hours. 90% of patients had final extent \nIPA>70% by 2 hours post dose.\n\nOffset of action\nIf a CABG procedure is planned, ticagrelor bleeding risk is increased compared to clopidogrel \nwhen discontinued within less than 96 hours prior to procedure.\n\nSwitching data\nSwitching from clopidogrel 75 mg to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily results in an absolute IPA \nincrease of 26.4% and switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel results in an absolute IPA decrease \nof 24.5%. Patients can be switched from clopidogrel to ticagrelor without any interruption of \nantiplatelet effect (see section 4.2).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor is derived from two phase 3 trials:\n\n\uf0b7 The PLATO [PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes] study, a comparison of ticagrelor \nto clopidogrel, both given in combination with ASA and other standard therapy.\n\n\uf0b7 The PEGASUS TIMI-54 [PrEvention with TicaGrelor of SecondAry Thrombotic Events in \nHigh-RiSk AcUte Coronary Syndrome Patients] study, a comparison of ticagrelor combined \nwith ASA to ASA therapy alone.\n\nPLATO study (Acute Coronary Syndromes)\n\nThe PLATO study included 18,624 patients who presented within 24 hours of onset of symptoms \nof unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST elevation \n\n\n\n62\n\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI), and were initially managed medically, or with percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI), or with CABG.\n\nClinical efficacy\nOn a background of daily ASA, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily showed superiority to 75 mg daily \nclopidogrel in preventing the composite endpoint of CV death, MI or stroke, with the difference \ndriven by CV death and MI. Patients received a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg \npossible if having PCI) or 180 mg of ticagrelor.\n\nThe result appeared early (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0.6% and relative risk reduction [RRR] \nof 12% at 30 days), with a constant treatment effect over the entire 12-month period, yielding ARR \n1.9% per year with RRR of 16%. This suggests it is appropriate to treat patients with ticagrelor 90 \nmg twice daily for 12 months (see section 4.2). Treating 54 ACS patients with ticagrelor instead of \nclopidogrel will prevent 1 atherothrombotic event; treating 91 will prevent 1 CV death (see \nFigure 1 and Table 4).\n\nThe treatment effect of ticagrelor over clopidogrel appears consistent across many subgroups, \nincluding weight; sex; medical history of diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attack or \nnon-haemorrhagic stroke, or revascularisation; concomitant therapies including heparins, \nGpIIb/IIIa inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors (see section 4.5); final index event diagnosis \n(STEMI, NSTEMI or UA); and treatment pathway intended at randomisation (invasive or \nmedical).\n\nA weakly significant treatment interaction was observed with region whereby the hazard ratio \n(HR) for the primary endpoint favours ticagrelor in the rest of world but favours clopidogrel in \nNorth America, which represented approximately 10% of the overall population studied \n(interaction p-value=0.045). Exploratory analyses suggest a possible association with ASA dose \nsuch that reduced efficacy was observed with ticagrelor with increasing ASA doses. Chronic daily \nASA doses to accompany ticagrelor should be 75-150 mg (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nFigure 1 shows the estimate of the risk to the first occurrence of any event in the composite efficacy \nendpoint.\n\n\n\n63\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Analysis of primary clinical composite endpoint of CV death, MI and stroke \n(PLATO)\n\nTicagrelor reduced the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint compared to clopidogrel in \nboth the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI population (Table 4). Thus, Brilique 90 mg twice daily together \nwith low-dose ASA can be used in patients with ACS (unstable angina, non-ST elevation \nMyocardial Infarction [NSTEMI] or ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]); including \npatients managed medically, and those who are managed with percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG).\n\nTable 4 - Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PLATO)\n\nTicagrelor\n90 mg\n\ntwice daily\n(% patients \nwith event)\n\nN=9333\n\nClopidogrel \n75 mg \n\nonce daily\n(% patients \nwith event)\n\nN=9291\n\nARRa\n\n(%/yr)\nRRRa (%)\n(95% CI)\n\np-value\n\nCV death, MI (excl. \nsilent MI) or stroke\n\n9.3 10.9 1.9 16 (8, 23) 0.0003\n\nInvasive intent 8.5 10.0 1.7 16 (6, 25) 0.0025\n\nMedical intent 11.3 13.2 2.3 15 (0.3, 27) 0.0444d\n\nCV death 3.8 4.8 1.1 21 (9, 31) 0.0013\n\nMI (excl. silent MI)b 5.4 6.4 1.1 16 (5, 25) 0.0045\n\nStroke 1.3 1.1 -0.2 -17 (-52, 9) 0.2249\n\nAll-cause mortality, \nMI (excl. silent MI) \nor stroke\n\n9.7 11.5 2.1 16 (8, 23) 0.0001\n\n\n\n64\n\nCV death, total MI, \nstroke, SRI, RI, TIA \nor other ATEc\n\n13.8 15.7 2.1 12 (5, 19) 0.0006\n\nAll-cause mortality 4.3 5.4 1.4 22 (11, 31) 0.0003d\n\nDefinite stent \nthrombosis\n\n1.2 1.7 0.6 32 (8, 49) 0.0123d\n\na ARR = absolute risk reduction; RRR = relative risk reduction = (1-Hazard ratio) x 100%.

The superiority of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in reducing \nmajor CV events was not significantly affected by patient CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Similar \nto the overall PLATO study, total PLATO Major bleeding did not differ between ticagrelor and \nclopidogrel, regardless of CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Non-CABG PLATO Major bleeding \nwas increased with ticagrelor compared clopidogrel in patients with one or more CYP2C19 loss of \nfunction alleles, but similar to clopidogrel in patients with no loss of function allele.\n\nCombined efficacy and safety composite\nA combined efficacy and safety composite (CV death, MI, stroke, or PLATO-defined \u2018Total \nMajor\u2019 bleeding) indicates that the benefit in efficacy of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel is not \noffset by the major bleeding events (ARR 1.4%, RRR 8%, HR 0.92; p=0.0257) over 12 months \nafter ACS.\n\nClinical safety\n\nHolter substudy:\nTo study the occurrence of ventricular pauses and other arrhythmic episodes during PLATO,\ninvestigators performed Holter monitoring in a subset of nearly 3000 patients, of whom \napproximately 2000 had recordings both in the acute phase of their ACS and after one month. The \nprimary variable of interest was the occurrence of ventricular pauses \u22653 seconds. More patients had \nventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; and \n2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month (see section 4.4). The increase in ventricular pauses in \nthe acute phase of ACS was more pronounced in ticagrelor patients with history of CHF (9.2% \nversus 5.4% in patients without CHF history; for clopidogrel patients, 4.0% in those with versus \n3.6% in those without CHF history). This imbalance did not occur at one month: 2.0% versus 2.1% \nfor ticagrelor patients with and without CHF history, respectively; and 3.8% versus 1.4% with \nclopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated with this imbalance \n(including pacemaker insertions) in this population of patients.\n\nPEGASUS study (History of Myocardial Infarction)\n\nThe PEGASUS TIMI-54 study was a 21,162 patient, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, parallel group, international multicentre study to assess the prevention of \natherothrombotic events with ticagrelor given at 2 doses (either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice \ndaily) combined with low dose ASA (75-150 mg), compared to ASA therapy alone in patients with \nhistory of MI and additional risk factors for atherothrombosis.\n\n\n\n65\n\nPatients were eligible to participate if they were aged 50 years or over, with a history of MI (1 to \n3 years prior to randomisation), and had at least one of the following risk factors for \natherothrombosis: age \u226565 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, a second prior MI, \nevidence of multivessel CAD or chronic non-end-stage renal dysfunction.\n\nPatients were ineligible if there was planned use of a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, dipyridamole, \ncilostazol, or anticoagulant therapy during the study period; if they had a bleeding disorder or a \nhistory of an ischaemic stroke or intracranial bleeding, a central nervous system tumour or an \nintracranial vascular abnormality; if they had had gastrointestinal bleeding within the previous \n6 months or major surgery within the previous 30 days.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nFigure 2 - Analysis of primary clinical composite endpoint of CV death, MI and stroke \n(PEGASUS)\n\nTable 5 - Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PEGASUS)\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice daily +ASA\nN = 7045\n\nASA alone\nN = 7067\n\np-value\n\nCharacteristic\nPatients \n\nwith events\nKM %\n\nHR\n(95% CI)\n\nPatients with \nevents\n\nKM %\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\n\n\n66\n\nTicagrelor 60 mg twice daily +ASA\nN = 7045\n\nASA alone\nN = 7067\n\np-value\n\nCharacteristic\nPatients \n\nwith events\nKM %\n\nHR\n(95% CI)\n\nPatients with \nevents\n\nKM %\n\nComposite of CV \nDeath/MI/Stroke\n\n487 (6.9%) 7.8%\n0.84 \n\n(0.74, 0.95)\n578 (8.2%) 9.0% 0.0043 (s)\n\nCV death 174 (2.5%) 2.9%\n0.83 \n\n(0.68, 1.01)\n210 (3.0%) 3.4% 0.0676\n\nMI 285 (4.0%) 4.5%\n0.84 \n\n(0.72, 0.98)\n338 (4.8%) 5.2% 0.0314\n\nStroke 91 (1.3%) 1.5%\n0.75 \n\n(0.57, 0.98)\n122 (1.7%) 1.9% 0.0337\n\nSecondary endpoint\n\nCV death 174 (2.5%) 2.9%\n0.83 \n\n(0.68, 1.01)\n210 (3.0%) 3.4% -\n\nAll-cause \nmortality\n\n289 (4.1%) 4.7%\n0.89\n\n(0.76, 1.04)\n326 (4.6%) 5.2% -\n\nHazard ratio and p-values are calculated separately for ticagrelor vs. ASA therapy alone from Cox proportional hazards \n\nmodel with treatment group as the only explanatory variable.\n\nKM percentage calculated at 36 months.\n\nNote: the number of first events for the components CV death, MI and stroke are the actual number of first events for \n\neach component and do not add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint\n\n(s) Indicates statistical significance.\n\nCI = Confidence interval; CV = Cardiovascular; HR = Hazard ratio; KM = Kaplan-Meier; MI = Myocardial infarction; \n\nN = Number of patients.\n\nBoth 60 mg twice daily and 90 mg twice daily regimens of ticagrelor in combination with ASA\nwere superior to ASA alone in the prevention of atherothrombotic events (composite endpoint: CV \ndeath, MI and stroke), with a consistent treatment effect over the entire study period, yielding a \n16% RRR and 1.27% ARR for ticagrelor 60 mg and a 15% RRR and 1.19% ARR for ticagrelor \n90 mg.\n\nAlthough the efficacy profile of 90 mg and 60 mg were similar, there is evidence that the lower \ndose has a better tolerability and safety profile in relation to risk of the bleeding and dyspnoea. \nTherefore, only Brilique 60 mg twice daily co-administered with ASA is recommended for the \nprevention atherothrombotic events (CV death, MI and stroke) in patients with a history of MI and \na high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.\n\nRelative to ASA alone, ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced the primary composite \nendpoint of CV death, MI and stroke. Each of the components contributed to the reduction in the \nprimary composite endpoint (CV death 17% RRR, MI 16% RRR and stroke 25% RRR).\n\nThe RRR for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and \nonwards (16% RRR) was similar. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor \nbeyond 3 years of extended treatment.\n\nThere was no evidence of benefit (no reduction in the primary composite endpoint of CV death, MI \nand stroke, but an increase in major bleeding) when ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was introduced in \n\n\n\n67\n\nclinically stable patients >2 years from the MI, or more than one year after stopping previous ADP \nreceptor inhibitor treatment (see also section 4.2).\n\nClinical safety\nThe rate of discontinuations with ticagrelor 60 mg due to bleeding and dyspnoea was higher in \npatients >75 years (42%) than in younger patients (range: 23-31%), with a difference versus \nplacebo higher than 10% (42% vs. 29%) in patients >75 years.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBrilique in all subsets of the paediatric population in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and history \nof myocardial infarction (MI) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nTicagrelor demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics and exposure to ticagrelor and the active \nmetabolite (AR-C124910XX) are approximately dose proportional up to 1260 mg.\n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of ticagrelor is rapid with a median tmax of approximately 1.5 hours. The formation of \nthe major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (also active) from ticagrelor is rapid with a \nmedian tmax of approximately 2.5 hours. Following an oral ticagrelor 90 mg single dose under \nfasted conditions in healthy subjects, Cmax is 529 ng/ml and AUC is 3451 ng*h/ml. The metabolite \nparent ratios are 0.28 for Cmax and 0.42 for AUC. The pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and \nAR-C124910XX in patients with a history of MI were generally similar to that in the ACS \npopulation. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the PEGASUS study the median \nticagrelor Cmax was 391 ng/ml and AUC was 3801 ng*h/ml at steady state for ticagrelor 60 mg. For \nticagrelor 90 mg Cmax was 627 ng/ml and AUC was 6255 ng*h/ml at steady state.\n\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was estimated to be 36%. Ingestion of a high-fat \nmeal resulted in a 21% increase in ticagrelor AUC and 22% decrease in the active metabolite Cmax \nbut had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax or the AUC of the active metabolite. These small changes are \nconsidered of minimal clinical significance; therefore, ticagrelor can be given with or without food. \nTicagrelor as well as the active metabolite are P-gp substrates.\n\nTicagrelor orodispersible tablets, dispersed in saliva and swallowed without water or suspended in \nwater and administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, were bioequivalent to \nfilm-coated whole tablets (AUC and Cmax within 80-125% for ticagrelor and the active metabolite). \nWhen the orodispersible tablet was dispersed in saliva and swallowed with water, ticagrelor AUC \nwas similar, while Cmax was about 15% lower than for the film-coated tablet. The small difference \nin Cmax noted is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\nDistribution\nThe steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 87.5 l. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite\nis extensively bound to human plasma protein (>99.0%).\n\nBiotransformation\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of the active \nmetabolite and their interactions with other CYP3A substrates ranges from activation through to \ninhibition. \n\n\n\n68\n\nThe major metabolite of ticagrelor is AR-C124910XX, which is also active as assessed by in vitro\nbinding to the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is \napproximately 30-40% of that obtained for ticagrelor.\n\nElimination\nThe primary route of ticagrelor elimination is via hepatic metabolism. When radiolabelled \nticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (57.8% in \nfaeces, 26.5% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less \nthan 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the active metabolite is most likely via \nbiliary secretion. The mean t1/2 was approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 8.5 hours for the \nactive metabolite.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor (approximately 25% for both Cmax and AUC) and the active \nmetabolite were observed in elderly (\u226575 years) ACS patients compared to younger patients by the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. These differences are not considered clinically significant \n(see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nTicagrelor has not been evaluated in a paediatric population (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nGender\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor and the active metabolite were observed in women compared to \nmen. These differences are not considered clinically significant.\n\nRenal impairment\nExposure to ticagrelor was approximately 20% lower and exposure to the active metabolite was \napproximately 17% higher in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n\nIn patients with end stage renal disease on haemodialysis AUC and Cmax of ticagrelor 90 mg \nadministered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when ticagrelor was \nadministered immediately prior to dialysis (49% and 61%, respectively) showing that ticagrelor is \nnot dialysable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent (AUC 13-14% and \nCmax 17-36%). The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) effect of ticagrelor was independent of \ndialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to subjects with normal renal function \n(see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nCmax and AUC for ticagrelor were 12% and 23% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment \ncompared to matched healthy subjects, respectively, however, the IPA effect of ticagrelor was \nsimilar between the two groups. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment. Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and there is \nno pharmacokinetic information in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In patients that had \nmoderate or severe elevation in one or more liver function tests at baseline, ticagrelor plasma \nconcentrations were on average similar or slightly higher as compared to those without baseline \nelevations. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n69\n\nEthnicity\nPatients of Asian descent have a 39% higher mean bioavailability compared to Caucasian patients. \nPatients self-identified as black had an 18% lower bioavailability of ticagrelor compared to \nCaucasian patients, in clinical pharmacology studies, the exposure (Cmax and AUC) to ticagrelor in \nJapanese subjects was approximately 40% (20% after adjusting for body weight) higher compared \nto that in Caucasians. The exposure in patients self-identified as Hispanic or Latino was similar to \nthat in Caucasians.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPreclinical data for ticagrelor and its major metabolite have not demonstrated unacceptable risk for \nadverse effects for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxic potential.\n\nGastrointestinal irritation was observed in several animal species at clinical relevant exposure \nlevels (see section 4.8).\n\nIn female rats, ticagrelor at high dose showed an increased incidence of uterine tumours \n(adenocarcinomas) and an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas. The mechanism for uterine \ntumours is likely hormonal imbalance which can lead to tumours in rats. The mechanism for the \nhepatic adenomas is likely due to a rodent-specific enzyme induction in the liver. Thus, the \ncarcinogenicity findings are considered unlikely to be relevant for humans.\n\nIn rats, minor developmental anomalies were seen at a maternal toxic dose (safety margin of 5.1). \nIn rabbits a slight delay in hepatic maturity and skeletal development was seen in foetuses from \ndams at high dose without showing maternal toxicity (safety margin of 4.5).\n\nStudies in rats and rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity, with slightly reduced maternal body \nweight gain and reduced neonatal viability and birth weight, with delayed growth. Ticagrelor \nproduced irregular cycles (mostly extended cycles) in female rats, but did not affect overall fertility \nin male and female rats. Pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled ticagrelor have \nshown that the parent compound and its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats (see \nsection 4.6).\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n90\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nBrilique 60 mg film-coated tablets\nticagrelor\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Brilique is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Brilique\n3. How to take Brilique\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Brilique\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Brilique is and what it is used for \n\nWhat Brilique is\nBrilique contains an active substance called ticagrelor. This belongs to a group of medicines called \nantiplatelet medicines.\n\nWhat Brilique is used for\nBrilique in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (another antiplatelet agent) is to be used in adults \nonly. You have been given this medicine because you have had:\n\n\uf0b7 a heart attack, over a year ago.\nIt reduces the chances of you having another heart attack, stroke or dying from a disease related to \nyour heart or blood vessels.\n\nHow Brilique works\nBrilique affects cells called \u2018platelets\u2019 (also called thrombocytes). These very small blood cells \nhelp stop bleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or \ndamaged. \n\nHowever, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. This can \nbe very dangerous because:\n\n\uf0b7 the clot can cut off the blood supply completely; this can cause a heart attack (myocardial \ninfarction) or stroke, or\n\n\uf0b7 the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart; this reduces the blood flow to the \nheart and can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called \u2018unstable angina\u2019).\n\nBrilique helps stop the clumping of platelets. This reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that \ncan reduce blood flow.\n\n\n\n91\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Brilique\n\nDo not take Brilique if:\n\uf0b7 You are allergic to ticagrelor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\uf0b7 You are bleeding now.\n\uf0b7 You have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.\n\uf0b7 You have severe liver disease.\n\uf0b7 You are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections) \n- clarithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections) \n- nefazodone (an antidepressant) \n- ritonavir and atazanavir (used to treat HIV infection and AIDS)\n\nDo not take Brilique if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brilique if:\n\n\uf0b7 You have an increased risk of bleeding because of:\n- a recent serious injury\n- recent surgery (including dental work, ask your dentist about this)\n- you have a condition that affects blood clotting\n- recent bleeding from your stomach or gut (such as a stomach ulcer or colon \u2018polyps\u2019)\n\n\uf0b7 You are due to have surgery (including dental work) at any time while taking Brilique. This \nis because of the increased risk of bleeding. Your doctor may want you to stop taking this \nmedicine 5 days prior to surgery.\n\n\uf0b7 Your heart rate is abnormally low (usually lower than 60 beats per minute) and you do not \nalready have in place a device that paces your heart (pacemaker).\n\n\uf0b7 You have asthma or other lung problems or breathing difficulties.\n\uf0b7 You have had any problems with your liver or have previously had any disease which may \n\nhave affected your liver.\n\uf0b7 You have had a blood test that showed more than the usual amount of uric acid.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nIf you are taking both Brilique and heparin:\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may require a sample of your blood for diagnostic tests if they suspect a rare \n\nplatelet disorder caused by heparin. It is important that you inform your doctor that you are \ntaking both Brilique and heparin, as Brilique may affect the diagnostic test.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nBrilique is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Brilique\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Brilique can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines \ncan have an effect on Brilique.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\uf0b7 more than 40 mg daily of either simvastatin or lovastatin (medicines used to treat high \n\ncholesterol)\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (an antibiotic) \n\uf0b7 phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (used to control seizures) \n\n\n\n92\n\n\uf0b7 digoxin (used to treat heart failure) \n\uf0b7 cyclosporine (used to lessen your body\u2019s defenses) \n\uf0b7 quinidine and diltiazem (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms) \n\uf0b7 beta blockers and verapamil (used to treat high blood pressure)\n\uf0b7 morphine and other opioids (used to treat severe pain)\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that \nincrease your risk of bleeding:\n\n\uf0b7 \u2018oral anticoagulants\u2019 often referred to as \u2018blood thinners\u2019 which include warfarin.\n\uf0b7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (abbreviated as NSAIDs) often taken as painkillers \n\nsuch as ibuprofen and naproxen.\n\uf0b7 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (abbreviated as SSRIs) taken as antidepressants \n\nsuch as paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram.\n\uf0b7 other medicines such as ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), clarithromycin (used \n\nto treat bacterial infections), nefazodone (an antidepressant), ritonavir and atazanavir (used \nto treat HIV infection and AIDS), cisapride (used to treat heartburn), ergot alkaloids (used to \ntreat migraines and headaches).\n\nAlso tell your doctor that because you are taking Brilique, you may have an increased risk of \nbleeding if your doctor gives you fibrinolytics, often called \u2018clot dissolvers\u2019, such as streptokinase \nor alteplase.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIt is not recommended to use Brilique if you are pregnant or may become pregnant.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Brilique is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Brilique\n3. How to take Brilique\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Brilique\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Brilique is and what it is used for \n\nWhat Brilique is\nBrilique contains an active substance called ticagrelor. This belongs to a group of medicines called \nantiplatelet medicines.\n\nWhat Brilique is used for\nBrilique in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (another antiplatelet agent) is to be used in adults \nonly. You have been given this medicine because you have had:\n\n\uf0b7 a heart attack, or\n\uf0b7 unstable angina (angina or chest pain that is not well controlled).\n\nIt reduces the chances of you having another heart attack, stroke or dying from a disease related to \nyour heart or blood vessels.\n\nHow Brilique works\nBrilique affects cells called \u2018platelets\u2019 (also called thrombocytes). These very small blood cells \nhelp stop bleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or \ndamaged. \n\nHowever, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. This can \nbe very dangerous because:\n\n\uf0b7 the clot can cut off the blood supply completely; this can cause a heart attack (myocardial \ninfarction) or stroke, or\n\n\uf0b7 the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart; this reduces the blood flow to the \nheart and can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called \u2018unstable angina\u2019).\n\nBrilique helps stop the clumping of platelets. This reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that \ncan reduce blood flow.\n\n\n\n99\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Brilique\n\nDo not take Brilique if:\n\uf0b7 You are allergic to ticagrelor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\uf0b7 You are bleeding now.\n\uf0b7 You have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.\n\uf0b7 You have severe liver disease.\n\uf0b7 You are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections) \n- clarithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections) \n- nefazodone (an antidepressant)\n- ritonavir and atazanavir (used to treat HIV infection and AIDS)\n\nDo not take Brilique if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brilique if:\n\n\uf0b7 You have an increased risk of bleeding because of:\n- a recent serious injury\n- recent surgery (including dental work, ask your dentist about this)\n- you have a condition that affects blood clotting\n- recent bleeding from your stomach or gut (such as a stomach ulcer or colon \u2018polyps\u2019)\n\n\uf0b7 You are due to have surgery (including dental work) at any time while taking Brilique. This \nis because of the increased risk of bleeding. Your doctor may want you to stop taking this \nmedicine 5 days prior to surgery.\n\n\uf0b7 Your heart rate is abnormally low (usually lower than 60 beats per minute) and you do not \nalready have in place a device that paces your heart (pacemaker).\n\n\uf0b7 You have asthma or other lung problems or breathing difficulties.\n\uf0b7 You have had any problems with your liver or have previously had any disease which may \n\nhave affected your liver.\n\uf0b7 You have had a blood test that showed more than the usual amount of uric acid.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nIf you are taking both Brilique and heparin:\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may require a sample of your blood for diagnostic tests if they suspect a rare \n\nplatelet disorder caused by heparin. It is important that you inform your doctor that you are \ntaking both Brilique and heparin, as Brilique may affect the diagnostic test.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nBrilique is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Brilique\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Brilique can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines \ncan have an effect on Brilique.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\uf0b7 more than 40 mg daily of either simvastatin or lovastatin (medicines used to treat high \n\ncholesterol)\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (an antibiotic) \n\n\n\n100\n\n\uf0b7 phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (used to control seizures) \n\uf0b7 digoxin (used to treat heart failure) \n\uf0b7 cyclosporine (used to lessen your body\u2019s defenses) \n\uf0b7 quinidine and diltiazem (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms) \n\uf0b7 beta blockers and verapamil (used to treat high blood pressure)\n\uf0b7 morphine and other opioids (used to treat severe pain)\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that \nincrease your risk of bleeding:\n\n\uf0b7 \u2018oral anticoagulants\u2019 often referred to as \u2018blood thinners\u2019 which include warfarin.\n\uf0b7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (abbreviated as NSAIDs) often taken as painkillers \n\nsuch as ibuprofen and naproxen.\n\uf0b7 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (abbreviated as SSRIs) taken as antidepressants \n\nsuch as paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram.\n\uf0b7 other medicines such as ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), clarithromycin (used \n\nto treat bacterial infections), nefazodone (an antidepressant), ritonavir and atazanavir (used \nto treat HIV infection and AIDS), cisapride (used to treat heartburn), ergot alkaloids (used to \ntreat migraines and headaches).\n\nAlso tell your doctor that because you are taking Brilique, you may have an increased risk of \nbleeding if your doctor gives you fibrinolytics, often called \u2018clot dissolvers\u2019, such as streptokinase \nor alteplase.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIt is not recommended to use Brilique if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Women should \nuse appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy while taking this medicine.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you are breast-feeding.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Brilique is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Brilique\n3. How to take Brilique\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Brilique\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Brilique is and what it is used for \n\nWhat Brilique is\nBrilique contains an active substance called ticagrelor. This belongs to a group of medicines called \nantiplatelet medicines.\n\nWhat Brilique is used for\nBrilique in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (another antiplatelet agent) is to be used in adults \nonly. You have been given this medicine because you have had:\n\n\uf0b7 a heart attack, or\n\uf0b7 unstable angina (angina or chest pain that is not well controlled).\n\nIt reduces the chances of you having another heart attack, stroke or dying from a disease related to \nyour heart or blood vessels.\n\nHow Brilique works\nBrilique affects cells called \u2018platelets\u2019 (also called thrombocytes). These very small blood cells \nhelp stop bleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or \ndamaged. \n\nHowever, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. This can \nbe very dangerous because:\n\n\uf0b7 the clot can cut off the blood supply completely; this can cause a heart attack (myocardial \ninfarction) or stroke, or\n\n\uf0b7 the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart; this reduces the blood flow to the \nheart and can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called \u2018unstable angina\u2019).\n\nBrilique helps stop the clumping of platelets. This reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that \ncan reduce blood flow.\n\n\n\n107\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Brilique\n\nDo not take Brilique if:\n\uf0b7 You are allergic to ticagrelor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\uf0b7 You are bleeding now.\n\uf0b7 You have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.\n\uf0b7 You have severe liver disease.\n\uf0b7 You are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections) \n- clarithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections) \n- nefazodone (an antidepressant)\n- ritonavir and atazanavir (used to treat HIV infection and AIDS)\n\nDo not take Brilique if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brilique if:\n\n\uf0b7 You have an increased risk of bleeding because of:\n- a recent serious injury\n- recent surgery (including dental work, ask your dentist about this)\n- you have a condition that affects blood clotting\n- recent bleeding from your stomach or gut (such as a stomach ulcer or colon \u2018polyps\u2019)\n\n\uf0b7 You are due to have surgery (including dental work) at any time while taking Brilique. This \nis because of the increased risk of bleeding. Your doctor may want you to stop taking this \nmedicine 5 days prior to surgery.\n\n\uf0b7 Your heart rate is abnormally low (usually lower than 60 beats per minute) and you do not \nalready have in place a device that paces your heart (pacemaker).\n\n\uf0b7 You have asthma or other lung problems or breathing difficulties.\n\uf0b7 You have had any problems with your liver or have previously had any disease which may \n\nhave affected your liver.\n\uf0b7 You have had a blood test that showed more than the usual amount of uric acid.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nIf you are taking both Brilique and heparin:\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may require a sample of your blood for diagnostic tests if they suspect a rare \n\nplatelet disorder caused by heparin. It is important that you inform your doctor that you are \ntaking both Brilique and heparin, as Brilique may affect the diagnostic test.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nBrilique is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Brilique\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Brilique can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines \ncan have an effect on Brilique.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\uf0b7 more than 40 mg daily of either simvastatin or lovastatin (medicines used to treat high \n\ncholesterol)\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (an antibiotic) \n\n\n\n108\n\n\uf0b7 phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (used to control seizures) \n\uf0b7 digoxin (used to treat heart failure) \n\uf0b7 cyclosporine (used to lessen your body\u2019s defenses)\n\uf0b7 quinidine and diltiazem (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms) \n\uf0b7 beta blockers and verapamil (used to treat high blood pressure)\n\uf0b7 morphine and other opioids (used to treat severe pain)\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that \nincrease your risk of bleeding:\n\n\uf0b7 \u2018oral anticoagulants\u2019 often referred to as \u2018blood thinners\u2019 which include warfarin.\n\uf0b7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (abbreviated as NSAIDs) often taken as painkillers \n\nsuch as ibuprofen and naproxen.\n\uf0b7 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (abbreviated as SSRIs) taken as antidepressants \n\nsuch as paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram.\n\uf0b7 other medicines such as ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), clarithromycin (used \n\nto treat bacterial infections), nefazodone (an antidepressant), ritonavir and atazanavir (used \nto treat HIV infection and AIDS), cisapride (used to treat heartburn), ergot alkaloids (used to \ntreat migraines and headaches).\n\nAlso tell your doctor that because you are taking Brilique, you may have an increased risk of \nbleeding if your doctor gives you fibrinolytics, often called \u2018clot dissolvers\u2019, such as streptokinase \nor alteplase.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIt is not recommended to use Brilique if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Women should \nuse appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy while taking this medicine.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you are breast-feeding.

This is a substance present in \nmany medicines used to prevent blood clotting. Your doctor will tell you how much to take \n(usually between 75-150 mg daily).\n\nHow to take Brilique\nDo not open the blister until it is time to take your medicine.\n\n\uf0b7 To take out the tablet, tear open the blister foil - do not push it through the foil because the \ntablet may break.\n\n\uf0b7 Put the tablet on your tongue and let it disintegrate. \n\uf0b7 You can then swallow it with or without water.\n\uf0b7 You can take the tablet with or without food.\n\nIf you are in the hospital you may be given this tablet mixed with some water and given through a \ntube via the nose (nasogastric tube).  \n\nIf you take more Brilique than you should\nIf you take more Brilique than you should, talk to a doctor or go to hospital straight away.

group of medicines called antiplatelet medicines. what brilique is used for brilique in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (another antiplatelet agent) is to be used in adults only. you have been given this medicine because you have had: a heart attack, over a year ago. it reduces the chances of you having another heart attack, stroke or dying from a disease related to your heart or blood vessels. how brilique works brilique affects cells called 'platelets' (also called thrombocytes). these very small blood cells help stop bleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or damaged. however, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. this can be very dangerous because: the clot can cut off the blood supply completely; this can cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke, or the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart; this reduces the blood flow to the heart and can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called 'unstable angina'). brilique helps stop the clumping of platelets. this reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that can reduce blood flow.", "Entity_Recognition":

have a condition that affects blood clotting - recent bleeding from your stomach or gut (such as a stomach ulcer or colon 'polyps') you are due to have surgery (including dental work) at any time while taking brilique. this is because of the increased risk of bleeding. your doctor may want you to stop taking this medicine 5 days prior to surgery. your heart rate is abnormally low (usually lower than 60 beats per minute) and you do not already have in place a device that paces your heart (pacemaker). you have asthma or other lung problems or breathing difficulties. you have had any problems with your liver or have previously had any disease which may have affected your liver. you have had a blood test that showed more than the usual amount of uric acid. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. if you are taking both brilique and heparin: your doctor may require a sample of your blood for diagnostic tests if they suspect a rare platelet disorder caused by heparin. it is important that you inform your doctor that you are taking both brilique and heparin, as brilique may affect the diagnostic test. children and adolescents brilique is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. other medicines and brilique please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this is because brilique can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines can have an effect on brilique. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are
