CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for the treatment of \n• Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic \n\nmyeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of \ntreatment. \n\n• Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in \naccelerated phase or blast crisis. \n\n• Adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. \n• Adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. \n• Adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. \n• Adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-\n\nderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. \n• Adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic \n\nleukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nThe effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for \n• The treatment of adult patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastatic malignant \n\ngastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). \n• The adjuvant treatment of adult patients who are at significant risk of relapse following resection of \n\nKit (CD117)-positive GIST. Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrence should not receive \nadjuvant treatment. \n\n• The treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult \npatients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. \n\n \nIn adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and \ncytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic \nresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective \nresponse rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST and DFSP and on recurrence-free \nsurvival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR \ngene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical \nbenefit or increased survival for these diseases. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with haematological \nmalignancies and malignant sarcomas, as appropriate. \n \nFor doses of 400 mg and above (see dosage recommendation below) a 400 mg film-coated tablet is available. \n \nFor doses other than 400 mg and 800 mg (see dosage recommendation below) a 100 mg film-coated tablet is \navailable. \n \nThe prescribed dose should be administered orally with a meal and a large glass of water to minimise the risk \nof gastrointestinal irritations. Doses of 400 mg or 600 mg should be administered once daily, whereas a daily \ndose of 800 mg should be administered as 400 mg twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. \n \nFor patients unable to swallow the film-coated tablets, the tablets may be dispersed in a glass of still water or \napple juice. The required number of tablets should be placed in the appropriate volume of beverage \n(approximately 50 ml for a 100 mg tablet, and 200 ml for a 400 mg tablet) and stirred with a spoon. The \nsuspension should be administered immediately after complete disintegration of the tablet(s). \n \nPosology for CML in adult patients \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 600 mg/day for adult patients in blast crisis. Blast crisis is \ndefined as blasts ≥ 30% in blood or bone marrow or extramedullary disease other than hepatosplenomegaly. \n  \nTreatment duration: In clinical trials, treatment with imatinib was continued until disease progression. The \neffect of stopping treatment after the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response has not been \ninvestigated. \n \nDose increases from 600 mg to a maximum of 800 mg (given as 400 mg twice daily) in patients with blast \ncrisis may be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-leukaemia-related \nneutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease progression (at any time); failure to \nachieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least 3 months of treatment; failure to achieve a \ncytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss of a previously achieved haematological and/or \ncytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored closely following dose escalation given the potential for \nan increased incidence of adverse reactions at higher dosages. \n \nPosology for CML in children \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily is \nrecommended for children with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML (not to exceed the total dose \nof 800 mg). Treatment can be given as a once daily dose or alternatively the daily dose may be split into two \nadministrations – one in the morning and one in the evening. The dose recommendation is currently based on \na small number of paediatric patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). There is no experience with the treatment of \nchildren below 2 years of age. \n \nDose increases from 340 mg/m2 daily to 570 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed the total dose of 800 mg) may be \nconsidered in children in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-leukaemia-related \nneutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease progression (at any time); failure to \nachieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least 3 months of treatment; failure to achieve a \ncytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss of a previously achieved haematological and/or \ncytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored closely following dose escalation given the potential for \nan increased incidence of adverse reactions at higher dosages. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in adult patients \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 600 mg/day for adult patients with Ph+ ALL. \nHaematological experts in the management of this disease should supervise the therapy throughout all phases \nof care. \n \nTreatment schedule: On the basis of the existing data, imatinib has been shown to be effective and safe when \nadministered at 600 mg/day in combination with chemotherapy in the induction phase, the consolidation and \nmaintenance phases of chemotherapy (see section 5.1) for adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. \nThe duration of imatinib therapy can vary with the treatment programme selected, but generally longer \nexposures to imatinib have yielded better results. \n \nFor adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL imatinib monotherapy at 600 mg/day is safe, effective \nand can be given until disease progression occurs. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in children \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily is \nrecommended for children with Ph+ ALL (not to exceed the total dose of 600 mg). \n \nPosology for MDS/MPD \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 400 mg/day for adult patients with MDS/MPD. \n \nTreatment duration: In the only clinical trial performed up to now, treatment with imatinib was continued \nuntil disease progression (see section 5.1). At the time of analysis, the treatment duration was a median of 47 \nmonths (24 days - 60 months). \n \nPosology for HES/CEL \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 100 mg/day for adult patients with HES/CEL. \n \nDose increase from 100 mg to 400 mg may be considered in the absence of adverse drug reactions if \nassessments demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy. \n \nTreatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. \n \nPosology for GIST \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 400 mg/day for adult patients with unresectable and/or \nmetastatic malignant GIST. \n \nLimited data exist on the effect of dose increases from 400 mg to 600 mg or 800 mg in patients progressing \nat the lower dose (see section 5.1). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nTreatment duration: In clinical trials in GIST patients, treatment with imatinib was continued until disease \nprogression. At the time of analysis, the treatment duration was a median of 7 months (7 days to 13 months). \nThe effect of stopping treatment after achieving a response has not been investigated. \n \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 400 mg/day for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients \nfollowing resection of GIST. Optimal treatment duration is not yet established. Length of treatment in the \nclinical trial supporting this indication was 36 months (see section 5.1). \n \nPosology for DFSP \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 800 mg/day for adult patients with DFSP. \n \nDose adjustment for adverse reactions \nNon-haematological adverse reactions \nIf a severe non-haematological adverse reaction develops with imatinib use, treatment must be withheld until \nthe event has resolved. Thereafter, treatment can be resumed as appropriate depending on the initial severity \nof the event. \n \nIf elevations in bilirubin > 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or in liver transaminases > 5 x \nIULN occur, imatinib should be withheld until bilirubin levels have returned to < 1.5 x IULN and \ntransaminase levels to < 2.5 x IULN. Treatment with imatinib may then be continued at a reduced daily dose. \nIn adults the dose should be reduced from 400 to 300 mg or from 600 to 400 mg, or from 800 mg to 600 mg, \nand in children from 340 to 260 mg/m2/day. \n \nHaematological adverse reactions \nDose reduction or treatment interruption for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are recommended as \nindicated in the table below. \n \nDose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: \n \nHES/CEL (starting dose \n100 mg) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/l \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/l \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and \nplatelets ≥ 75 x 109/l. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at previous \ndose (i.e. before severe adverse reaction). \n\nMDS/MPD and GIST \n(starting dose 400 mg) \nHES/CEL  \n(at dose 400 mg) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/l \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/l \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and \nplatelets ≥ 75 x 109/l. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at previous \ndose (i.e. before severe adverse reaction). \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC < 1.0 \nx109/l and/or platelets < 50 x 109/l, repeat \nstep 1 and resume imatinib at reduced dose \nof 300 mg. \n\nPaediatric chronic phase \nCML (at dose 340 \nmg/m2) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/l \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/l \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and \nplatelets ≥ 75 x 109/l. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at previous \ndose (i.e. before severe adverse reaction). \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC < 1.0 x \n109/l and/or platelets < 50 x 109/l, repeat \nstep 1 and resume imatinib at reduced dose \nof 260 mg/m2. \n\nCML in blast crisis and \nPh+ ALL (starting dose \n600 mg) \n\na ANC < 0.5 x 109/l \nand/or \nplatelets < 10 x 109/l \n\n1.

There is very limited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST \nand HES/CEL. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of imatinib in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL aged less than \n18 years of age have not been established in clinical trials. Currently available published data are \nsummarised in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nHepatic insufficiency: Imatinib is mainly metabolised through the liver. Patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere liver dysfunction should be given the minimum recommended dose of 400 mg daily. The dose can be \nreduced if not tolerated (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nLiver dysfunction classification: \n \nLiver dysfunction Liver function tests \nMild Total bilirubin: = 1.5 ULN \n\nAST: >ULN (can be normal or <ULN if total \nbilirubin is >ULN) \n\nModerate Total bilirubin: >1.5-3.0 ULN \nAST: any \n\nSevere Total bilirubin: >3-10 ULN \nAST: any \n\nULN = upper limit of normal for the institution \nAST = aspartate aminotransferase \n \nRenal insufficiency: Patients with renal dysfunction or on dialysis should be given the minimum \nrecommended dose of 400 mg daily as starting dose. However, in these patients caution is recommended. \nThe dose can be reduced if not tolerated. If tolerated, the dose can be increased for lack of efficacy (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nOlder people: Imatinib pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in older people. No significant \nage-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients in clinical trials which included \nover 20% of patients age 65 and older. No specific dose recommendation is necessary in older people. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen imatinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, there is a potential for drug interactions. \nCaution should be used when taking imatinib with protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, certain macrolides \n(see section 4.5), CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclosporine, pimozide, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, terfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel, \nquinidine) or warfarin and other coumarin derivatives (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of imatinib and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John’s Wort) may \nsignificantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Therefore, \nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nHypothyroidism \nClinical cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in thyroidectomy patients undergoing levothyroxine \nreplacement during treatment with imatinib (see section 4.5). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels \nshould be closely monitored in such patients. \n \nHepatotoxicity \nMetabolism of imatinib is mainly hepatic, and only 13% of excretion is through the kidneys. In patients with \nhepatic dysfunction (mild, moderate or severe), peripheral blood counts and liver enzymes should be \ncarefully monitored (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). It should be noted that GIST patients may have hepatic \nmetastases which could lead to hepatic impairment. \n \nCases of liver injury, including hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis, have been observed with imatinib. When \nimatinib is combined with high dose chemotherapy regimens, an increase in serious hepatic reactions has \nbeen detected. Hepatic function should be carefully monitored in circumstances where imatinib is combined \nwith chemotherapy regimens also known to be associated with hepatic dysfunction (see section 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nFluid retention \nOccurrences of severe fluid retention (pleural effusion, oedema, pulmonary oedema, ascites, superficial \noedema) have been reported in approximately 2.5% of newly diagnosed CML patients taking imatinib. \nTherefore, it is highly recommended that patients be weighed regularly. An unexpected rapid weight gain \nshould be carefully investigated and if necessary appropriate supportive care and therapeutic measures \nshould be undertaken. In clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of these events in older people and \nthose with a prior history of cardiac disease. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients with cardiac \ndysfunction. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease \nPatients with cardiac disease, risk factors for cardiac failure or history of renal failure should be monitored \ncarefully, and any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac or renal failure should be evaluated \nand treated. \n \nIn patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with occult infiltration of HES cells within the \nmyocardium, isolated cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction have been associated with HES \ncell degranulation upon the initiation of imatinib therapy. The condition was reported to be reversible with \nthe administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily withholding imatinib. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nAs cardiac adverse events have been reported uncommonly with imatinib, a careful assessment of the \nbenefit/risk of imatinib therapy should be considered in the HES/CEL population before treatment initiation. \n \nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases with PDGFR gene re-arrangements could be associated with \nhigh eosinophil levels. Evaluation by a cardiology specialist, performance of an echocardiogram and \ndetermination of serum troponin should therefore be considered in patients with HES/CEL, and in patients \nwith MDS/MPD associated with high eosinophil levels before imatinib is administered. If either is abnormal, \nfollow-up with a cardiology specialist and the prophylactic use of systemic steroids (1–2 mg/kg) for one to \ntwo weeks concomitantly with imatinib should be considered at the initiation of therapy. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, both gastrointestinal and intra-tumoural \nhaemorrhages were reported (see section 4.8). Based on the available data, no predisposing factors (e.g. \ntumour size, tumour location, coagulation disorders) have been identified that place patients with GIST at a \nhigher risk of either type of haemorrhage. Since increased vascularity and propensity for bleeding is a part of \nthe nature and clinical course of GIST, standard practices and procedures for the monitoring and \nmanagement of haemorrhage in all patients should be applied. \n \nIn addition, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), a rare cause of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, has been \nreported in post-marketing experience in patients with CML, ALL and other diseases (see section 4.8). When \nneeded, discontinuation of Imatinib Teva B.V. treatment may be considered. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nDue to the possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), correction of clinically significant \ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of imatinib (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these patients \nreceived BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or fulminant \nhepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. Experts in \nliver disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test positive for \nHBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. should be \nclosely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several \nmonths following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \nLaboratory tests \nComplete blood counts must be performed regularly during therapy with imatinib. Treatment of CML \npatients with imatinib has been associated with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. However, the occurrence \nof these cytopenias is likely to be related to the stage of the disease being treated and they were more \nfrequent in patients with accelerated phase CML or blast crisis as compared to patients with chronic phase \nCML. Treatment with imatinib may be interrupted or the dose may be reduced, as recommended in section \n4.2. \n \nLiver function (transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) should be monitored regularly in patients \nreceiving imatinib. \n \nIn patients with impaired renal function, imatinib plasma exposure seems to be higher than that in patients \nwith normal renal function, probably due to an elevated plasma level of alpha-acid glycoprotein (AGP), an \nimatinib-binding protein, in these patients. Patients with renal impairment should be given the minimum \nstarting dose. Patients with severe renal impairment should be treated with caution. The dose can be reduced \nif not tolerated (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nLong-term treatment with imatinib may be associated with a clinically significant decline in renal function. \nRenal function should, therefore, be evaluated prior to the start of imatinib therapy and closely monitored \nduring therapy, with particular attention to those patients exhibiting risk factors for renal dysfunction. If renal \ndysfunction is observed, appropriate management and treatment should be prescribed in accordance with \nstandard treatment guidelines. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere have been case reports of growth retardation occurring in children and pre-adolescents receiving \nimatinib. The long-term effects of prolonged treatment with imatinib on growth in children are unknown. \nTherefore, close monitoring of growth in children under imatinib treatment is recommended (see section \n4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: \nSubstances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors such as \nindinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; azole antifungals \nincluding ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole; certain macrolides such as erythromycin, \nclarithromycin and telithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There \nwas a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and \n40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a \nCYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 \nfamily. \n \nActive substances that may decrease imatinib plasma concentrations: \nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nrifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John’s \nWort) may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. \nPretreatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted \nin decrease in Cmax and AUC(0-∞) by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin \ntreatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while \ntaking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and \nphenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. \nConcomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. \n \nActive substances that may have their plasma concentration altered by imatinib \nImatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, \nindicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering \nimatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclosporine, pimozide, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, terfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel and \nquinidine). Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs (e.g. triazolo-\nbenzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, i.e. \nstatins, etc.). \n \nBecause of known increased risks of bleeding in conjunction with the use of imatinib (e.g. haemorrhage), \npatients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight or standard heparin, instead of \ncoumarin derivatives such as warfarin. \n \nIn vitro imatinib inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 activity at concentrations similar to those \nthat affect CYP3A4 activity. Imatinib at 400 mg twice daily had an inhibitory effect on CYP2D6-mediated \nmetoprolol metabolism, with metoprolol Cmax and AUC being increased by approximately 23% (90%CI \n[1.16-1.30]). Dose adjustments do not seem to be necessary when imatinib is co-administrated with CYP2D6 \nsubstrates, however caution is advised for CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window such as \nmetoprolol. In patients treated with metoprolol clinical monitoring should be considered. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \nIn vitro, imatinib inhibits paracetamol O-glucuronidation with Ki value of 58.5 micromol/l. This inhibition \nhas not been observed in vivo after the administration of imatinib 400 mg and paracetamol 1000 mg. Higher \ndoses of imatinib and paracetamol have not been studied. \n \nCaution should therefore be exercised when using high doses of imatinib and paracetamol concomitantly. \n \nIn thyroidectomy patients receiving levothyroxine, the plasma exposure to levothyroxine may be decreased \nwhen imatinib is co-administered (see section 4.4). Caution is therefore recommended. However, the \nmechanism of the observed interaction is presently unknown. \n \nIn Ph+ ALL patients, there is clinical experience of co-administering imatinib with chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1), but drug-drug interactions between imatinib and chemotherapy regimens are not well \ncharacterised. Imatinib adverse events, i.e. hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression or others, may increase and it \nhas been reported that concomitant use with L-asparaginase could be associated with increased \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.8). Therefore, the use of imatinib in combination requires special precaution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data on the use of imatinib in pregnant women. There have been post-marketing reports of \nspontaneous abortions and infant congenital anomalies from women who have taken imatinib. Studies in \nanimals have however shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) and the potential risk for the foetus is \nunknown. Imatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If it is used during \npregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is limited information on imatinib distribution on human milk. Studies in two breast-feeding women \nrevealed that both imatinib and its active metabolite can be distributed into human milk. The milk plasma \nratio studied in a single patient was determined to be 0.5 for imatinib and 0.9 for the metabolite, suggesting \ngreater distribution of the metabolite into the milk. Considering the combined concentration of imatinib and \nthe metabolite and the maximum daily milk intake by infants, the total exposure would be expected to be low \n(~10% of a therapeutic dose). However, since the effects of low-dose exposure of the infant to imatinib are \nunknown, women taking imatinib should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \nIn non-clinical studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected (see section 5.3). Studies on \npatients receiving imatinib and its effect on fertility and gametogenesis have not been performed. Patients \nconcerned about their fertility on imatinib treatment should consult with their physician. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as dizziness, blurred vision or \nsomnolence during treatment with imatinib. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car \nor operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nPatients with advanced stages of malignancies may have numerous confounding medical conditions that \nmake causality of adverse reactions difficult to assess due to the variety of symptoms related to the \nunderlying disease, its progression, and the co-administration of numerous medicinal products. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nIn clinical trials in CML, drug discontinuation for drug-related adverse reactions was observed in 2.4% of \nnewly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in late chronic phase after failure of interferon therapy, 4% of \npatients in accelerated phase after failure of interferon therapy and 5% of blast crisis patients after failure of \ninterferon therapy. In GIST the study drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse reactions in 4% of \npatients. \n \nThe adverse reactions were similar in all indications, with two exceptions. There was more \nmyelosuppression seen in CML patients than in GIST, which is probably due to the underlying disease. In \nthe study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, 7 (5%) patients experienced CTC grade 3/4 \nGI bleeds (3 patients), intra-tumoural bleeds (3 patients) or both (1 patient). GI tumour sites may have been \nthe source of the GI bleeds (see section 4.4). GI and tumoural bleeding may be serious and sometimes fatal. \nThe most commonly reported (≥ 10%) drug-related adverse reactions in both settings were mild nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, muscle cramps and rash. Superficial oedemas were a \ncommon finding in all studies and were described primarily as periorbital or lower limb oedemas. However, \nthese oedemas were rarely severe and may be managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by \nreducing the dose of imatinib. \n \nWhen imatinib was combined with high dose chemotherapy in Ph+ ALL patients, transient liver toxicity in \nthe form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinaemia were observed. Considering the limited safety \ndatabase, the adverse events thus far reported in children are consistent with the known safety profile in adult \npatients with Ph+ ALL. The safety database for children with Ph+ALL is very limited though no new safety \nconcerns have been identified. \n \nMiscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and rapid weight gain \nwith or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as “fluid retention”. These reactions can \nusually be managed by withholding imatinib temporarily and with diuretics and other appropriate supportive \ncare measures. However, some of these reactions may be serious or life-threatening and several patients with \nblast crisis died with a complex clinical history of pleural effusion, congestive heart failure and renal failure. \nThere were no special safety findings in paediatric clinical trials. \n \nAdverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported as more than an isolated case are listed below, by system organ class and by \nfrequency. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000),

studies and exploratory studies in unapproved \nindications. Because these reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always \npossible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to imatinib exposure. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n1 Pneumonia was reported most commonly in patients with transformed CML and in patients with \nGIST. \n\n2 Headache was the most common in GIST patients. \n3 On a patient-year basis, cardiac events including congestive heart failure were more commonly \n\nobserved in patients with transformed CML than in patients with chronic CML. \n4 Flushing was most common in GIST patients and bleeding (haematoma, haemorrhage) was most \n\ncommon in patients with GIST and with transformed CML (CML-AP and CML-BC). \n5 Pleural effusion was reported more commonly in patients with GIST and in patients with transformed \n\nCML (CML-AP and CML-BC) than in patients with chronic CML. \n6+7 Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were most commonly observed in GIST patients. \n8 Some fatal cases of hepatic failure and of hepatic necrosis have been reported. \n9 Musculoskeletal pain during treatment with imatinib or after discontinuation has been observed in \n\npost-marketing. \n10 Musculoskeletal pain and related events were more commonly observed in patients with CML than in \n\nGIST patients. \n11 Fatal cases have been reported in patients with advanced disease, severe infections, severe neutropenia \n\nand other serious concomitant conditions. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nHaematology \nIn CML, cytopenias, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, have been a consistent finding in all \nstudies, with the suggestion of a higher frequency at high doses ≥ 750 mg (phase I study). However, the \noccurrence of cytopenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the frequency of grade 3 or \n4 neutropenias (ANC < 1.0 x 109/l) and thrombocytopenias (platelet count < 50 x 109/l) being between 4 and \n6 times higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase (59–64% and 44–63% for neutropenia and \nthrombocytopenia, respectively) as compared to newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase CML (16.7% \nneutropenia and 8.9% thrombocytopenia). In newly diagnosed chronic phase CML grade 4 neutropenia \n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 10 x 109/l) were observed in 3.6% and < 1% of \npatients, respectively. The median duration of the neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes usually \nranged from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 3 to 4 weeks, respectively. These events can usually be managed with \neither a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with imatinib, but can in rare cases lead to \npermanent discontinuation of treatment. In paediatric CML patients the most frequent toxicities observed \nwere grade 3 or 4 cytopenias involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. These generally occur \nwithin the first several months of therapy. \n \nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, grade 3 and 4 anaemia was reported in \n5.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively, and may have been related to gastrointestinal or intra-tumoural \nbleeding in at least some of these patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was seen in 7.5% and 2.7% of patients, \nrespectively, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 0.7% of patients. No patient developed grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia. The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts occurred mainly during \nthe first six weeks of therapy, with values remaining relatively stable thereafter. \n \nBiochemistry \nSevere elevation of transaminases (<5%) or bilirubin (<1%) was seen in CML patients and was usually \nmanaged with dose reduction or interruption (the median duration of these episodes was approximately one \nweek). Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory abnormalities in less than 1% of \nCML patients. In GIST patients (study B2222), 6.8% of grade 3 or 4 ALT (alanine aminotransferase) \nelevations and 4.8% of grade 3 or 4 AST (aspartate aminotransferase) elevations were observed. Bilirubin \nelevation was below 3%. \n \nThere have been cases of cytolytic and cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic failure; in some of them outcome \nwas fatal, including one patient on high dose paracetamol. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in acute \nhepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with doses higher than the recommended therapeutic dose is limited. Isolated cases of imatinib \noverdose have been reported spontaneously and in the literature. In the event of overdose the patient should \nbe observed and appropriate symptomatic treatment given. Generally the reported outcome in these cases \nwas “improved” or “recovered”. Events that have been reported at different dose ranges are as follows: \n \nAdult population \n1200 to 1600 mg (duration varying between 1 to 10 days): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, erythema, \noedema, swelling, fatigue, muscle spasms, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, abdominal pain, headache, \ndecreased appetite. \n1800 to 3200 mg (as high as 3200 mg daily for 6 days): Weakness, myalgia, increased creatine \nphosphokinase, increased bilirubin, gastrointestinal pain. \n6400 mg (single dose): One case reported in the literature of one patient who experienced nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, pyrexia, facial swelling, decreased neutrophil count, increased transaminases. \n8 to 10 g (single dose): Vomiting and gastrointestinal pain have been reported. \n \nPaediatric population \nOne 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 400 mg experienced vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia and \nanother 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 980 mg experienced decreased white blood cell count \nand diarrhoea. \n \nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE01 \n \nMechanism of action \nImatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of the Bcr-Abl \ntyrosine kinase (TK), as well as several receptor TKs: Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) coded for \nby the c-Kit proto-oncogene, the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2), the colony stimulating \nfactor receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR-alpha and \nPDGFR-beta). Imatinib can also inhibit cellular events mediated by activation of these receptor kinases. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nImatinib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase at the in \nvitro, cellular and in vivo levels. The compound selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in \nBcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukaemic cells from Philadelphia chromosome positive CML and \nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. \n \nIn vivo the compound shows anti-tumour activity as a single agent in animal models using Bcr-Abl positive \ntumour cells. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n \n\nImatinib is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), \nPDGF-R, and stem cell factor (SCF), c-Kit, and inhibits PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular events. In vitro, \nimatinib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) cells, which \nexpress an activating kit mutation. Constitutive activation of the PDGF receptor or the Abl protein tyrosine \nkinases as a consequence of fusion to diverse partner proteins or constitutive production of PDGF have been \nimplicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/MPD, HES/CEL and DFSP. Imatinib inhibits signalling and \nproliferation of cells driven by dysregulated PDGFR and Abl kinase activity. \n \nClinical studies in chronic myeloid leukaemia \nThe effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and \nprogression-free survival. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as \nimprovement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival. \n \nA large, international, open-label, non-controlled phase II study was conducted in patients with Philadelphia \nchromosome positive (Ph+) CML in blast crisis phase of the disease. In addition, children have been treated \nin two phase I studies and one phase II study. \n \nIn all clinical studies 38–40% of patients were ≥ 60 years of age and 10–12% of patients were ≥ 70 years of \nage. \n \nMyeloid blast crisis: 260 patients with myeloid blast crisis were enrolled. 95 (37%) had received prior \nchemotherapy for treatment of either accelerated phase or blast crisis (“pretreated patients”) whereas 165 \n(63%) had not (“untreated patients”). The first 37 patients were started at 400 mg, the protocol was \nsubsequently amended to allow higher dosing and the remaining 223 patients were started at 600 mg. \n \nThe primary efficacy variable was the rate of haematological response, reported as either complete \nhaematological response, no evidence of leukaemia (i.e. clearance of blasts from the marrow and the blood, \nbut without a full peripheral blood recovery as for complete responses), or return to chronic phase CML. In \nthis study, 31% of patients achieved a haematological response (36% in previously untreated patients and \n22% in previously treated patients). The rate of response was also higher in the patients treated at 600 mg \n(33%) as compared to the patients treated at 400 mg (16%, p=0.0220). The current estimate of the median \nsurvival of the previously untreated and treated patients was 7.7 and 4.7 months, respectively. \n \nLymphoid blast crisis: a limited number of patients were enrolled in phase I studies (n=10). The rate of \nhaematological response was 70% with a duration of 2–3 months. \n \nTable 2 Response in adult CML studies \n \n Study 0102 38-month data \n\nMyeloid blast crisis \n(n=260) \n\n % of patients (CI95%) \nHaematological response1  \n\nComplete haematological response (CHR) \n \n\nNo evidence of leukaemia (NEL) \n \nReturn to chronic phase (RTC)  \n\n31% (25.2-36.8) \n8% \n\n \n5% \n\n \n18% \n\nMajor cytogenetic response2  15% (11.2-20.4) \nComplete  7% \n(Confirmed3) [95% CI]  (2%) [0.6-4.4] \nPartial  8% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n1 Haematological response criteria (all responses to be confirmed after ≥ 4 weeks):  \nCHR: In study 0102 [ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, platelets ≥ 100 x 109/l, no blood blasts, BM blasts < 5% \nand no extramedullary disease]  \nNEL Same criteria as for CHR but ANC ≥ 1 x 109/l and platelets ≥ 20 x 109/l  \nRTC < 15% blasts BM and PB, < 30% blasts+promyelocytes in BM and PB, < 20% basophils in \nPB, no extramedullary disease other than spleen and liver.  \nBM = bone marrow, PB = peripheral blood  \n2 Cytogenetic response criteria:  \nA major response combines both complete and partial responses: complete (0% Ph+ metaphases), \npartial (1-35%)  \n3 Complete cytogenetic response confirmed by a second bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation \nperformed at least one month after the initial bone marrow study  \n\n \nPaediatric patients: A total of 26 paediatric patients of age < 18 years with either chronic phase CML (n=11) \nor CML in blast crisis or Ph+ acute leukaemias (n=15) were enrolled in a dose-escalation phase I trial. This \nwas a population of heavily pretreated patients, as 46% had received prior BMT and 73% a prior multi-agent \nchemotherapy. Patients were treated at doses of imatinib of 260 mg/m2/day (n=5), 340 mg/m2/day (n=9), 440 \nmg/m2/day (n=7) and 570 mg/m2/day (n=5). Out of 9 patients with chronic phase CML and cytogenetic data \navailable, 4 (44%) and 3 (33%) achieved a complete and partial cytogenetic response, respectively, for a rate \nof MCyR of 77%. \n \nA total of 51 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed and untreated CML in chronic phase have been \nenrolled in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II trial. Patients were treated with imatinib 340 \nmg/m2/day, with no interruptions in the absence of dose limiting toxicity. Imatinib treatment induces a rapid \nresponse in newly diagnosed paediatric CML patients with a CHR of 78% after 8 weeks of therapy. The high \nrate of CHR is accompanied by the development of a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) of 65% which \nis comparable to the results observed in adults. Additionally, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) was \nobserved in 16% for a MCyR of 81%. The majority of patients who achieved a CCyR developed the CCyR \nbetween months 3 and 10 with a median time to response based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5.6 months. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with imatinib in \nall subsets of the paediatric population in Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl translocation)-positive chronic \nmyeloid leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nClinical studies in Ph+ ALL \nNewly diagnosed Ph+ ALL: In a controlled study (ADE10) of imatinib versus chemotherapy induction in 55 \nnewly diagnosed patients aged 55 years and over, imatinib used as single agent induced a significantly higher \nrate of complete haematological response than chemotherapy (96.3% vs. 50%; p=0.0001). When salvage \ntherapy with imatinib was administered in patients who did not respond or who responded poorly to \nchemotherapy, it resulted in 9 patients (81.8%) out of 11 achieving a complete haematological response. This \nclinical effect was associated with a higher reduction in bcr-abl transcripts in the imatinib-treated patients \nthan in the chemotherapy arm after 2 weeks of therapy (p=0.02). All patients received imatinib and \nconsolidation chemotherapy (see Table 3) after induction and the levels of bcr-abl transcripts were identical \nin the two arms at 8 weeks. As expected on the basis of the study design, no difference was observed in \nremission duration, disease-free survival or overall survival, although patients with complete molecular \nresponse and remaining in minimal residual disease had a better outcome in terms of both remission duration \n(p=0.01) and disease-free survival (p=0.02). \n \nThe results observed in a population of 211 newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients in four uncontrolled clinical \nstudies (AAU02, ADE04, AJP01 and AUS01) are consistent with the results described above. Imatinib in \ncombination with chemotherapy induction (see Table 3) resulted in a complete haematological response rate \nof 93% (147 out of 158 evaluable patients) and in a major cytogenetic response rate of 90% (19 out of 21 \nevaluable patients). The complete molecular response rate was 48% (49 out of 102 evaluable patients). \nDisease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) constantly exceeded 1 year and were superior to \nhistorical control (DFS p<0.001; OS p<0.0001) in two studies (AJP01 and AUS01). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \nTable 3 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib \n \n\nStudy ADE10  \nPrephase DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 1-5; \n\nCP 200 mg/m2 i.v., days 3, 4, 5; \nMTX 12 mg intrathecal, day 1 \n\nRemission induction  DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 6-7, 13-16; \nVCR 1 mg i.v., days 7, 14; \nIDA 8 mg/m2 i.v.

The estimated 4-year OS in cohort 5-patients was 83.6% compared to 44.8% in the \nhistorical controls. 20 out of the 50 (40%) patients in cohort 5 received haematopoietic stem cell transplant. \n \nTable 4 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib in study I2301 \n \nConsolidation block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nIfosfamide (1.8 g/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nMESNA (360 mg/m2/dose q3h, x 8 doses/day, IV): days 1-5 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 6-15 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nIT Methotrexate (age-adjusted): day 1 ONLY \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 8, 15 \n\nConsolidation block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: Days 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 1 \nARA-C (3 g/m2/dose q 12 h x 4, IV): days 2 and 3 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 4-13 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \n\nReinduction block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8, and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, IV): days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 1 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: Days 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nReinduction block 2 VCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8 and 15 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n(3 weeks) DAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, iv): Days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 2 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: days 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycles 1–4 \n\nMTX (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: days 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1, 29 \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 8-28 \nMethotrexate (20 mg/m2/week, PO): days 8, 15, 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nCPM (300 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nMESNA IV days 29-33 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 34-43 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycle 5 \n\nCranial irradiation (Block 5 only) \n12 Gy in 8 fractions for all patients that are CNS1 and CNS2 at \ndiagnosis \n18 Gy in 10 fractions for patients that are CNS3 at diagnosis \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 11-56 (Withhold 6-MP during the 6-10 \ndays of cranial irradiation beginning on day 1 of Cycle 5.

Safety data from this study seem to be in \nline with the safety profile of imatinib in Ph+ ALL patients. \n \nRelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL: When imatinib was used as single agent in patients with relapsed/refractory \nPh+ ALL, it resulted, in the 53 out of 411 patients evaluable for response, in a haematological response rate \nof 30% (9% complete) and a major cytogenetic response rate of 23%. (Of note, out of the 411 patients, 353 \nwere treated in an expanded access program without primary response data collected.)

The data \nwas similar when re-analysed to include only those patients age 55 or older. \n \nClinical studies in MDS/MPD \nExperience with imatinib in this indication is very limited and is based on haematological and cytogenetic \nresponse rates. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival. One open \nlabel, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing imatinib in diverse populations \nof patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with Abl, Kit or PDGFR protein tyrosine \nkinases. This study included 7 patients with MDS/MPD who were treated with imatinib 400 mg daily. Three \npatients presented a complete haematological response (CHR) and one patient experienced a partial \nhaematological response (PHR). At the time of the original analysis, three of the four patients with detected \nPDGFR gene rearrangements developed haematological response (2 CHR and 1 PHR). The age of these \npatients ranged from 20 to 72 years. \n \nAn observational registry (study L2401) was conducted to collect long-term safety and efficacy data in \npatients suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms with PDGFR- β rearrangement and who were treated \nwith imatinib. The 23 patients enrolled in this registry received imatinib at a median daily dose of 264 mg \n(range: 100 to 400 mg) for a median duration of 7.2 years (range 0.1 to 12.7 years). Due to the observational \nnature of this registry, haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular assessment data were available for 22, 9 and \n17 of the 23 enrolled patients, respectively. When assuming conservatively that patients with missing data \nwere non-responders, CHR was observed in 20/23 (87%) patients, CCyR in 9/23 (39.1%) patients, and MR \nin 11/23 (47.8%) patients, respectively. When the response rate is calculated from patients with at least one \nvalid assessment, the response rate for CHR, CCyR and MR was 20/22 (90.9%), 9/9 (100%) and 11/17 \n(64.7%), respectively. \n \nIn addition a further 24 patients with MDS/MPD were reported in 13 publications. 21 patients were treated \nwith imatinib 400 mg daily, while the other 3 patients received lower doses. In eleven patients PDGFR gene \nrearrangements was detected, 9 of them achieved a CHR and 1 PHR. The age of these patients ranged from 2 \nto 79 years. In a recent publication updated information from 6 of these 11 patients revealed that all these \npatients remained in cytogenetic remission (range 32-38 months). The same publication reported long term \nfollow-up data from 12 MDS/MPD patients with PDGFR gene rearrangements (5 patients from study \nB2225). These patients received imatinib for a median of 47 months (range 24 days – 60 months). In 6 of \nthese patients follow-up now exceeds 4 years. Eleven patients achieved rapid CHR; ten had complete \nresolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and a decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by \nRT-PCR. Haematological and cytogenetic responses have been sustained for a median of 49 months (range \n19-60) and 47 months (range 16-59), respectively. The overall survival is 65 months since diagnosis (range \n25-234). Imatinib administration to patients without the genetic translocation generally results in no \nimprovement. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with MDS/MPD. Five (5) patients with MDS/MPD \nassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 4 publications. The age of these patients \nranged from 3 months to 4 years and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging from 92.5 to \n340 mg/m2 daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, cytogenetic response and/or \nclinical response. \n \nClinical studies in HES/CEL \nOne open-label, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing imatinib in diverse \npopulations of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with Abl, Kit or PDGFR protein \ntyrosine kinases. In this study, 14 patients with HES/CEL were treated with 100 mg to 1,000 mg of imatinib \ndaily. A further 162 patients with HES/CEL, reported in 35 published case reports and case series received \nimatinib at doses from 75 mg to 800 mg daily. Cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated in 117 of the total \npopulation of 176 patients. In 61 of these 117 patients FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase was identified. An \nadditional four HES patients were found to be FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive in other 3 published reports. All 65 \nFIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase positive patients achieved a CHR sustained for months (range from 1+ to \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n44+ months censored at the time of the reporting). As reported in a recent publication 21 of these 65 patients \nalso achieved complete molecular remission with a median follow-up of 28 months (range 13-67 months). \nThe age of these patients ranged from 25 to 72 years. Additionally, improvements in symptomatology and \nother organ dysfunction abnormalities were reported by the investigators in the case reports. Improvements \nwere reported in cardiac, nervous, skin/subcutaneous tissue, respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal, \nmusculoskeletal/connective tissue/vascular, and gastrointestinal organ systems. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with HES/CEL. Three (3) patients with HES and CEL \nassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these patients \nranged from 2 to 16 years and imatinib was given at dose 300 mg/m2 daily or doses ranging from 200 to 400 \nmg daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, complete cytogenetic response and/or \ncomplete molecular response. \n \nClinical studies in unresectable and/or metastatic GIST \nOne phase II, open-label, randomised, uncontrolled multinational study was conducted in patients with \nunresectable or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). In this study 147 patients were \nenrolled and randomised to receive either 400 mg or 600 mg orally once daily for up to 36 months. These \npatients ranged in age from 18 to 83 years old and had a pathologic diagnosis of Kit-positive malignant GIST \nthat was unresectable and/or metastatic. Immunohistochemistry was routinely performed with Kit antibody \n(A-4502, rabbit polyclonal antiserum, 1:100; DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) according to analysis by \nan avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method after antigen retrieval. \n \nThe primary evidence of efficacy was based on objective response rates. Tumours were required to be \nmeasurable in at least one site of disease, and response characterisation based on Southwestern Oncology \nGroup (SWOG) criteria. Results are provided in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 Best tumour response in trial STIB2222 (GIST) \n \n \n \n \nBest response \n\nAll doses (n=147) \n400 mg (n=73) \n600 mg (n=74) \n\nn (%) \nComplete response 1 (0.7) \nPartial response 98 (66.7) \nStable disease 23 (15.6) \nProgressive disease 18 (12.2) \nNot evaluable 5 (3.4) \nUnknown 2 (1.4) \n \nThere were no differences in response rates between the two dose groups. A significant number of patients \nwho had stable disease at the time of the interim analysis achieved a partial response with longer treatment \n(median follow-up 31 months). Median time to response was 13 weeks (95% C.I. 12–23). Median time to \ntreatment failure in responders was 122 weeks (95% C.I 106–147), while in the overall study population it \nwas 84 weeks (95% C.I 71–109). The median overall survival has not been reached. The Kaplan-Meier \nestimate for survival after 36-month follow-up is 68%. \n \nIn two clinical studies (study B2222 and an intergroup study S0033) the daily dose of imatinib was escalated \nto 800 mg in patients progressing at the lower daily doses of 400 mg or 600 mg. The daily dose was \nescalated to 800 mg in a total of 103 patients; 6 patients achieved a partial response and 21 stabilisation of \ntheir disease after dose escalation for an overall clinical benefit of 26%. From the safety data available, \nescalating the dose to 800 mg daily in patients progressing at lower doses of 400 mg or 600 mg daily does \nnot seem to affect the safety profile of imatinib. \n \nClinical studies in adjuvant GIST \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nIn the adjuvant setting, imatinib was investigated in a multicentre, double-blind, long-term, placebo-\ncontrolled phase III study (Z9001) involving 773 patients. The ages of these patients ranged from 18 to 91 \nyears. Patients were included who had a histological diagnosis of primary GIST expressing Kit protein by \nimmunochemistry and a tumour size ≥ 3 cm in maximum dimension, with complete gross resection of \nprimary GIST within 14-70 days prior to registration. After resection of primary GIST, patients were \nrandomised to one of the two arms: imatinib at 400 mg/day or matching placebo for one year. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from date of \nrandomisation to the date of recurrence or death from any cause. \n \nImatinib significantly prolonged RFS, with 75% of patients being recurrence-free at 38 months in the \nimatinib group vs. 20 months in the placebo group (95% CIs, [30 - non-estimable]; [14 - non- estimable], \nrespectively); (hazard ratio = 0.398 [0.259-0.610], p<0.0001). At one year the overall RFS was significantly \nbetter for imatinib (97.7%) vs. placebo (82.3%), (p<0.0001). The risk of recurrence was thus reduced by \napproximately 89% as compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0.113 [0.049-0.264]). \n \nThe risk of recurrence in patients after surgery of their primary GIST was retrospectively assessed based on \nthe following prognostic factors: tumour size, mitotic index, tumour location. Mitotic index data were \navailable for 556 of the 713 intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The results of subgroup analyses according \nto the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) \nrisk classifications are shown in Table 6. No benefit was observed in the low and very low risk groups. No \noverall survival benefit has been observed. \n \nTable 6 Summary of Z9001 trial RFS analyses by NIH and AFIP risk classifications \n \n\nRisk \ncriteria \n\nRisk level % of \npatients \n\nNo. of events /  \nNo. of patients \n\nOverall hazard \nratio (95% CI) \n\n* \n\nRFS rates (%) \n12 month 24 month \n\nImatinib vs placebo Imatinib vs \nplacebo \n\nImatinib vs \nplacebo \n\nNIH \nLow 29.5 0/86 vs. 2/90 N.E. 100 vs. 98.7 100 vs. 95.5 \nIntermediate 25.7 4/75 vs. 6/78 0.59 (0.17; 2.10) 100 vs. 94.8 97.8 vs. 89.5 \nHigh 44.8 21/140 vs. 51/127 0.29 (0.18; 0.49) 94.8 vs. 64.0 80.7 vs. 46.6 \n\n \nAFIP \n\nVery low 20.7 0/52 vs. 2/63 N.E. 100 vs. 98.1 100 vs. 93.0 \nLow 25.0 2/70 vs. 0/69 N.E. 100 vs. 100 97.8 vs. 100 \nModerate 24.6 2/70 vs. 11/67 0.16 (0.03; 0.70) 97.9 vs. 90.8 97.9 vs. 73.3 \nHigh 29.7 16/84 vs. 39/81 0.27 (0.15; 0.48) 98.7 vs. 56.1 79.9 vs. 41.5 \n\n* Full follow-up period; NE – Not estimable \n \nA second multicentre, open label phase III study (SSG XVIII/AIO) compared 400 mg/day imatinib 12 \nmonths treatment vs. 36 months treatment in patients after surgical resection of GIST and one of the \nfollowing: tumour diameter > 5 cm and mitotic count > 5/50 high power fields (HPF); or tumour diameter > \n10 cm and any mitotic count or tumour of any size with mitotic count > 10/50 HPF or tumours ruptured into \nthe peritoneal cavity. There were a total of 397 patients consented and randomised to the study (199 patients \non 12-month arm and 198 patients on 36-month arm), median age was 61 years (range 22 to 84 years). The \nmedian time of follow-up was 54 months (from date of randomisation to data cut-off), with a total of 83 \nmonths between the first patient randomised and the cut-off date. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from \ndate of randomisation to the date of recurrence or death from any cause. \n \nThirty-six (36) months of imatinib treatment significantly prolonged RFS compared to 12 months of imatinib \ntreatment (with overall Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.46 [0.32, 0.65], p<0.0001) (Table 7, Figure 1). \n \nIn addition, thirty-six (36) months of imatinib treatment significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) \ncompared to 12 months of imatinib treatment (HR = 0.45 [0.22, 0.89], p=0.0187) (Table 7, Figure 2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nLonger duration of the treatment (> 36 months) may delay the onset of further recurrences; \nhowever the impact of this finding on the overall survival remains unknown. \n \nThe total number of deaths were 25 for the 12-month treatment arm and 12 for the 36-month \ntreatment arm.  \n \nTreatment with imatinib for 36 months was superior to treatment for 12 months in the ITT \nanalysis, i.e. including the entire study population. In a planned subgroup analysis by mutation \ntype, the HR for RFS for 36 months of treatment for patients with mutations of exon 11 was 0.35 \n[95% CI: 0.22, 0.56].

Seventeen (17) patients with \nGIST (with or without Kit and PDGFR mutations) were reported in 7 publications. The age of these patients \nranged from 8 to 18 years and imatinib was given in both adjuvant and metastatic settings at doses ranging \nfrom 300 to 800 mg daily. The majority of paediatric patients treated for GIST lacked data confirming c-kit \nor PDGFR mutations which may have led to mixed clinical outcomes. \n \nClinical studies in DFSP \nOne phase II, open label, multicentre clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted including 12 patients with \nDFSP treated with imatinib 800 mg daily. The age of the DFSP patients ranged from 23 to 75 years; DFSP \nwas metastatic, locally recurrent following initial resective surgery and not considered amenable to further \nresective surgery at the time of study entry. The primary evidence of efficacy was based on objective \nresponse rates. Out of the 12 patients enrolled, 9 responded, one completely and 8 partially. Three of the \npartial responders were subsequently rendered disease free by surgery. The median duration of therapy in \nstudy B2225 was 6.2 months, with a maximum duration of 24.3 months. A further 6 DFSP patients treated \nwith imatinib were reported in 5 published case reports, their ages ranging from 18 months to 49 years. The \nadult patients reported in the published literature were treated with either 400 mg (4 cases) or 800 mg (1 \ncase) imatinib daily. Five (5) patients responded, 3 completely and 2 partially. The median duration of \ntherapy in the published literature ranged between 4 weeks and more than 20 months. The translocation \nt(17:22)[(q22:q13)], or its gene product, was present in nearly all responders to imatinib treatment. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with DFSP. Five (5) patients with DFSP and PDGFR \ngene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these patients ranged from newborn to 14 \nyears and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging from 400 to 520 mg/m2 daily. All patients \nachieved partial and/or complete response. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetics of imatinib \nThe pharmacokinetics of imatinib have been evaluated over a dosage range of 25 to 1,000 mg. Plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles were analysed on day 1 and on either day 7 or day 28, by which time plasma \nconcentrations had reached steady state. \n \nAbsorption \nMean absolute bioavailability for imatinib is 98%. There was high between-patient variability in plasma \nimatinib AUC levels after an oral dose. When given with a high-fat meal, the rate of absorption of imatinib \nwas minimally reduced (11% decrease in Cmax and prolongation of tmax by 1.5 h), with a small reduction in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nAUC (7.4%) compared to fasting conditions. The effect of prior gastrointestinal surgery on drug absorption \nhas not been investigated. \n \nDistribution \nAt clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 95% on the \nbasis of in vitro experiments, mostly to albumin and alpha-acid-glycoprotein, with little binding to \nlipoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe main circulating metabolite in humans is the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, which shows similar \nin vitro potency to the parent. The plasma AUC for this metabolite was found to be only 16% of the AUC for \nimatinib. The plasma protein binding of the N-demethylated metabolite is similar to that of the parent \ncompound. \n \nImatinib and the N-demethyl metabolite together accounted for about 65% of the circulating radioactivity \n(AUC(0-48h)). The remaining circulating radioactivity consisted of a number of minor metabolites. \n \nThe in vitro results showed that CYP3A4 was the major human P450 enzyme catalysing the \nbiotransformation of imatinib. Of a panel of potential comedications (acetaminophen, aciclovir, allopurinol, \namphotericin, cytarabine, erythromycin, fluconazole, hydroxyurea, norfloxacin, penicillin V) only \nerythromycin (IC50 50 μM) and fluconazole (IC50 118 μM) showed inhibition of imatinib metabolism which \ncould have clinical relevance. \n \nImatinib was shown in vitro to be a competitive inhibitor of marker substrates for CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4/5. Ki values in human liver microsomes were 27, 7.5 and 7.9 µmol/l, respectively. Maximal plasma \nconcentrations of imatinib in patients are 2-4 µmol/l, consequently an inhibition of CYP2D6 and/or \nCYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism of co-administered drugs is possible. Imatinib did not interfere with the \nbiotransformation of 5-fluorouracil, but it inhibited paclitaxel metabolism as a result of competitive \ninhibition of CYP2C8 (Ki = 34.7 μM). This K i value is far higher than the expected plasma levels of imatinib \nin patients; consequently no interaction is expected upon co-administration of either 5-fluorouracil or \npaclitaxel and imatinib. \n \nElimination \nBased on the recovery of compound(s) after an oral 14C-labelled dose of imatinib, approximately 81% of the \ndose was recovered within 7 days in faeces (68% of dose) and urine (13% of dose). Unchanged imatinib \naccounted for 25% of the dose (5% urine, 20% faeces), the remainder being metabolites. \n \nPlasma pharmacokinetics \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the t½ was approximately 18 h, suggesting that once-\ndaily dosing is appropriate. The increase in mean AUC with increasing dose was linear and dose proportional \nin the range of 25-1,000 mg imatinib after oral administration. There was no change in the kinetics of \nimatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation was 1.5-2.5-fold at steady state when dosed once daily. \n \nPharmacokinetics in GIST patients \nIn patients with GIST steady-state exposure was 1.5-fold higher than that observed for CML patients for the \nsame dosage (400 mg daily). Based on preliminary population pharmacokinetic analysis in GIST patients, \nthere were three variables (albumin, WBC and bilirubin) found to have a statistically significant relationship \nwith imatinib pharmacokinetics. Decreased values of albumin caused a reduced clearance (CL/f); and higher \nlevels of WBC led to a reduction of CL/f. However, these associations are not sufficiently pronounced to \nwarrant dose adjustment. In this patient population, the presence of hepatic metastases could potentially lead \nto hepatic insufficiency and reduced metabolism. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis in CML patients, there was a small effect of age on the \nvolume of distribution (12% increase in patients > 65 years old). This change is not thought to be clinically \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nsignificant. The effect of bodyweight on the clearance of imatinib is such that for a patient weighing 50 kg \nthe mean clearance is expected to be 8.5 l/h, while for a patient weighing 100 kg the clearance will rise to \n11.8 l/h. These changes are not considered sufficient to warrant dose adjustment based on kg bodyweight. \nThere is no effect of gender on the kinetics of imatinib. \n \nPharmacokinetics in children \nAs in adult patients, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in paediatric patients in both \nphase I and phase II studies. Dosing in children at 260 and 340 mg/m2/day achieved the same exposure, \nrespectively, as doses of 400 mg and 600 mg in adult patients. The comparison of AUC(0-24) on day 8 and day \n1 at the 340 mg/m2/day dose level revealed a 1.7-fold drug accumulation after repeated once-daily dosing. \n \nBased on pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis in paediatric patients with haematological disorders \n(CML, Ph+ALL, or other haematological disorders treated with imatinib), clearance of imatinib increases \nwith increasing body surface area (BSA). After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics such as \nage, body weight and body mass index did not have clinically significant effects on the exposure of imatinib. \nThe analysis confirmed that exposure of imatinib in paediatric patients receiving 260 mg/m2 once daily (not \nexceeding 400 mg once daily) or 340 mg/m2 once daily (not exceeding 600 mg once daily) were similar to \nthose in adult patients who received imatinib 400 mg or 600 mg once daily. \n \nOrgan function impairment \nImatinib and its metabolites are not excreted via the kidney to a significant extent. Patients with mild and \nmoderate impairment of renal function appear to have a higher plasma exposure than patients with normal \nrenal function. The increase is approximately 1.5- to 2-fold, corresponding to a 1.5-fold elevation of plasma \nAGP, to which imatinib binds strongly. The free drug clearance of imatinib is probably similar between \npatients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function, since renal excretion represents only a \nminor elimination pathway for imatinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nAlthough the results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is considerable inter-subject variation, \nthe mean exposure to imatinib did not increase in patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction as \ncompared to patients with normal liver function (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of imatinib was assessed in rats, dogs, monkeys and rabbits. \n \nMultiple dose toxicity studies revealed mild to moderate haematological changes in rats, dogs and monkeys, \naccompanied by bone marrow changes in rats and dogs. \n \nThe liver was a target organ in rats and dogs. Mild to moderate increases in transaminases and slight \ndecreases in cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein and albumin levels were observed in both species. No \nhistopathological changes were seen in rat liver. Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated for 2 \nweeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct hyperplasia. \n \nRenal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralisation and dilation of the \nrenal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were observed in \nseveral of these animals. In rats, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium in the renal papilla and in the \nurinary bladder was observed at doses ≥ 6 mg/kg in the 13-week study, without changes in serum or urinary \nparameters. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed with chronic imatinib treatment. \n \nIn a 39-week monkey study, no NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) was established at the lowest \ndose of 15 mg/kg, approximately one-third the maximum human dose of 800 mg based on body surface. \nTreatment resulted in worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these animals. \n \nImatinib was not considered genotoxic when tested in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test), an in vitro \nmammalian cell assay (mouse lymphoma) and an in vivo rat micronucleus test. Positive genotoxic effects \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nwere obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster ovary) for clastogenicity \n(chromosome aberration) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two intermediates of the manufacturing \nprocess, which are also present in the final product, are positive for mutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of \nthese intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma assay. \n \nIn a study of fertility, in male rats dosed for 70 days prior to mating, testicular and epididymal weights and \npercent motile sperm were decreased at 60 mg/kg, approximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 \nmg/day, based on body surface area. This was not seen at doses ≤ 20 mg/kg. A slight to moderate reduction \nin spermatogenesis was also observed in the dog at oral doses ≥ 30 mg/kg. When female rats were dosed 14 \ndays prior to mating and through to gestational day 6, there was no effect on mating or on number of \npregnant females. At a dose of 60 mg/kg, female rats had significant post-implantation foetal loss and a \nreduced number of live foetuses. This was not seen at doses ≤ 20 mg/kg. \n \nIn an oral pre- and postnatal development study in rats, red vaginal discharge was noted in the 45 mg/kg/day \ngroup on either day 14 or day 15 of gestation. At the same dose, the number of stillborn pups as well as those \ndying between postpartum days 0 and 4 was increased. In the F1 offspring, at the same dose level, mean \nbody weights were reduced from birth until terminal sacrifice and the number of litters achieving criterion \nfor preputial separation was slightly decreased. F1 fertility was not affected, while an increased number of \nresorptions and a decreased number of viable foetuses was noted at 45 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect \nlevel (NOEL) for both the maternal animals and the F1 generation was 15 mg/kg/day (one quarter of the \nmaximum human dose of 800 mg). \n \nImatinib was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg, \napproximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day, based on body surface area. Teratogenic \neffects included exencephaly or encephalocele, absent/reduced frontal and absent parietal bones. These \neffects were not seen at doses ≤ 30 mg/kg. \n \nNo new target organs were identified in the rat juvenile development toxicology study (day 10 to 70 \npostpartum) with respect to the known target organs in adult rats. In the juvenile toxicology study, effects \nupon growth, delay in vaginal opening and preputial separation were observed at approximately 0.3 to 2 \ntimes the average paediatric exposure at the highest recommended dose of 340 mg/m2. In addition, mortality \nwas observed in juvenile animals (around weaning phase) at approximately 2 times the average paediatric \nexposure at the highest recommended dose of 340 mg/m2. \n \nIn the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study administration of imatinib at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day resulted in a \nstatistically significant reduction in the longevity of males at 60 mg/kg/day and females at ≥30 mg/kg/day. \nHistopathological examination of decedents revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), chronic progressive \nnephropathy (females) and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death or reasons for sacrifice. \nTarget organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys, urinary bladder, urethra, preputial and clitoral gland, \nsmall intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands and non-glandular stomach. \n \nPapilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland were noted from 30 mg/kg/day onwards, representing \napproximately 0.5 or 0.3 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, \nrespectively, and 0.4 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2/day. The no \nobserved effect level (NOEL) was 15 mg/kg/day. The renal adenoma/carcinoma, the urinary bladder and \nurethra papilloma, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, the parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and \nmalignant medullary tumours of the adrenal glands and the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas \nwere noted at 60 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 1.7 or 1 times the human daily exposure (based on \nAUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, respectively, and 1.2 times the daily exposure in children (based on \nAUC) at 340 mg/m2/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) was 30 mg/kg/day. \n \nThe mechanism and relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans are not yet \nclarified. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nNon-neoplastic lesions not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, pancreas, \nendocrine organs and teeth. The most important changes included cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, leading \nto signs of cardiac insufficiency in some animals. \n \nThe active substance imatinib demonstrates an environmental risk for sediment organisms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for the treatment of  \n• Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic \n\nmyeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of \ntreatment.  \n\n• Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in \naccelerated phase or blast crisis. \n\n• Adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. \n• Adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy.  \n• Adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. \n• Adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-\n\nderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. \n• Adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic \n\nleukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. \n \nThe effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined.  \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n• The treatment of adult patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastatic malignant \ngastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). \n\n• The adjuvant treatment of adult patients who are at significant risk of relapse following resection of \nKit (CD117)-positive GIST. Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrence should not receive \nadjuvant treatment. \n\n• The treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult \npatients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. \n \n\nIn adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and \ncytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic \nresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective \nresponse rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST and DFSP and on recurrence-free \nsurvival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR \ngene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical \nbenefit or increased survival for these diseases.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with haematological \nmalignancies and malignant sarcomas, as appropriate. \n \nThe prescribed dose should be administered orally with a meal and a large glass of water to minimise the risk \nof gastrointestinal irritations. Doses of 400 mg or 600 mg should be administered once daily, whereas a daily \ndose of 800 mg should be administered as 400 mg twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. For \npatients (children) unable to swallow the capsules, their content may be diluted in a glass of either still water \nor apple juice. Since studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, and the potential risk for the \nhuman foetus is unknown, women of child-bearing potential who open capsules should be advised to handle \nthe contents with caution and avoid skin-eye contact or inhalation (see section 4.6). Hands should be washed \nimmediately after handling open capsules.  \n \nPosology for CML in adult patients  \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 600 mg/day for adult patients in blast crisis. Blast crisis is \ndefined as blasts ≥ 30% in blood or bone marrow or extramedullary disease other than hepatosplenomegaly.  \n \nTreatment duration: In clinical trials, treatment with imatinib was continued until disease progression. The \neffect of stopping treatment after the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response has not been \ninvestigated.  \n \nDose increases from 600 mg to a maximum of 800 mg (given as 400 mg twice daily) in patients with blast \ncrisis may be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-leukaemia-related \nneutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease progression (at any time); failure to \nachieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least 3 months of treatment; failure to achieve a \ncytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss of a previously achieved haematological and/or \ncytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored closely following dose escalation given the potential for \nan increased incidence of adverse reactions at higher dosages.  \n \nPosology for CML in children \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily is \nrecommended for children with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML (not to exceed the total dose \nof 800 mg). Treatment can be given as a once daily dose or alternatively the daily dose may be split into two \nadministrations – one in the morning and one in the evening. The dose recommendation is currently based on \na small number of paediatric patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \nThere is no experience with the treatment of children below 2 years of age.  \n \nDose increases from 340 mg/m2 daily to 570 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed the total dose of 800 mg) may be \nconsidered in children in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-leukaemia-related \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nneutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease progression (at any time); failure to \nachieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least 3 months of treatment; failure to achieve a \ncytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss of a previously achieved haematological and/or \ncytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored closely following dose escalation given the potential for \nan increased incidence of adverse reactions at higher dosages. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in adult patients  \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 600 mg/day for adult patients with Ph+ ALL. \nHaematological experts in the management of this disease should supervise the therapy throughout all phases \nof care.  \n \nTreatment schedule: On the basis of the existing data, imatinib has been shown to be effective and safe when \nadministered at 600 mg/day in combination with chemotherapy in the induction phase, the consolidation and \nmaintenance phases of chemotherapy (see section 5.1) for adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. \nThe duration of imatinib therapy can vary with the treatment programme selected, but generally longer \nexposures to imatinib have yielded better results.  \n \nFor adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL imatinib monotherapy at 600 mg/day is safe, effective \nand can be given until disease progression occurs.  \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in children \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily is \nrecommended for children with Ph+ ALL (not to exceed the total dose of 600 mg).  \n \nPosology for MDS/MPD  \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 400 mg/day for adult patients with MDS/MPD.  \n \nTreatment duration: In the only clinical trial performed up to now, treatment with imatinib was continued \nuntil disease progression (see section 5.1). At the time of analysis, the treatment duration was a median of 47 \nmonths (24 days - 60 months).  \n \nPosology for HES/CEL  \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 100 mg/day for adult patients with HES/CEL.  \n \nDose increase from 100 mg to 400 mg may be considered in the absence of adverse drug reactions if \nassessments demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy.  \n \nTreatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit.  \n \nPosology for GIST \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 400 mg/day for adult patients with unresectable and/or \nmetastatic malignant GIST. \n \nLimited data exist on the effect of dose increases from 400 mg to 600 mg or 800 mg in patients progressing \nat the lower dose (see section 5.1). \n \nTreatment duration: In clinical trials in GIST patients, treatment with imatinib was continued until disease \nprogression. At the time of analysis, the treatment duration was a median of 7 months (7 days to 13 months). \nThe effect of stopping treatment after achieving a response has not been investigated. \n \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 400 mg/day for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients \nfollowing resection of GIST. Optimal treatment duration is not yet established. Length of treatment in the \nclinical trial supporting this indication was 36 months (see section 5.1). \n \nPosology for DFSP  \nThe recommended dose of Imatinib Teva B.V. is 800 mg/day for adult patients with DFSP. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nDose adjustment for adverse reactions \nNon-haematological adverse reactions \nIf a severe non-haematological adverse reaction develops with imatinib use, treatment must be withheld until \nthe event has resolved. Thereafter, treatment can be resumed as appropriate depending on the initial severity \nof the event. \n \nIf elevations in bilirubin > 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or in liver transaminases > 5 x \nIULN occur, imatinib should be withheld until bilirubin levels have returned to < 1.5 x IULN and \ntransaminase levels to < 2.5 x IULN. Treatment with imatinib may then be continued at a reduced daily dose. \nIn adults the dose should be reduced from 400 to 300 mg or from 600 to 400 mg, or from 800 mg to 600 mg, \nand in children from 340 to 260 mg/m2/day. \n \nHaematological adverse reactions \nDose reduction or treatment interruption for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are recommended as \nindicated in the table below. \n \nDose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: \n \nHES/CEL  \n(starting dose 100 mg) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/l  \nand/or  \nplatelets < 50 x 109/l \n\n1.

There is very limited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST \nand HES/CEL. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of imatinib in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL aged less than \n18 years of age have not been established in clinical trials. Currently available published data are \nsummarised in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nHepatic insufficiency: Imatinib is mainly metabolised through the liver. Patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere liver dysfunction should be given the minimum recommended dose of 400 mg daily. The dose can be \nreduced if not tolerated (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nLiver dysfunction classification: \n \nLiver dysfunction Liver function tests \nMild Total bilirubin: = 1.5 ULN \n\nAST: >ULN (can be normal or < ULN if total bilirubin is > ULN) \nModerate Total bilirubin: > 1.5-3.0 ULN \n\nAST: any \nSevere Total bilirubin: > 3-10 ULN \n\nAST: any \nULN = upper limit of normal for the institution \nAST = aspartate aminotransferase \n \nRenal insufficiency: Patients with renal dysfunction or on dialysis should be given the minimum \nrecommended dose of 400 mg daily as starting dose. However, in these patients caution is recommended. \nThe dose can be reduced if not tolerated. If tolerated, the dose can be increased for lack of efficacy (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nOlder people: Imatinib pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in older people. No significant \nage-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients in clinical trials which included \nover 20% of patients age 65 and older. No specific dose recommendation is necessary in older people. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen imatinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, there is a potential for drug interactions. \nCaution should be used when taking imatinib with protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, certain macrolides \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n(see section 4.5), CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclosporine, pimozide, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, terfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel, \nquinidine) or warfarin and other coumarin derivatives (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of imatinib and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John’s Wort) may \nsignificantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Therefore, \nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nHypothyroidism  \nClinical cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in thyroidectomy patients undergoing levothyroxine \nreplacement during treatment with imatinib (see section 4.5). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels \nshould be closely monitored in such patients. \n \nHepatotoxicity  \nMetabolism of imatinib is mainly hepatic, and only 13% of excretion is through the kidneys. In patients with \nhepatic dysfunction (mild, moderate or severe), peripheral blood counts and liver enzymes should be \ncarefully monitored (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). It should be noted that GIST patients may have hepatic \nmetastases which could lead to hepatic impairment. \n \nCases of liver injury, including hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis, have been observed with imatinib. When \nimatinib is combined with high dose chemotherapy regimens, an increase in serious hepatic reactions has \nbeen detected. Hepatic function should be carefully monitored in circumstances where imatinib is combined \nwith chemotherapy regimens also known to be associated with hepatic dysfunction (see section 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nFluid retention  \nOccurrences of severe fluid retention (pleural effusion, oedema, pulmonary oedema, ascites, superficial \noedema) have been reported in approximately 2.5% of newly diagnosed CML patients taking imatinib. \nTherefore, it is highly recommended that patients be weighed regularly. An unexpected rapid weight gain \nshould be carefully investigated and if necessary appropriate supportive care and therapeutic measures \nshould be undertaken. In clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of these events in older people and \nthose with a prior history of cardiac disease. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients with cardiac \ndysfunction. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease  \nPatients with cardiac disease, risk factors for cardiac failure or history of renal failure should be monitored \ncarefully, and any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac or renal failure should be evaluated \nand treated. \n \nIn patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with occult infiltration of HES cells within the \nmyocardium, isolated cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction have been associated with HES \ncell degranulation upon the initiation of imatinib therapy. The condition was reported to be reversible with \nthe administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily withholding imatinib. \nAs cardiac adverse events have been reported uncommonly with imatinib, a careful assessment of the \nbenefit/risk of imatinib therapy should be considered in the HES/CEL population before treatment initiation.  \n \nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases with PDGFR gene re-arrangements could be associated with \nhigh eosinophil levels. Evaluation by a cardiology specialist, performance of an echocardiogram and \ndetermination of serum troponin should therefore be considered in patients with HES/CEL, and in patients \nwith MDS/MPD associated with high eosinophil levels before imatinib is administered. If either is abnormal, \nfollow-up with a cardiology specialist and the prophylactic use of systemic steroids (1-2 mg/kg) for one to \ntwo weeks concomitantly with imatinib should be considered at the initiation of therapy. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, both gastrointestinal and intra-tumoural \nhaemorrhages were reported (see section 4.8). Based on the available data, no predisposing factors (e.g. \ntumour size, tumour location, coagulation disorders) have been identified that place patients with GIST at a \nhigher risk of either type of haemorrhage. Since increased vascularity and propensity for bleeding is a part of \nthe nature and clinical course of GIST, standard practices and procedures for the monitoring and \nmanagement of haemorrhage in all patients should be applied. \n \nIn addition, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), a rare cause of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, has been \nreported in post-marketing experience in patients with CML, ALL and other diseases (see section 4.8). When \nneeded, discontinuation of Imatinib Teva B.V. treatment may be considered. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome  \nDue to the possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), correction of clinically significant \ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of imatinib (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHepatitis B reactivation  \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these patients \nreceived BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or fulminant \nhepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. Experts in \nliver disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test positive for \nHBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. should be \nclosely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several \nmonths following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \nLaboratory tests \nComplete blood counts must be performed regularly during therapy with imatinib. Treatment of CML \npatients with imatinib has been associated with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. However, the occurrence \nof these cytopenias is likely to be related to the stage of the disease being treated and they were more \nfrequent in patients with accelerated phase CML or blast crisis as compared to patients with chronic phase \nCML. Treatment with imatinib may be interrupted or the dose may be reduced, as recommended in section \n4.2. \n \nLiver function (transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) should be monitored regularly in patients \nreceiving imatinib. \n \nIn patients with impaired renal function, imatinib plasma exposure seems to be higher than that in patients \nwith normal renal function, probably due to an elevated plasma level of alpha-acid glycoprotein (AGP), an \nimatinib-binding protein, in these patients. Patients with renal impairment should be given the minimum \nstarting dose. Patients with severe renal impairment should be treated with caution. The dose can be reduced \nif not tolerated (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nLong-term treatment with imatinib may be associated with a clinically significant decline in renal function. \nRenal function should, therefore, be evaluated prior to the start of imatinib therapy and closely monitored \nduring therapy, with particular attention to those patients exhibiting risk factors for renal dysfunction. If renal \ndysfunction is observed, appropriate management and treatment should be prescribed in accordance with \nstandard treatment guidelines. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere have been case reports of growth retardation occurring in children and pre-adolescents receiving \nimatinib. The long-term effects of prolonged treatment with imatinib on growth in children are unknown. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nTherefore, close monitoring of growth in children under imatinib treatment is recommended (see section \n4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations \nSubstances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors such as \nindinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; azole antifungals \nincluding ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole; certain macrolides such as erythromycin, \nclarithromycin and telithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There \nwas a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and \n40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a \nCYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 \nfamily. \n \nActive substances that may decrease imatinib plasma concentrations \nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nrifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John’s \nWort) may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. \nPretreatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted \nin decrease in Cmax and AUC(0-∞) by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin \ntreatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while \ntaking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and \nphenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. \nConcomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. \n \nActive substances that may have their plasma concentration altered by imatinib \nImatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, \nindicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering \nimatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclosporine, pimozide, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, terfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel and \nquinidine). Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs (e.g. triazolo-\nbenzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, i.e. \nstatins, etc.). \n \nBecause of known increased risks of bleeding in conjunction with the use of imatinib (e.g. haemorrhage), \npatients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight or standard heparin, instead of \ncoumarin derivatives such as warfarin. \n \nIn vitro imatinib inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 activity at concentrations similar to those \nthat affect CYP3A4 activity. Imatinib at 400 mg twice daily had an inhibitory effect on CYP2D6-mediated \nmetoprolol metabolism, with metoprolol Cmax and AUC being increased by approximately 23% (90%CI \n[1.16-1.30]). Dose adjustments do not seem to be necessary when imatinib is co-administrated with CYP2D6 \nsubstrates, however caution is advised for CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window such as \nmetoprolol. In patients treated with metoprolol clinical monitoring should be considered. \n \nIn vitro, imatinib inhibits paracetamol O-glucuronidation with Ki value of 58.5 micromol/l. This inhibition \nhas not been observed in vivo after the administration of imatinib 400 mg and paracetamol 1000 mg. Higher \ndoses of imatinib and paracetamol have not been studied. \n \nCaution should therefore be exercised when using high doses of imatinib and paracetamol concomitantly. \n \nIn thyroidectomy patients receiving levothyroxine, the plasma exposure to levothyroxine may be decreased \nwhen imatinib is co-administered (see section 4.4). Caution is therefore recommended. However, the \nmechanism of the observed interaction is presently unknown. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \nIn Ph+ ALL patients, there is clinical experience of co-administering imatinib with chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1), but drug-drug interactions between imatinib and chemotherapy regimens are not well \ncharacterised. Imatinib adverse events, i.e. hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression or others, may increase and it \nhas been reported that concomitant use with L-asparaginase could be associated with increased \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.8). Therefore, the use of imatinib in combination requires special precaution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data on the use of imatinib in pregnant women. There have been post-marketing reports of \nspontaneous abortions and infant congenital anomalies from women who have taken imatinib. Studies in \nanimals have however shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) and the potential risk for the foetus is \nunknown. Imatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If it is used during \npregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is limited information on imatinib distribution on human milk. Studies in two breast-feeding women \nrevealed that both imatinib and its active metabolite can be distributed into human milk. The milk plasma \nratio studied in a single patient was determined to be 0.5 for imatinib and 0.9 for the metabolite, suggesting \ngreater distribution of the metabolite into the milk. Considering the combined concentration of imatinib and \nthe metabolite and the maximum daily milk intake by infants, the total exposure would be expected to be low \n(~10% of a therapeutic dose). However, since the effects of low-dose exposure of the infant to imatinib are \nunknown, women taking imatinib should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \nIn non-clinical studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected (see section 5.3). Studies on \npatients receiving imatinib and its effect on fertility and gametogenesis have not been performed. Patients \nconcerned about their fertility on imatinib treatment should consult with their physician. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as dizziness, blurred vision or \nsomnolence during treatment with imatinib. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car \nor operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nPatients with advanced stages of malignancies may have numerous confounding medical conditions that \nmake causality of adverse reactions difficult to assess due to the variety of symptoms related to the \nunderlying disease, its progression, and the co-administration of numerous medicinal products. \n \nIn clinical trials in CML, drug discontinuation for drug-related adverse reactions was observed in 2.4% of \nnewly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in late chronic phase after failure of interferon therapy, 4% of \npatients in accelerated phase after failure of interferon therapy and 5% of blast crisis patients after failure of \ninterferon therapy. In GIST the study drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse reactions in 4% of \npatients. \n \nThe adverse reactions were similar in all indications, with two exceptions. There was more \nmyelosuppression seen in CML patients than in GIST, which is probably due to the underlying disease. In \nthe study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, 7 (5%) patients experienced CTC grade 3/4 \nGI bleeds (3 patients), intra-tumoural bleeds (3 patients) or both (1 patient). GI tumour sites may have been \nthe source of the GI bleeds (see section 4.4). GI and tumoural bleeding may be serious and sometimes fatal. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nThe most commonly reported (≥ 10%) drug-related adverse reactions in both settings were mild nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, muscle cramps and rash. Superficial oedemas were a \ncommon finding in all studies and were described primarily as periorbital or lower limb oedemas. However, \nthese oedemas were rarely severe and may be managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by \nreducing the dose of imatinib. \n \nWhen imatinib was combined with high dose chemotherapy in Ph+ ALL patients, transient liver toxicity in \nthe form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinaemia were observed. Considering the limited safety \ndatabase, the adverse events thus far reported in children are consistent with the known safety profile in adult \npatients with Ph+ ALL. The safety database for children with Ph+ALL is very limited though no new safety \nconcerns have been identified. \n \nMiscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and rapid weight gain \nwith or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as “fluid retention”. These reactions can \nusually be managed by withholding imatinib temporarily and with diuretics and other appropriate supportive \ncare measures. However, some of these reactions may be serious or life-threatening and several patients with \nblast crisis died with a complex clinical history of pleural effusion, congestive heart failure and renal failure. \nThere were no special safety findings in paediatric clinical trials. \n \nAdverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported as more than an isolated case are listed below, by system organ class and by \nfrequency. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000),

Because these reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always \npossible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to imatinib exposure. \n\n1  Pneumonia was reported most commonly in patients with transformed CML and in patients with \nGIST. \n\n2  Headache was the most common in GIST patients. \n3  On a patient-year basis, cardiac events including congestive heart failure were more commonly \n\nobserved in patients with transformed CML than in patients with chronic CML. \n4  Flushing was most common in GIST patients and bleeding (haematoma, haemorrhage) was most \n\ncommon in patients with GIST and with transformed CML (CML-AP and CML-BC). \n5  Pleural effusion was reported more commonly in patients with GIST and in patients with transformed \n\nCML (CML-AP and CML-BC) than in patients with chronic CML. \n6+7  Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were most commonly observed in GIST patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n8  Some fatal cases of hepatic failure and of hepatic necrosis have been reported. \n9. Musculoskeletal pain during treatment with imatinib or after discontinuation has been observed in \n\npost-marketing \n10  Musculoskeletal pain and related events were more commonly observed in patients with CML than in \n\nGIST patients. \n11 Fatal cases have been reported in patients with advanced disease, severe infections, severe neutropenia \n\nand other serious concomitant conditions. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities  \nHaematology  \nIn CML, cytopenias, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, have been a consistent finding in all \nstudies, with the suggestion of a higher frequency at high doses ≥ 750 mg (phase I study). However, the \noccurrence of cytopenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the frequency of grade 3 or \n4 neutropenias (ANC < 1.0 x 109/l) and thrombocytopenias (platelet count < 50 x 109/l) being between 4 and \n6 times higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase (59-64% and 44-63% for neutropenia and \nthrombocytopenia, respectively) as compared to newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase CML (16.7% \nneutropenia and 8.9% thrombocytopenia). In newly diagnosed chronic phase CML grade 4 neutropenia \n(ANC < 0.5 x 109/l) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 10 x 109/l) were observed in 3.6% and < 1% of \npatients, respectively. The median duration of the neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes usually \nranged from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 3 to 4 weeks, respectively. These events can usually be managed with \neither a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with imatinib, but can in rare cases lead to \npermanent discontinuation of treatment. In paediatric CML patients the most frequent toxicities observed \nwere grade 3 or 4 cytopenias involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. These generally occur \nwithin the first several months of therapy. \n \nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, grade 3 and 4 anaemia was reported in \n5.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively, and may have been related to gastrointestinal or intra-tumoural \nbleeding in at least some of these patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was seen in 7.5% and 2.7% of patients, \nrespectively, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 0.7% of patients. No patient developed grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia. The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts occurred mainly during \nthe first six weeks of therapy, with values remaining relatively stable thereafter. \n \nBiochemistry  \nSevere elevation of transaminases (<5%) or bilirubin (<1%) was seen in CML patients and was usually \nmanaged with dose reduction or interruption (the median duration of these episodes was approximately one \nweek). Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory abnormalities in less than 1% of \nCML patients. In GIST patients (study B2222), 6.8% of grade 3 or 4 ALT (alanine aminotransferase) \nelevations and 4.8% of grade 3 or 4 AST (aspartate aminotransferase) elevations were observed. Bilirubin \nelevation was below 3%. \n \nThere have been cases of cytolytic and cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic failure; in some of them outcome \nwas fatal, including one patient on high dose paracetamol. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions: \nHepatitis B reactivation \nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in acute \nhepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n44 \n \n\nExperience with doses higher than the recommended therapeutic dose is limited. Isolated cases of imatinib \noverdose have been reported spontaneously and in the literature. In the event of overdose the patient should \nbe observed and appropriate symptomatic treatment given. Generally the reported outcome in these cases \nwas “improved” or “recovered”. Events that have been reported at different dose ranges are as follows: \n \nAdult population \n1200 to 1600 mg (duration varying between 1 to 10 days): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, erythema, \noedema, swelling, fatigue, muscle spasms, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, abdominal pain, headache, \ndecreased appetite.  \n1800 to 3200 mg (as high as 3200 mg daily for 6 days): Weakness, myalgia, increased creatine \nphosphokinase, increased bilirubin, gastrointestinal pain.  \n6400 mg (single dose): One case reported in the literature of one patient who experienced nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, pyrexia, facial swelling, decreased neutrophil count, increased transaminases.  \n8 to 10 g (single dose): Vomiting and gastrointestinal pain have been reported. \n \nPaediatric population \nOne 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 400 mg experienced vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia and \nanother 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 980 mg experienced decreased white blood cell count \nand diarrhoea. \n \nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE01  \n \nMechanism of action \nImatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of the Bcr-Abl \ntyrosine kinase (TK), as well as several receptor TKs: Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) coded for \nby the c-Kit proto-oncogene, the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2), the colony stimulating \nfactor receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR-alpha and \nPDGFR-beta). Imatinib can also inhibit cellular events mediated by activation of these receptor kinases. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nImatinib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase at the in \nvitro, cellular and in vivo levels. The compound selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in \nBcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukaemic cells from Philadelphia chromosome positive CML and \nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. \n \nIn vivo the compound shows anti-tumour activity as a single agent in animal models using Bcr-Abl positive \ntumour cells. \n \nImatinib is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), \nPDGF-R, and stem cell factor (SCF), c-Kit, and inhibits PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular events. In vitro, \nimatinib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) cells, which \nexpress an activating kit mutation. Constitutive activation of the PDGF receptor or the Abl protein tyrosine \nkinases as a consequence of fusion to diverse partner proteins or constitutive production of PDGF have been \nimplicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/MPD, HES/CEL and DFSP. Imatinib inhibits signalling and \nproliferation of cells driven by dysregulated PDGFR and Abl kinase activity. \n \nClinical studies in chronic myeloid leukaemia \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nThe effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and \nprogression-free survival. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as \nimprovement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival. \n \nA large, international, open-label, non-controlled phase II study was conducted in patients with Philadelphia \nchromosome positive (Ph+) CML in the blast crisis phase of the disease. In addition, children have been \ntreated in two phase I studies and one phase II study. \n \nIn all clinical studies 38-40% of patients were ≥ 60 years of age and 10-12% of patients were ≥ 70 years of \nage. \n \nMyeloid blast crisis: 260 patients with myeloid blast crisis were enrolled. 95 (37%) had received prior \nchemotherapy for treatment of either accelerated phase or blast crisis (“pretreated patients”) whereas 165 \n(63%) had not (“untreated patients”). The first 37 patients were started at 400 mg, the protocol was \nsubsequently amended to allow higher dosing and the remaining 223 patients were started at 600 mg. \n \nThe primary efficacy variable was the rate of haematological response, reported as either complete \nhaematological response, no evidence of leukaemia (i.e. clearance of blasts from the marrow and the blood, \nbut without a full peripheral blood recovery as for complete responses), or return to chronic phase CML. In \nthis study, 31% of patients achieved a haematological response (36% in previously untreated patients and \n22% in previously treated patients). The rate of response was also higher in the patients treated at 600 mg \n(33%) as compared to the patients treated at 400 mg (16%, p=0.0220). The current estimate of the median \nsurvival of the previously untreated and treated patients was 7.7 and 4.7 months, respectively. \n \nLymphoid blast crisis: a limited number of patients were enrolled in phase I studies (n=10). The rate of \nhaematological response was 70% with a duration of 2-3 months. \n \nTable 2 Response in adult CML studies \n \n Study 0102 38-month data \n\nMyeloid blast crisis \n(n=260) \n\n % of patients (CI95%) \nHaematological response1  \n\nComplete haematological response (CHR) \n \n\nNo evidence of leukaemia (NEL) \n \nReturn to chronic phase (RTC)  \n\n31% (25.2-36.8) \n8% \n\n \n5% \n\n \n18% \n\nMajor cytogenetic response2  15% (11.2-20.4) \nComplete  7% \n(Confirmed3) [95% CI]  (2%) [0.6-4.4] \nPartial  8% \n\n1 Haematological response criteria (all responses to be confirmed after ≥ 4 weeks):  \nCHR: In study 0102 [ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, platelets ≥ 100 x 109/l, no blood blasts, BM blasts < 5% \nand no extramedullary disease]  \nNEL Same criteria as for CHR but ANC ≥ 1 x 109/l and platelets ≥ 20 x 109/l  \nRTC < 15% blasts BM and PB, < 30% blasts+promyelocytes in BM and PB, < 20% basophils in \nPB, no extramedullary disease other than spleen and liver.  \nBM = bone marrow, PB = peripheral blood  \n2 Cytogenetic response criteria:  \nA major response combines both complete and partial responses: complete (0% Ph+ metaphases), \npartial (1-35%)  \n3 Complete cytogenetic response confirmed by a second bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation \nperformed at least one month after the initial bone marrow study  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nPaediatric patients: A total of 26 paediatric patients of age < 18 years with either chronic phase CML (n=11) \nor CML in blast crisis or Ph+ acute leukaemias (n=15) were enrolled in a dose-escalation phase I trial. This \nwas a population of heavily pretreated patients, as 46% had received prior BMT and 73% a prior multi-agent \nchemotherapy. Patients were treated at doses of imatinib of 260 mg/m2/day (n=5), 340 mg/m2/day (n=9), 440 \nmg/m2/day (n=7) and 570 mg/m2/day (n=5). Out of 9 patients with chronic phase CML and cytogenetic data \navailable, 4 (44%) and 3 (33%) achieved a complete and partial cytogenetic response, respectively, for a rate \nof MCyR of 77%. \n \nA total of 51 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed and untreated CML in chronic phase have been \nenrolled in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II trial. Patients were treated with imatinib 340 \nmg/m2/day, with no interruptions in the absence of dose limiting toxicity. Imatinib treatment induces a rapid \nresponse in newly diagnosed paediatric CML patients with a CHR of 78% after 8 weeks of therapy. The high \nrate of CHR is accompanied by the development of a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) of 65% which \nis comparable to the results observed in adults. Additionally, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) was \nobserved in 16% for a MCyR of 81%. The majority of patients who achieved a CCyR developed the CCyR \nbetween months 3 and 10 with a median time to response based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5.6 months. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with imatinib in \nall subsets of the paediatric population in Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl translocation)-positive chronic \nmyeloid leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nClinical studies in Ph+ ALL \nNewly diagnosed Ph+ ALL: In a controlled study (ADE10) of imatinib versus chemotherapy induction in 55 \nnewly diagnosed patients aged 55 years and over, imatinib used as single agent induced a significantly higher \nrate of complete haematological response than chemotherapy (96.3% vs. 50%; p=0.0001). When salvage \ntherapy with imatinib was administered in patients who did not respond or who responded poorly to \nchemotherapy, it resulted in 9 patients (81.8%) out of 11 achieving a complete haematological response. This \nclinical effect was associated with a higher reduction in bcr-abl transcripts in the imatinib-treated patients \nthan in the chemotherapy arm after 2 weeks of therapy (p=0.02). All patients received imatinib and \nconsolidation chemotherapy (see Table 3) after induction and the levels of bcr-abl transcripts were identical \nin the two arms at 8 weeks. As expected on the basis of the study design, no difference was observed in \nremission duration, disease-free survival or overall survival, although patients with complete molecular \nresponse and remaining in minimal residual disease had a better outcome in terms of both remission duration \n(p=0.01) and disease-free survival (p=0.02). \n \nThe results observed in a population of 211 newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients in four uncontrolled clinical \nstudies (AAU02, ADE04, AJP01 and AUS01) are consistent with the results described above. Imatinib in \ncombination with chemotherapy induction (see Table 3) resulted in a complete haematological response rate \nof 93% (147 out of 158 evaluable patients) and in a major cytogenetic response rate of 90% (19 out of 21 \nevaluable patients). The complete molecular response rate was 48% (49 out of 102 evaluable patients). \nDisease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) constantly exceeded 1 year and were superior to \nhistorical control (DFS p<0.001; OS p<0.0001) in two studies (AJP01 and AUS01).  \n \nTable 3 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib \n \n\nStudy ADE10  \nPrephase  DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 1-5;  \n\nCP 200 mg/m2 i.v., days 3, 4, 5;  \nMTX 12 mg intrathecal, day 1  \n\nRemission induction  DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 6-7, 13-16; \nVCR 1 mg i.v., days 7, 14; \nIDA 8 mg/m2 i.v.

The estimated 4-year OS in cohort 5-patients was 83.6% compared to 44.8% in the \nhistorical controls. 20 out of the 50 (40%) patients in cohort 5 received haematopoietic stem cell transplant. \n \nTable 4 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib in study I2301 \n \nConsolidation block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nIfosfamide (1.8 g/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nMESNA (360 mg/m2/dose q3h, x 8 doses/day, IV): days 1-5 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 6-15 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nIT Methotrexate (age-adjusted): day 1 ONLY \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 8, 15 \n\nConsolidation block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: Days 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 1 \nARA-C (3 g/m2/dose q 12 h x 4, IV): days 2 and 3 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 4-13 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \n\nReinduction block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8, and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, IV): days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 1 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: Days 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nReinduction block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8 and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, iv): Days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 2 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: days 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycles 1–4 \n\nMTX (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 \ndoses)iii: days 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1, 29 \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 8-28 \nMethotrexate (20 mg/m2/week, PO): days 8, 15, 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nCPM (300 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nMESNA IV days 29-33 \nG-CSF (5 μg/kg, SC): days 34-43 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycle 5 \n\nCranial irradiation (Block 5 only) \n12 Gy in 8 fractions for all patients that are CNS1 and CNS2 at \ndiagnosis \n18 Gy in 10 fractions for patients that are CNS3 at diagnosis \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 11-56 (Withhold 6-MP during the 6-10 \ndays of cranial irradiation beginning on day 1 of Cycle 5.

Safety data from this study seem to be in \nline with the safety profile of imatinib in Ph+ ALL patients. \n \nRelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL: When imatinib was used as single agent in patients with relapsed/refractory \nPh+ ALL, it resulted, in the 53 out of 411 patients evaluable for response, in a haematological response rate \nof 30% (9% complete) and a major cytogenetic response rate of 23%. (Of note, out of the 411 patients, 353 \nwere treated in an expanded access program without primary response data collected.) The median time to \nprogression in the overall population of 411 patients with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL ranged from 2.6 to \n3.1 months, and median overall survival in the 401 evaluable patients ranged from 4.9 to 9 months. The data \nwas similar when re-analysed to include only those patients age 55 or older.  \n \nClinical studies in MDS/MPD \nExperience with imatinib in this indication is very limited and is based on haematological and cytogenetic \nresponse rates. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival. One open \nlabel, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing imatinib in diverse populations \nof patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with Abl, Kit or PDGFR protein tyrosine \nkinases. This study included 7 patients with MDS/MPD who were treated with imatinib 400 mg daily. Three \npatients presented a complete haematological response (CHR) and one patient experienced a partial \nhaematological response (PHR). At the time of the original analysis, three of the four patients with detected \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nPDGFR gene rearrangements developed haematological response (2 CHR and 1 PHR). The age of these \npatients ranged from 20 to 72 years. \n \nAn observational registry (study L2401) was conducted to collect long-term safety and efficacy data in \npatients suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms with PDGFR- β rearrangement and who were treated \nwith imatinib. The 23 patients enrolled in this registry received imatinib at a median daily dose of 264 mg \n(range: 100 to 400 mg) for a median duration of 7.2 years (range 0.1 to 12.7 years). Due to the observational \nnature of this registry, haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular assessment data were available for 22, 9 and \n17 of the 23 enrolled patients, respectively. When assuming conservatively that patients with missing data \nwere non-responders, CHR was observed in 20/23 (87%) patients, CCyR in 9/23 (39.1%) patients, and MR \nin 11/23 (47.8%) patients, respectively. When the response rate is calculated from patients with at least one \nvalid assessment, the response rate for CHR, CCyR and MR was 20/22 (90.9%), 9/9 (100%) and 11/17 \n(64.7%), respectively. \n \nIn addition a further 24 patients with MDS/MPD were reported in 13 publications. 21 patients were treated \nwith imatinib 400 mg daily, while the other 3 patients received lower doses. In eleven patients PDGFR gene \nrearrangements was detected, 9 of them achieved a CHR and 1 PHR. The age of these patients ranged from 2 \nto 79 years. In a recent publication updated information from 6 of these 11 patients revealed that all these \npatients remained in cytogenetic remission (range 32-38 months). The same publication reported long term \nfollow-up data from 12 MDS/MPD patients with PDGFR gene rearrangements (5 patients from study \nB2225). These patients received imatinib for a median of 47 months (range 24 days – 60 months). In 6 of \nthese patients follow-up now exceeds 4 years. Eleven patients achieved rapid CHR; ten had complete \nresolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and a decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by \nRT-PCR. Haematological and cytogenetic responses have been sustained for a median of 49 months (range \n19-60) and 47 months (range 16-59), respectively. The overall survival is 65 months since diagnosis (range \n25-234). Imatinib administration to patients without the genetic translocation generally results in no \nimprovement.  \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with MDS/MPD. Five (5) patients with MDS/MPD \nassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 4 publications. The age of these patients \nranged from 3 months to 4 years and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging from 92.5 to \n340 mg/m2 daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, cytogenetic response and/or \nclinical response. \n \nClinical studies in HES/CEL \nOne open-label, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing imatinib in diverse \npopulations of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with Abl, Kit or PDGFR protein \ntyrosine kinases. In this study, 14 patients with HES/CEL were treated with 100 mg to 1,000 mg of imatinib \ndaily. A further 162 patients with HES/CEL, reported in 35 published case reports and case series received \nimatinib at doses from 75 mg to 800 mg daily. Cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated in 117 of the total \npopulation of 176 patients. In 61 of these 117 patients FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase was identified. An \nadditional four HES patients were found to be FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive in other 3 published reports. All 65 \nFIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase positive patients achieved a CHR sustained for months (range from 1+ to \n44+ months censored at the time of the reporting). As reported in a recent publication 21 of these 65 patients \nalso achieved complete molecular remission with a median follow-up of 28 months (range 13-67 months). \nThe age of these patients ranged from 25 to 72 years. Additionally, improvements in symptomatology and \nother organ dysfunction abnormalities were reported by the investigators in the case reports. Improvements \nwere reported in cardiac, nervous, skin/subcutaneous tissue, respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal, \nmusculoskeletal/connective tissue/vascular, and gastrointestinal organ systems. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with HES/CEL. Three (3) patients with HES and CEL \nassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these patients \nranged from 2 to 16 years and imatinib was given at dose 300 mg/m2 daily or doses ranging from 200 to 400 \nmg daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, complete cytogenetic response and/or \ncomplete molecular response. \n \nClinical studies in unresectable and/or metastatic GIST \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nOne phase II, open-label, randomised, uncontrolled multinational study was conducted in patients with \nunresectable or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). In this study 147 patients were \nenrolled and randomised to receive either 400 mg or 600 mg orally once daily for up to 36 months. These \npatients ranged in age from 18 to 83 years old and had a pathologic diagnosis of Kit-positive malignant GIST \nthat was unresectable and/or metastatic. Immunohistochemistry was routinely performed with Kit antibody \n(A-4502, rabbit polyclonal antiserum, 1:100; DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) according to analysis by \nan avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method after antigen retrieval. \n \nThe primary evidence of efficacy was based on objective response rates. Tumours were required to be \nmeasurable in at least one site of disease, and response characterisation based on Southwestern Oncology \nGroup (SWOG) criteria. Results are provided in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 Best tumour response in trial STIB2222 (GIST) \n \n \n \n \nBest response \n\nAll doses (n=147) \n400 mg (n=73) \n600 mg (n=74) \n\nn (%) \nComplete response 1 (0.7) \nPartial response 98 (66.7) \nStable disease 23 (15.6) \nProgressive disease 18 (12.2) \nNot evaluable 5 (3.4) \nUnknown 2 (1.4) \n \nThere were no differences in response rates between the two dose groups. A significant number of patients \nwho had stable disease at the time of the interim analysis achieved a partial response with longer treatment \n(median follow-up 31 months). Median time to response was 13 weeks (95% C.I. 12–23). Median time to \ntreatment failure in responders was 122 weeks (95% C.I 106–147), while in the overall study population it \nwas 84 weeks (95% C.I 71–109). The median overall survival has not been reached. The Kaplan-Meier \nestimate for survival after 36-month follow-up is 68%. \n \nIn two clinical studies (study B2222 and an intergroup study S0033) the daily dose of imatinib was escalated \nto 800 mg in patients progressing at the lower daily doses of 400 mg or 600 mg. The daily dose was \nescalated to 800 mg in a total of 103 patients; 6 patients achieved a partial response and 21 stabilisation of \ntheir disease after dose escalation for an overall clinical benefit of 26%. From the safety data available, \nescalating the dose to 800 mg daily in patients progressing at lower doses of 400 mg or 600 mg daily does \nnot seem to affect the safety profile of imatinib. \n \nClinical studies in adjuvant GIST \nIn the adjuvant setting, imatinib was investigated in a multicentre, double-blind, long-term, placebo-\ncontrolled phase III study (Z9001) involving 773 patients. The ages of these patients ranged from 18 to 91 \nyears. Patients were included who had a histological diagnosis of primary GIST expressing Kit protein by \nimmunochemistry and a tumour size ≥ 3 cm in maximum dimension, with complete gross resection of \nprimary GIST within 14-70 days prior to registration. After resection of primary GIST, patients were \nrandomised to one of the two arms: imatinib at 400 mg/day or matching placebo for one year. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from date of \nrandomisation to the date of recurrence or death from any cause. \n \nImatinib significantly prolonged RFS, with 75% of patients being recurrence-free at 38 months in the \nimatinib group vs. 20 months in the placebo group (95% CIs, [30 - non-estimable]; [14 - non- estimable], \nrespectively); (hazard ratio = 0.398 [0.259-0.610], p<0.0001). At one year the overall RFS was significantly \nbetter for imatinib (97.7%) vs. placebo (82.3%), (p<0.0001). The risk of recurrence was thus reduced by \napproximately 89% as compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0.113 [0.049-0.264]). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nThe risk of recurrence in patients after surgery of their primary GIST was retrospectively assessed based on \nthe following prognostic factors: tumour size, mitotic index, tumour location. Mitotic index data were \navailable for 556 of the 713 intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The results of subgroup analyses according \nto the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) \nrisk classifications are shown in Table 6.

There were a total of 397 patients consented and randomised to the study (199 patients \non 12-month arm and 198 patients on 36-month arm), median age was 61 years (range 22 to 84 years). The \nmedian time of follow-up was 54 months (from date of randomisation to data cut-off), with a total of 83 \nmonths between the first patient randomised and the cut-off date. \n  \nThe primary endpoint of the study was recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from date of \nrandomisation to the date of recurrence or death from any cause. \n \nThirty-six (36) months of imatinib treatment significantly prolonged RFS compared to 12 months of imatinib \ntreatment (with overall Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.46 [0.32, 0.65], p<0.0001) (Table 7, Figure 1). \n \nIn addition, thirty-six (36) months of imatinib treatment significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) \ncompared to 12 months of imatinib treatment (HR = 0.45 [0.22, 0.89], p=0.0187) (Table 7, Figure 2). \n \nLonger duration of the treatment (> 36 months) may delay the onset of further recurrences; however the \nimpact of this finding on the overall survival remains unknown. \n \nThe total number of deaths were 25 for the 12-month treatment arm and 12 for the 36-month treatment arm. \n \nTreatment with imatinib for 36 months was superior to treatment for 12 months in the ITT analysis, i.e. \nincluding the entire study population. In a planned subgroup analysis by mutation type, the HR for RFS for \n36 months of treatment for patients with mutations of exon 11 was 0.35 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.56]. No \nconclusions can be drawn for other less common mutation subgroups due to the low number of observed \nevents. \n \nTable 7 12-month and 36-month imatinib treatment (SSGXVIII/AIO Trial) \n \n \nRFS \n\n12-month treatment arm \n% (CI) \n\n36-month treatment arm \n% (CI) \n\n12 months 93.7 (89.2-96.4) 95.9 (91.9-97.9) \n24 months 75.4 (68.6-81.0) 90.7 (85.6-94.0) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n36 months 60.1 (52.5-66.9) 86.6 (80.8-90.8) \n48 months 52.3 (44.0-59.8) 78.3 (70.8-84.1) \n60 months 47.9 (39.0-56.3) 65.6 (56.1-73.4) \n\nSurvival   \n36 months 94.0 (89.5-96.7) 96.3 (92.4-98.2) \n48 months 87.9 (81.1-92.3) 95.6 (91.2-97.8) \n60 months 81.7 (73.0-87.8) 92.0 (85.3-95.7) \n\n \nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier estimates for primary recurrence-free survival endpoint (ITT population) \n \n\n \n \nFigure 2 Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall survival (ITT population) \n \n\n \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with c-Kit positive GIST.

The age of the DFSP patients ranged from 23 to 75 years; DFSP \nwas metastatic, locally recurrent following initial resective surgery and not considered amenable to further \nresective surgery at the time of study entry. The primary evidence of efficacy was based on objective \nresponse rates. Out of the 12 patients enrolled, 9 responded, one completely and 8 partially. Three of the \npartial responders were subsequently rendered disease free by surgery. The median duration of therapy in \nstudy B2225 was 6.2 months, with a maximum duration of 24.3 months. A further 6 DFSP patients treated \nwith imatinib were reported in 5 published case reports, their ages ranging from 18 months to 49 years. The \nadult patients reported in the published literature were treated with either 400 mg (4 cases) or 800 mg (1 \ncase) imatinib daily. Five (5) patients responded, 3 completely and 2 partially. The median duration of \ntherapy in the published literature ranged between 4 weeks and more than 20 months. The translocation \nt(17:22)[(q22:q13)], or its gene product, was present in nearly all responders to imatinib treatment. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with DFSP. Five (5) patients with DFSP and PDGFR \ngene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these patients ranged from newborn to 14 \nyears and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging from 400 to 520 mg/m2 daily. All patients \nachieved partial and/or complete response. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetics of imatinib \nThe pharmacokinetics of imatinib have been evaluated over a dosage range of 25 to 1,000 mg. Plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles were analysed on day 1 and on either day 7 or day 28, by which time plasma \nconcentrations had reached steady state. \n \nAbsorption \nMean absolute bioavailability for the capsule formulation is 98%. There was high between-patient variability \nin plasma imatinib AUC levels after an oral dose. When given with a high-fat meal, the rate of absorption of \nimatinib was minimally reduced (11% decrease in Cmax and prolongation of tmax by 1.5 h), with a small \nreduction in AUC (7.4%) compared to fasting conditions. The effect of prior gastrointestinal surgery on drug \nabsorption has not been investigated. \n \nDistribution \nAt clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 95% on the \nbasis of in vitro experiments, mostly to albumin and alpha-acid-glycoprotein, with little binding to \nlipoprotein.  \n \nBiotransformation \nThe main circulating metabolite in humans is the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, which shows similar \nin vitro potency to the parent. The plasma AUC for this metabolite was found to be only 16% of the AUC for \nimatinib. The plasma protein binding of the N-demethylated metabolite is similar to that of the parent \ncompound. \n \nImatinib and the N-demethyl metabolite together accounted for about 65% of the circulating radioactivity \n(AUC(0-48h)). The remaining circulating radioactivity consisted of a number of minor metabolites. \n \nThe in vitro results showed that CYP3A4 was the major human P450 enzyme catalysing the \nbiotransformation of imatinib. Of a panel of potential comedications (acetaminophen, aciclovir, allopurinol, \namphotericin, cytarabine, erythromycin, fluconazole, hydroxyurea, norfloxacin, penicillin V) only \nerythromycin (IC50 50 μM) and fluconazole (IC50 118 μM) showed inhibition of imatinib metabolism which \ncould have clinical relevance. \n \nImatinib was shown in vitro to be a competitive inhibitor of marker substrates for CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4/5. Ki values in human liver microsomes were 27, 7.5 and 7.9 µmol/l, respectively. Maximal plasma \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nconcentrations of imatinib in patients are 2-4 µmol/l, consequently an inhibition of CYP2D6 and/or \nCYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism of co-administered drugs is possible. Imatinib did not interfere with the \nbiotransformation of 5-fluorouracil, but it inhibited paclitaxel metabolism as a result of competitive \ninhibition of CYP2C8 (Ki = 34.7 μM). This K i value is far higher than the expected plasma levels of \nimatinib in patients; consequently no interaction is expected upon co-administration of either 5-fluorouracil \nor paclitaxel and imatinib. \n \nElimination \nBased on the recovery of compound(s) after an oral 14C-labelled dose of imatinib, approximately 81% of the \ndose was recovered within 7 days in faeces (68% of dose) and urine (13% of dose). Unchanged imatinib \naccounted for 25% of the dose (5% urine, 20% faeces), the remainder being metabolites. \n \nPlasma pharmacokinetics \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the t½ was approximately 18 h, suggesting that once-\ndaily dosing is appropriate. The increase in mean AUC with increasing dose was linear and dose proportional \nin the range of 25-1,000 mg imatinib after oral administration. There was no change in the kinetics of \nimatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation was 1.5-2.5-fold at steady state when dosed once daily. \n \nPharmacokinetics in GIST patients \nIn patients with GIST steady-state exposure was 1.5-fold higher than that observed for CML patients for the \nsame dosage (400 mg daily). Based on preliminary population pharmacokinetic analysis in GIST patients, \nthere were three variables (albumin, WBC and bilirubin) found to have a statistically significant relationship \nwith imatinib pharmacokinetics. Decreased values of albumin caused a reduced clearance (CL/f); and higher \nlevels of WBC led to a reduction of CL/f. However, these associations are not sufficiently pronounced to \nwarrant dose adjustment. In this patient population, the presence of hepatic metastases could potentially lead \nto hepatic insufficiency and reduced metabolism. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis in CML patients, there was a small effect of age on the \nvolume of distribution (12% increase in patients > 65 years old). This change is not thought to be clinically \nsignificant. The effect of bodyweight on the clearance of imatinib is such that for a patient weighing 50 kg \nthe mean clearance is expected to be 8.5 l/h, while for a patient weighing 100 kg the clearance will rise to \n11.8 l/h. These changes are not considered sufficient to warrant dose adjustment based on kg bodyweight. \nThere is no effect of gender on the kinetics of imatinib. \n \nPharmacokinetics in children \nAs in adult patients, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in paediatric patients in both \nphase I and phase II studies. Dosing in children at 260 and 340 mg/m2/day achieved the same exposure, \nrespectively, as doses of 400 mg and 600 mg in adult patients. The comparison of AUC(0-24) on day 8 and day \n1 at the 340 mg/m2/day dose level revealed a 1.7-fold drug accumulation after repeated once-daily dosing. \n \nBased on pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis in paediatric patients with haematological disorders \n(CML, Ph+ALL, or other haematological disorders treated with imatinib), clearance of imatinib increases \nwith increasing body surface area (BSA). After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics such as \nage, body weight and body mass index did not have clinically significant effects on the exposure of imatinib. \nThe analysis confirmed that exposure of imatinib in paediatric patients receiving 260 mg/m2 once daily (not \nexceeding 400 mg once daily) or 340 mg/m2 once daily (not exceeding 600 mg once daily) were similar to \nthose in adult patients who received imatinib 400 mg or 600 mg once daily. \n \nOrgan function impairment \nImatinib and its metabolites are not excreted via the kidney to a significant extent. Patients with mild and \nmoderate impairment of renal function appear to have a higher plasma exposure than patients with normal \nrenal function. The increase is approximately 1.5- to 2-fold, corresponding to a 1.5-fold elevation of plasma \nAGP, to which imatinib binds strongly. The free drug clearance of imatinib is probably similar between \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n56 \n \n\npatients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function, since renal excretion represents only a \nminor elimination pathway for imatinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nAlthough the results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is considerable inter-subject variation, \nthe mean exposure to imatinib did not increase in patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction as \ncompared to patients with normal liver function (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of imatinib was assessed in rats, dogs, monkeys and rabbits. \n \nMultiple dose toxicity studies revealed mild to moderate haematological changes in rats, dogs and monkeys, \naccompanied by bone marrow changes in rats and dogs. \n \nThe liver was a target organ in rats and dogs. Mild to moderate increases in transaminases and slight \ndecreases in cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein and albumin levels were observed in both species. No \nhistopathological changes were seen in rat liver. Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated for 2 \nweeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct hyperplasia. \n \nRenal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralisation and dilation of the \nrenal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were observed in \nseveral of these animals. In rats, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium in the renal papilla and in the \nurinary bladder was observed at doses ≥ 6 mg/kg in the 13-week study, without changes in serum or urinary \nparameters. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed with chronic imatinib treatment. \n \nIn a 39-week monkey study, no NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) was established at the lowest \ndose of 15 mg/kg, approximately one-third the maximum human dose of 800 mg based on body surface. \nTreatment resulted in worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these animals. \n \nImatinib was not considered genotoxic when tested in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test), an in vitro \nmammalian cell assay (mouse lymphoma) and an in vivo rat micronucleus test. Positive genotoxic effects \nwere obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster ovary) for clastogenicity \n(chromosome aberration) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two intermediates of the manufacturing \nprocess, which are also present in the final product, are positive for mutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of \nthese intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma assay. \n \nIn a study of fertility, in male rats dosed for 70 days prior to mating, testicular and epididymal weights and \npercent motile sperm were decreased at 60 mg/kg, approximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 \nmg/day, based on body surface area. This was not seen at doses ≤ 20 mg/kg. A slight to moderate reduction \nin spermatogenesis was also observed in the dog at oral doses ≥ 30 mg/kg. When female rats were dosed 14 \ndays prior to mating and through to gestational day 6, there was no effect on mating or on number of \npregnant females. At a dose of 60 mg/kg, female rats had significant post-implantation foetal loss and a \nreduced number of live foetuses. This was not seen at doses ≤ 20 mg/kg. \n \nIn an oral pre- and postnatal development study in rats, red vaginal discharge was noted in the 45 mg/kg/day \ngroup on either day 14 or day 15 of gestation. At the same dose, the number of stillborn pups as well as those \ndying between postpartum days 0 and 4 was increased. In the F1 offspring, at the same dose level, mean \nbody weights were reduced from birth until terminal sacrifice and the number of litters achieving criterion \nfor preputial separation was slightly decreased. F1 fertility was not affected, while an increased number of \nresorptions and a decreased number of viable foetuses was noted at 45 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect \nlevel (NOEL) for both the maternal animals and the F1 generation was 15 mg/kg/day (one quarter of the \nmaximum human dose of 800 mg). \n \nImatinib was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg, \napproximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day, based on body surface area. Teratogenic \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n57 \n \n\neffects included exencephaly or encephalocele, absent/reduced frontal and absent parietal bones. These \neffects were not seen at doses ≤ 30 mg/kg. \n \nNo new target organs were identified in the rat juvenile development toxicology study (day 10 to 70 \npostpartum) with respect to the known target organs in adult rats. In the juvenile toxicology study, effects \nupon growth, delay in vaginal opening and preputial separation were observed at approximately 0.3 to 2 \ntimes the average paediatric exposure at the highest recommended dose of 340 mg/m2. In addition, mortality \nwas observed in juvenile animals (around weaning phase) at approximately 2 times the average paediatric \nexposure at the highest recommended dose of 340 mg/m2. \n \nIn the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study administration of imatinib at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day resulted in a \nstatistically significant reduction in the longevity of males at 60 mg/kg/day and females at ≥30 mg/kg/day. \nHistopathological examination of decedents revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), chronic progressive \nnephropathy (females) and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death or reasons for sacrifice. \nTarget organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys, urinary bladder, urethra, preputial and clitoral gland, \nsmall intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands and non-glandular stomach. \n \nPapilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland were noted from 30 mg/kg/day onwards, representing \napproximately 0.5 or 0.3 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, \nrespectively, and 0.4 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2/day. The no \nobserved effect level (NOEL) was 15 mg/kg/day. The renal adenoma/carcinoma, the urinary bladder and \nurethra papilloma, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, the parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and \nmalignant medullary tumours of the adrenal glands and the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas \nwere noted at 60 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 1.7 or 1 times the human daily exposure (based on \nAUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, respectively, and 1.2 times the daily exposure in children (based on \nAUC) at 340 mg/m2/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) was 30 mg/kg/day. \n \nThe mechanism and relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans are not yet \nclarified. \n \nNon-neoplastic lesions not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, pancreas, \nendocrine organs and teeth. The most important changes included cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, leading \nto signs of cardiac insufficiency in some animals. \n \nThe active substance imatinib demonstrates an environmental risk for sediment organisms. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Teva B.V. is and what it is used for  \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of cancer. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells \n\nusually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which \ncertain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Teva B.V. is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Teva B.V. can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \nImatinib Teva is also a treatment for adults and children for:  \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). Leukaemia \n\nis a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight infection. Acute \nlymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal white cells (named \nlymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells.  \n\n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood diseases in \n\nwhich some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these \ncells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These are \nblood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. Imatinib \nTeva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). GIST is a cancer of the stomach and bowels. It arises \nfrom uncontrolled cell growth of the supporting tissues of these organs. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin in \nwhich some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Teva B.V. works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, ask your doctor.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor’s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information contained in \nthis leaflet.  \n \nDo not take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V.:  \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem.  \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed.  \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Teva B.V. \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V., tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Teva B.V. may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention).  \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Teva B.V. your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is working. \nYou will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with CML \nbelow 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very limited \nexperience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Teva B.V. may have slower than normal growth. The doctor \nwill monitor the growth at regular visits.  \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Teva B.V. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including herbal medicines \n(such as St. John’s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V. when taken \ntogether. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V., either leading to increased side \neffects or making Imatinib Teva B.V. less effective. Imatinib Teva B.V. may do the same to some other \nmedicines.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n- Imatinib Teva B.V. is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby.

How to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Teva B.V. because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib Teva \nB.V. can help you to fight this condition.  \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important that \nyou do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are \nnot sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Teva B.V. unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor straight \naway.  \n \nHow much Imatinib Teva B.V. to take  \n \nUse in adults  \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Imatinib Teva B.V. to take.  \n \n- If you are being treated for CML:  \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 tablets once a day. \n \n- If you are being treated for GIST: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 4 tablets once a day. \n \nFor CML and GIST, your doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to the \ntreatment. If your daily dose is 800 mg (8 tablets), you should take 4 tablets in the morning and 4 tablets in \nthe evening. \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 tablets once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD:  \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 4 tablets once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one tablet once a day. Your doctor may decide to increase \nthe dose to 400 mg, to be taken as 4 tablets once a day, depending on how you respond to treatment.  \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (8 tablets), to be taken as 4 tablets in the morning and 4 tablets in the \nevening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many tablets of Imatinib Teva B.V. to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Teva B.V. given will depend on your child’s condition, body weight and height. The total daily \ndose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The treatment can either be \ngiven to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be split into two administrations \n(half in the morning and half in the evening).  \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n- Take Imatinib Teva B.V. with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- Swallow the tablets whole with a large glass of water.  \n \nIf you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can dissolve them in a glass of still water or apple juice:  \n• Use about 50 ml for each 100 mg tablet.  \n• Stir with a spoon until the tablets have completely dissolved.  \n• Once the tablet has dissolved, drink everything in the glass straight away. Traces of the dissolved \n\ntablets may be left behind in the glass.  \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nHow long to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \nKeep taking Imatinib Teva B.V. every day for as long as your doctor tells you.  \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Teva B.V. than you should  \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require medical \nattention. Take the medicine pack with you.  \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next dose, \n\nskip the missed dose.  \n- Then continue with your normal schedule.  \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Teva B.V. is and what it is used for  \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of cancer. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells \n\nusually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which \ncertain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n \n\nIn adult patients, Imatinib Teva B.V. is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Teva B.V. can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \nImatinib Teva is also a treatment for adults and children for:  \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). Leukaemia \n\nis a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight infection. Acute \nlymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal white cells (named \nlymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells.  \n\n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood diseases in \n\nwhich some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these \ncells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These are \nblood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. Imatinib \nTeva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n- Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). GIST is a cancer of the stomach and bowels. It arises \nfrom uncontrolled cell growth of the supporting tissues of these organs. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin in \nwhich some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Teva B.V. works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, ask your doctor.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor’s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information contained in \nthis leaflet.  \n \nDo not take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V.:  \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem.  \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed.  \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Teva B.V. \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V., tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Teva B.V. may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention).  \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Teva B.V. your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is working. \nYou will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with CML \nbelow 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very limited \nexperience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Teva B.V. may have slower than normal growth. The doctor \nwill monitor the growth at regular visits.  \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Teva B.V. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including herbal medicines \n(such as St. John’s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V. when taken \ntogether. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V., either leading to increased side \neffects or making Imatinib Teva B.V. less effective. Imatinib Teva B.V. may do the same to some other \nmedicines.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n- Imatinib Teva B.V. is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Teva B.V. during \npregnancy.  \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during treatment.  \n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Teva B.V. are advised to consult \n\nwith their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not drive \nor use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again.  \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Teva B.V. because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib Teva \nB.V. can help you to fight this condition.  \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important that \nyou do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are \nnot sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Teva B.V. unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor straight \naway.  \n \nHow much Imatinib Teva B.V. to take  \n \nUse in adults  \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Imatinib Teva B.V. to take.  \n \n- If you are being treated for CML: \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one tablet of 400 mg plus 2 tablets of 100 mg once a \nday. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for GIST: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as one tablet once a day. \n \nFor CML and GIST, your doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to the \ntreatment. If your daily dose is 800 mg (2 tablets), you should take one tablet in the morning and a second \ntablet in the evening.  \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one tablet of 400 mg plus 2 tablets of 100 mg once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD:  \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as one tablet once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one tablet of 100 mg once a day. Your doctor may decide \nto increase the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as one tablet of 400 mg once a day, depending on how you \nrespond to treatment. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n- If you are being treated for DFSP:  \nThe dose is 800 mg per day (2 tablets), to be taken as one tablet in the morning and a second tablet in \nthe evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many tablets of Imatinib Teva B.V. to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Teva B.V. given will depend on your child’s condition, body weight and height. The total daily \ndose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The treatment can either be \ngiven to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be split into two administrations \n(half in the morning and half in the evening).  \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n- Take Imatinib Teva B.V. with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- Swallow the tablets whole with a large glass of water.  \n \nIf you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can dissolve them in a glass of still water or apple juice:  \n• Use about 200 ml for each 400 mg tablet.  \n• Stir with a spoon until the tablets have completely dissolved.  \n• Once the tablet has dissolved, drink everything in the glass straight away. Traces of the dissolved \n\ntablets may be left behind in the glass.  \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nHow long to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \nKeep taking Imatinib Teva B.V. every day for as long as your doctor tells you.  \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Teva B.V. than you should  \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require medical \nattention. Take the medicine pack with you.  \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next dose, \n\nskip the missed dose.  \n- Then continue with your normal schedule.  \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information. \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Teva B.V. is and what it is used for  \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of cancer. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells \n\nusually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which \ncertain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n \n\nIn adult patients, Imatinib Teva B.V. is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Teva B.V. can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \nImatinib Teva is also a treatment for adults and children for:  \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). Leukaemia \n\nis a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight infection. Acute \nlymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal white cells (named \nlymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells.  \n\n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood diseases in \n\nwhich some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these \ncells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These are \nblood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. Imatinib \nTeva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n- Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). GIST is a cancer of the stomach and bowels. It arises \nfrom uncontrolled cell growth of the supporting tissues of these organs. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin in \nwhich some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells.  \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Teva B.V. works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, ask your doctor.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours.  \n \nFollow all your doctor’s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information contained in \nthis leaflet.  \n \nDo not take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V.:  \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem.  \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed.  \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Teva B.V. \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V., tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Teva B.V. may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention).  \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Teva B.V. your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is working. \nYou will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with CML \nbelow 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very limited \nexperience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Teva B.V. may have slower than normal growth. The doctor \nwill monitor the growth at regular visits.  \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Teva B.V. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including herbal medicines \n(such as St. John’s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V. when taken \ntogether. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V., either leading to increased side \neffects or making Imatinib Teva B.V. less effective. Imatinib Teva B.V. may do the same to some other \nmedicines.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n- Imatinib Teva B.V. is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Teva B.V. during \npregnancy.  \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during treatment.  \n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Teva B.V. are advised to consult \n\nwith their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not drive \nor use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again.  \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Teva B.V. because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib Teva \nB.V. can help you to fight this condition.  \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important that \nyou do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are \nnot sure.  \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Teva B.V. unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor straight \naway.  \n \nHow much Imatinib Teva B.V. to take  \n \nUse in adults  \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules of Imatinib Teva B.V. to take.  \n \n- If you are being treated for CML:  \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 capsules once a day. \n \n\n- If you are being treated for GIST: \nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day. \n\n \nFor CML and GIST, your doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to \ntreatment. If your daily dose is 800 mg (8 capsules), you should take 4 capsules in the morning and 4 \ncapsules in the evening. \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 capsules once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD:  \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one capsule once a day. Your doctor may decide to \nincrease the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day, depending on how you respond to \ntreatment.  \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (8 capsules), to be taken as 4 capsules in the morning and 4 capsules in the \nevening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many capsules of Imatinib Teva B.V. to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Teva B.V. given will depend on your child’s condition, body weight and height. The total daily \ndose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The treatment can either be \ngiven to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be split into two administrations \n(half in the morning and half in the evening).  \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n- Take Imatinib Teva B.V. with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n- Swallow the capsules whole with a large glass of water.

You should \nwash your hands immediately after opening the capsules.  \n\n \nHow long to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \nKeep taking Imatinib Teva B.V. every day for as long as your doctor tells you.  \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Teva B.V. than you should  \nIf you have accidentally taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require \nmedical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next dose, \n\nskip the missed dose.  \n- Then continue with your normal schedule.  \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information. \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Teva B.V. is and what it is used for  \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of cancer. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is a treatment for: \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells \n\nusually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which \ncertain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Teva B.V. is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Teva B.V. can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \nImatinib Teva is also a treatment for adults and children for:  \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). Leukaemia \n\nis a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight infection. Acute \nlymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal white cells (named \nlymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells.  \n\n \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for adults for: \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood diseases in \n\nwhich some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these \ncells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These are \nblood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. Imatinib \nTeva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n- Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). GIST is a cancer of the stomach and bowels. It arises \nfrom uncontrolled cell growth of the supporting tissues of these organs. \n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin in \nwhich some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Teva B.V. inhibits the growth of these cells.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n107 \n \n\nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Teva B.V. works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, ask your doctor.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nImatinib Teva B.V. will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours.  \n \nFollow all your doctor’s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information contained in \nthis leaflet.  \n \nDo not take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V.:  \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem.  \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed.  \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Teva B.V. \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V., tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Teva B.V. may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention).  \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Teva B.V. your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is working. \nYou will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nImatinib Teva B.V. is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with CML \nbelow 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very limited \nexperience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Teva B.V. may have slower than normal growth. The doctor \nwill monitor the growth at regular visits.  \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Teva B.V. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including herbal medicines \n(such as St. John’s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V. when taken \ntogether. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Teva B.V., either leading to increased side \neffects or making Imatinib Teva B.V. less effective. Imatinib Teva B.V. may do the same to some other \nmedicines.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\n- Imatinib Teva B.V. is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Teva B.V. during \npregnancy.  \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during treatment.  \n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Teva B.V. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Teva B.V. are advised to consult \n\nwith their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not drive \nor use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again.  \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Teva B.V. because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib Teva \nB.V. can help you to fight this condition.  \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important that \nyou do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are \nnot sure.  \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Teva B.V. unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor straight \naway.  \n \nHow much Imatinib Teva B.V. to take  \n \nUse in adults  \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules of Imatinib Teva B.V. to take.  \n \n- If you are being treated for CML:  \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one capsule of 400 mg plus 2 capsules of 100 mg \nonce a day. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for GIST: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as one capsule once a day. \n \nFor CML and GIST, your doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to \ntreatment. If your daily dose is 800 mg (2 capsules), you should take one capsule in the morning and a \nsecond capsule in the evening.  \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one capsule of 400 mg plus 2 capsules of 100 mg once a \nday.  \n\n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD:  \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as one capsule once a day.  \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL:  \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one capsule of 100 mg once a day. Your doctor may decide \nto increase the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as one capsule of 400 mg once a day, depending on how \nyou respond to treatment. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n109 \n \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (2 capsules), to be taken as one capsule in the morning and a second \ncapsule in the evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many capsules of Imatinib Teva B.V. to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Teva B.V. given will depend on your child’s condition, body weight and height. The total daily \ndose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The treatment can either be \ngiven to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be split into two administrations \n(half in the morning and half in the evening).  \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n- Take Imatinib Teva B.V. with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Teva B.V.  \n- Swallow the capsules whole with a large glass of water.

You should \nwash your hands immediately after opening the capsules.  \n\n \nHow long to take Imatinib Teva B.V. \nKeep taking Imatinib Teva B.V. every day for as long as your doctor tells you.  \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Teva B.V. than you should  \nIf you have accidentally taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away.
