CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPancreatic enzyme replacement treatment in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other \nconditions (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, post pancreatectomy or pancreatic cancer). \n \nEnzepi is indicated in infants, children, adolescents and adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe dosage of Enzepi should be individualised based on clinical symptoms, the degree of steatorrhoea \npresent, the fat content of the diet, or actual body weight. Therapy should be initiated at the lowest \nrecommended dose and gradually increased under medical supervision with careful monitoring of the \npatient\u2019s response and symptoms. Patients should be instructed not to increase the dosage on their own. \nChanges in dosage may require an adjustment period of several days. \n \nMaximum recommended dose \nThe maximum recommended total dose is 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or 10,000 lipase \nunits/kg of body weight per day), or 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested per day. Higher doses should be used \nwith caution if warranted (see sections 4.4 and 4.9) and only if they are documented to be effective by 3day \nfaecal fat measurements that indicate a significantly improved coefficient of fat absorption. \nFor each snack, half of the prescribed Enzepi dose for a full meal should be given. Enzyme doses expressed \nas lipase units/kg of body weight per meal must be reduced in older patients because they tend to ingest less \nfat per kilogram of body weight. \n \nIt is important to ensure adequate hydration of patients at all times whilst dosing Enzepi. Inadequate \nhydration may predispose to/or aggravate constipation. \n \nStarting dose \nPaediatric population below 1 year of age \nFor infants below 1 year of age the recommended starting dose is 5,000 lipase units per meal (generally \n120 ml of milk) (see section Method of administration). \n \nPaediatric population between 1 and less than 4 years of age  \nFor children between 1 and less than 4 years of age the recommended starting dose is 1,000 lipase units/kg of \nbody weight per meal. \n \nPaediatric population aged 4 years or older and adults (including elderly) \nFor children aged 4 years or older, adolescents and adults the recommended starting dose is 500 lipase \nunits/kg of body weight per meal. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4  \n\nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \nEnzepi should be taken during meals or snacks, with a drink of water or juice.  \nCapsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed. Crushing, chewing, or mixing capsule \ncontents with food or fluid with a pH greater than 5 or storing the food mixture (see below), can lead to a \ndisruption of the protective gastro-resistant coating. This can result in early release of the enzymes in the oral \ncavity, irritation of the mucous membranes and may lead to loss of enzyme activity. \n \nPatients unable to swallow capsules whole \nFor patients who are unable to swallow capsules whole, the capsules may be carefully opened and the \ncontents mixed (without crushing) with small amounts of acidic soft food of pH 5 or less (e.g., fruit puree \n[apple/ pear], yoghurt, juice [orange/pineapple/apple]). Do not mix with water, milk, breast-milk, formula, \nflavoured milk or hot food. The Enzepi soft food mixture should be swallowed immediately without chewing \nand followed with water or juice to ensure complete ingestion. Care should be taken to ensure that Enzepi is \nnot retained in the mouth. The mixture must not be stored. \n \nPaediatric population \nFor paediatric patients below 1 year of age, Enzepi must be administered immediately prior to each feed. \nThe capsule should be carefully opened to empty the content (granules). The granules may be administered \nwith a small amount of appropriate acidic food or directly into the mouth. Administration should be followed \nby breast-milk or formula to ensure complete ingestion. The contents of the capsule should not be mixed \ndirectly into formula or breast-milk as this may diminish efficacy. Care should be taken to ensure that Enzepi \nis not crushed or chewed or retained in the mouth, to avoid irritation of the oral mucosa. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFibrosing colonopathy \nStrictures of the ileo-caecum and large bowel (fibrosing colonopathy) have been reported in patients with \ncystic fibrosis taking high doses of pancreatin preparations. As a precaution, unusual abdominal symptoms \nor changes in abdominal symptoms should be medically assessed to exclude the possibility of fibrosing \ncolonopathy, especially if the patient is taking in excess of 10,000  lipase units/kg/day. \n\n \nAnaphylactic reactions \nRarely, anaphylactic reactions have been reported with pancreatic enzyme products with different \nformulations of the same active ingredient (pancreas powder). If this reaction occurs, patients should be \nadvised to discontinue treatment immediately and seek urgent medical assistance.  \n \nPotential for hyperuricaemia  \nCaution must be exercised when prescribing Enzepi to patients with a history of gout, renal impairment, or \nhyperuricaemia. Porcine derived pancreatic enzyme products contain purines that may increase blood uric \nacid levels. \n \nPotential for irritation to oral mucosa \nCare should be taken to ensure that no medicinal product is retained in the mouth. Enzepi should not be \ncrushed or chewed or mixed in foods having a pH greater than 5. These actions can disrupt the protective \ngastro-resistant coating resulting in early release of enzymes, irritation of oral mucosa, and/or loss of enzyme \nactivity (see section 4.2). \n \nAbnormal blood glucose levels \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5  \n\nConsideration should be given to blood glucose monitoring in patients at risk of abnormal blood glucose \nlevels as glycaemic control may be affected by administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy \n(see section 4.8). \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially `sodium-free\u00b4. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \nPancreatic enzyme medicinal products do not cause pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions \nbased on their pharmacology, as they are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No clinically relevant \ninteractions are expected. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. It is also not known \nwhether this medicinal product can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect \nreproduction capacity. Although, no preclinical investigations were carried out with Enzepi there is no \nevidence for any absorption of this medicinal product. Therefore, no reproductive or developmental toxicity \nis to be expected. The risk and benefit of this medicinal product should be considered in the context of the \nneed to provide adequate nutritional support to a pregnant woman with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. \nAdequate caloric intake during pregnancy is important for normal maternal weight gain and foetal growth. \nReduced maternal weight gain and malnutrition can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether this medicinal product is excreted in human milk. Nevertheless, undersirable effects \non the breastfed newborn/infant are not anticipated since systemic exposure in breast-feeding women to the \npancreatic enzymes present in Enzepi is not expected. \n \nAs a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded, a decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from Enzepi therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding \nfor the child and the benefit of continued Enzepi therapy for the breastfeeding woman. \n \nFertility \nNo human data on the effect of Enzepi on fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEnzepi has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most important serious adverse reactions observed with pancreatic enzyme medicinal products  are \nanaphylactic reactions (see section 4.4) and fibrosing colonopathy (see section 4.4). \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported with Enzepi were gastrointestinal complaints [abdominal pain \n(16%); flatulence (12%); abdominal distention (7%); diarrhoea and vomiting (6%); constipation (5%); \nnausea (3%)], and headache occurring in approximately 6% of patients. In clinical trials, most of them were \nmild to moderate in severity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions associated with pancreas powder obtained from clinical studies, post-marketing \nsurveillance and some additional class effects are tabulated below.

Cases of blood glucose fluctuations have been \nreported with Enzepi, most of them non-serious and recovered after diabetic treatment adjustment. \n \nThe most relevant class effects of the pancreatic enzyme products include fibrosing colonopathy, \nhyperuricaemia/ hyperuricosuria and anaphylactic reactions. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7  \n\n \nPaediatric population \nIn clinical trials, 110 children with CF (cystic fibrosis) aged 1 month and older received Enzepi at a dose that \nensured stabilization of symptoms. The safety profile of Enzepi in the paediatric population was similar to \nthat observed in adults. \n \nElderly people \nNo specific adverse reactions were identified in the elderly population. Frequency, type and severity of \nadverse reactions were similar in elderly people with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency as compared to \nadults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nChronic high doses of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and as a \nresult in some cases colonic strictures (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). High doses of pancreatic enzyme products \nhave been associated with hyperuricosuria and hyperuricaemia, and should be used with caution in patients \nwith a history of gout, renal impairment or hyperuricaemia (see section 4.4). Supportive measures including \nstopping pancreatic enzyme therapy and ensuring adequate rehydration are recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Digestives, incl. enzymes, Enzyme preparations,  ATC code: A09AA02 \n \nMechanism of action \nEnzepi belongs to the family of pancreatic enzyme products and contains a defined amount of lipase, \namylase and protease that have been extracted from porcine pancreas and purified using a process designed \nto inactivate viruses. \n \nGastro-resistant granules are thoroughly mixed with chyme when the capsule dissolves in the stomach, \nwithout inactivating the acid-sensitive enzymes. It is only in the duodenum, which has a different \nenvironment with a pH value greater than 5, that these digestive enzymes are released from the granules. \nThen, enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglycerides, glycerol, and free fatty acids, protein into \npeptides and amino acids, and starch into dextrins and short chain sugars such as maltose and maltotriose in \nthe duodenum and proximal small intestine, thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted \nby the pancreas. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of Enzepi has been evaluated in one active-comparator study and one placebo-controlled study \nconducted in 130 patients with EPI (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) associated with CF. Moreover three \nsupportive studies were conducted in 34 paediatric patients. \n \nData generated in the CF population with EPI can be extrapolated to the other causes of EPI such as chronic \npancreatitis, post pancreatectomy or pancreatic cancer. \n \nStudy PR-005 \nThe pivotal study PR-005 was conducted in Europe. It was a randomized, double-blind, active controlled, \ntwo-treatment, crossover study, comparing Enzepi to standard pancreatic enzyme treatment during \n2 treatments periods. During the first treatment period, patients received either Enzepi or the comparator for \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8  \n\n28 days, followed by a cross-over to the alternate treatment for a second 28 day period. For both treatment \nperiods, patients received a dose as close as possible to their stabilized existing pancreatic enzyme product \ndose on the first day. Then, starting on the second day, the dose of assigned treatment could be changed \n(titrated up and/or titrated down) to stabilize the symptoms of EPI. Stabilization of the symptoms had to be \nobtained before the end of the first 14 days of each treatment period. \n \nA total of 96 patients, aged 12 to 43 years, were randomized in the intent-to-treat population. During the \nstudy, patients were instructed to consume 100 g (\u00b1 15 g) of fat per day and to maintain a consistent dietary \nfat intake for meals and snacks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the coefficient of fat absorption over \n72 hours (CFA-72h) which was calculated at the end of each treatment period, from the stools collected \nduring the last 3 days of each treatment period. The collection was performed in an approved, controlled \nenvironment that enabled supervised dietary intake and quantitative stool collection. \n \nSubjects achieved a mean CFA-72h of 84.08 with Enzepi and of 85.33 with comparator. The difference in \nmeans was -1.25 (95% CI, -3.62 to 1.12), with p=0.2972. Thus, Enzepi demonstrated both non-inferiority \nand equivalence to the comparator in fat absorption control (measured as CFA-72h) in adolescents and adults \nwith CF-associated EPI. \n\nTable 1 Analysis of coefficient of fat absorption over 72 hours (CFA72h) \u2013 completers \npopulation (study : PR005) \n\n \n\nVariable \nstatistic \n\nEnzepi \n(N=83) \n\nStandard treatment \n(N=83) \n\nSummary statistics \n Mean (SD) \n Median (minimum \u2013 maximum) \n\n \n84.11 (11.073) \n85.92 (47.4 \u2013 99.5) \n\n \n85.34 (9.099) \n86.49 (53.5 \u2013 97.3) \n\nModel-based statistics (Enzepi minus Creon) \n LS mean (standard error) \n\n \n84.08 (1.109) \n\n \n85.33 (1.109) \n\n Difference in LS means (95% confidence limits) \n \n p-value \n\n                        -1.25 (-3.62, 1.12) \n \n\n                                 0.2972 \n \nN: number of patients; SD: standard deviation; LS: least squares. \nModel-based statistics are from a mixed effects linear model using CFA-72h as the response variable, fixed effect factors for \ntreatment, period and treatment sequence, and subject within treatment sequence as a random effect. \n \nStudy EUR-1008-M  \nThe supportive EUR-1008-M, conducted in the US, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \ncrossover study of 34 patients, ages 7 to 23 years, with EPI due to CF. Patients were randomized to receive \nEnzepi or matching placebo for 6 to 7 days of treatment, followed by cross-over to the alternate treatment for \nan additional 6 to 7 days. All patients consumed a high-fat diet (greater than or equal to 100 grams of fat per \nday) during the treatment period. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA-72h) \nbetween Enzepi and placebo treatment. The CFA-72h was determined by a 72-hour stool collection during \nboth treatments, when both fat excretion and fat ingestion were measured. Each patient\u2019s CFA-72h during \nplacebo treatment was used as their no-treatment CFA-72h value. \n \nMean CFA-72h was 88% with Enzepi treatment compared to 63% with placebo treatment. The mean \ndifference in CFA-72h was 26 percentage points greater with Enzepi treatment with a 95% Confidence \nInterval of (19, 32) and p<0.001. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9  \n\nThe short-term efficacy and safety of Enzepi were assessed in clinical studies in paediatric patients, ages 1 to \n17 years, with EPI due to CF. \n \nStudy  EUR-1008-M  \nEUR-1008-M was conducted in 34 patients with EPI due to CF, 26 of whom were children, including 8 \nchildren aged 7 to 11 years, and 18 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Results are presented above.  \nThe safety and efficacy in the paediatric patients in this study was similar to the adult patients.  \n \nStudy EUR 1009-M \nEUR 1009-M was an open-label, single arm study in 19 patients, ages 1 to 6 years, with EPI due to CF. \nApproximately half of the patients were ages 1 to 3 years. Patients were transitioned to Enzepi from their \nusual PEP (pancreatic enzyme product) treatment. After a 4-14 days screening period on their usual PEP, \npatients received Enzepi at individually titrated doses ranging between 2,300 and 10,000 lipase units per kg \nbody weight per day, with a mean of approximately 5,000 lipase units per kg body weight per day (not to \nexceed 2,500 lipase units per kilogram per meal) for 14 days. There was no wash-out period.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of \u201cresponders\u201d, defined as those patients without \nsteatorrhoea (<30% faecal fat content) and without signs and symptoms of malabsorption after one and two \nweeks of treatment with Enzepi. Steatorrhoea was assessed from the faecal fat content measured by spot \nfaecal fat testing on Days 11 and 18 compared with baseline (under usual PEPs).  \n \nThe number of responders (patients with less than 30% faecal fat content and without signs and symptoms of \nmalabsorption) at baseline was 10/19 (52.6%), 13/19 (68.4%) after 1 week of treatment (stabilization) and \n11/19 (57.9%) after the second week of open-label treatment with Enzepi. The mean faecal fat content was \nsimilar at baseline (24.8%), after stabilization (27.0%) and after the second week of open-label treatment \n(27.3%). \n \nStudy PR-011  \nStudy PR-011 was an open-label crossover study in 15 patients, ages 1 to 11 months, with EPI due to CF. \nPatients were randomized to receive Enzepi from an opened capsule mixed and administered with apple \njuice (in a syringe nurser) or apple sauce (using a spoon) for 10 days of treatment, followed by a cross-over \nto the alternate mode of administration  for an additional 10 days.  \n \nThe primary objective was to assess the acceptability of 2 modes of administration using an acceptability \nquestionnaire that was completed by the caregiver. Twelve patients completed both assigned treatment arms \nand were evaluated. Overall, caregivers were satisfied with using apple sauce as a dosing method compared \nwith apple juice. \n \nStudy PR-018 \nStudy PR-018 was a 12-month open-label extension of Study PR-011. Patients were administered Enzepi at \nthe same dose they were taking at the end of Study PR-011. The dose of Enzepi was adjusted during the 12-\nmonth study as the patient\u2019s grew and gained weight. \n \nTwelve patients completed the study. Overall, an improvement was observed from baseline to study \ncompletion for growth indices including weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length percentiles. \n \nElderly people \nClinical studies of Enzepi did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine \nwhether they respond different from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified \ndifferences in responses between the elderly and young patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pancreatic enzymes in Enzepi are gastro-resistant to minimise destruction or inactivation in gastric acid. \nEnzepi is designed to release most of the enzymes in vivo at pH greater than 5.5. Pancreatic enzymes are not \nabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10  \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo preclinical investigations were carried out with Enzepi. However as pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract, no systemic toxicity is expected following oral administration of pancreas \npowder. \n \n \n6.

What Enzepi is and what it is used for \n \nEnzepi is a pancreatic enzyme replacement medicine for people whose bodies do not make enough of \nenzymes to digest food. \n \nEnzepi contains a mixture of  natural digestive enzymes which are used to digest food. These include lipases \nfor digesting fat, proteases for digesting protein and amylases for digestions carbohydrates. The enzymes are \ntaken from pig pancreas glands. \n \nEnzepi is for use by adults, adolescents, children and infants with \u2018exocrine pancreatic insufficiency\u2019, a \ncondition that makes the body less able to break down and digest food. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Enzepi \n \nDo not take Enzepi \n - if you are allergic to the active subtance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Enzepi \n\ufffd if you have ever had gout, kidney disease, or high uric acid levels in your blood (hyperuricaemia) or in \n\nurine (hyperuricosuria), \n\ufffd if you have abnormal blood glucose levels.  \n\n \nCystic fibrosis patients \nA rare bowel condition called \u2018fibrosing colonopathy\u2019, where the intestine is narrowed, has been reported in \npatients with cystic fibrosis taking high doses of pancreatic enzymes. If you have cystic fibrosis and you are \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34  \n\ntaking pancreatic enzymes exceeding10,000 lipase units per kilogram body weight per day and have unusual \nabdominal symptoms (such as severe stomach pain, trouble passing stools, nausea or vomiting) or changes in \nabdominal symptoms, tell your doctor straightaway. \n \nSevere allergic reaction  \nIf an allergic reaction occurs, stop your treatment and talk to your doctor. An allergic reaction could include \nitching, hives or rash. Rarely, a more serious allergic reaction may include a feeling of warmth, dizziness and \nfainting, trouble breathing; these are symptoms of a severe, potentially life-threatening condition called \n\u2018anaphylactic shock\u2019. If this occurs, call for urgent medical attention straightaway. \n \nMouth irritation \nEnzepi capsules or its contents should not be crushed or chewed as they can cause irritation inside your \nmouth. Enzepi can only be sprinkled on certain food (see section 3). \n \nOther medicines and Enzepi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, or if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are \nplanning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIt is not known if Enzepi passes into your breast-milk. You and your doctor should decide if you will take \nEnzepi or breast-feed. \n \nIt is not known if Enzepi will affect your ability to get pregnant or if it harms your unborn baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEnzepi does not affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Enzepi \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nThe dose is measured in \u2018lipase units\u2019.   \n \nYour doctor will adjust your dose which will depend on: \n\n\ufffd the severity of your illness, \n\ufffd how much fat is in your stools, \n\ufffd your diet, \n\ufffd your weight. \n\n \nHow much Enzepi to take \nInfants (below 1 year of age) \nThe recommended starting dose for infants below 1 year of age is 5,000 lipase units per 120 ml of formula \nmilk or breast-milk. \n \nChildren (between 1 and 4 years of age) \nThe recommended starting dose for children between 1 and 4 years of age is 1,000 lipase units per kg of \nbody weight with each meal. \n \nChildren (over 4 years of age), adolescents and adults (including elderly) \nThe recommended starting dose for children over 4 years of age, adolescents (12 to 18 years) and adults is \n500 lipase units per kg of body weight per meal. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35  \n\nIf your doctor advises you to increase the number of capsules you take each day, you should do so slowly \nover several days. If you still have fatty stools (smelly, loose, oily, pale stools) or other stomach or gut \nproblems (gastrointestinal symptoms), talk to your doctor as your dose may need to be adjusted again. \n \nDo not take more capsules in a day than the amount your doctor has told you (total daily dose). Depending \non what strength of Enzepi you take, your doctor will tell you how many capsules you need to take with each \nmeal or snack. \n \nYour total daily dose should not exceed 2,500 lipase units per kg of body weight per meal (or 10,000 lipase \nunits per kg of body weight per day). \n \n \nHow to take Enzepi \nChildren (over 1 year of age), adolescents and adults \nEnzepi should always be taken with a meal or snack. The capsules should be swallowed whole and take them \nwith a drink of water or juice. If you or your child eat a lot of meals or snacks in a day, be careful not to go \nover your total daily dose of Enzepi. \n \nIf you or your child have trouble swallowing Enzepi capsules, open carefully the capsules and sprinkle the \ncontents (granules) on a small amount of acidic food such as fruit puree (apple/ pear), yoghurt, or juice \n(orange/pineapple/apple). Do not mix the Enzepi granules with water, milk, breast-milk, formula feeds, \nflavoured milk or hot food. Ask your doctor about other foods you can sprinkle Enzepi granules on. \n \nIf you sprinkle the Enzepi granules on food, swallow the mixture or give it to your child straight after you \nhave mixed it, followed by a drink of water or juice. Make sure the medicine and food mixture is swallowed \ncompletely and that no granules are left in your or your child\u2019s mouth. \n \nDo not store Enzepi that has been sprinkled on food. \n \nEnzepi capsules or the granules inside them should not be crushed or chewed and the capsules or the \ngranules inside them should not be held in your or your child\u2019s mouth. Crushing, chewing or holding the \nEnzepi capsules in your or your child\u2019s mouth may cause irritation in your or your child\u2019s mouth or change \nthe way Enzepi works in your or your child\u2019s body. \n \nInfants (below 1 year of age) \nFor infants below 1 year of age, give Enzepi just before each feed of formula or breast-milk. Do not sprinkle \nthe capsule contents directly into the formula or breast-milk. Carefully open the capsule and empty the \ngranules on a small amount of acidic food (see above). If you sprinkle the Enzepi granules on food, give the \nmedicine and food mixture to your child right away and do not store Enzepi that is sprinkled on food. Your \nchild should take all the food mixture and should then drink enough liquid straight after to wash down all the \nmedicine. \n \nYou may also sprinkle the granules directly into your child\u2019s mouth. Immediately give them milk, formula or \nbreast-milk to drink to ensure the granules are completely swallowed and none remain in your child\u2019s mouth. \n \nLook into your child\u2019s mouth to make sure that all the medicine has been swallowed. \n \nIf you take more Enzepi than you should \nIf you take more Enzepi than you should drink plenty of water and talk to your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Enzepi \nDo not take a double dose or extra capsules to make up for a forgotten dose. Wait until your next meal, and \ntake your usual number of capsules with your meal. \n \nIf you stop taking Enzepi \nKeep taking your medicine until your doctor tells you to stop. Many patients will need to take pancreatic \nenzyme replacement medicines for the rest of their life. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36  \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most important serious side effects seen with other pancreatic enzyme replacement medicines are \n\u2018anaphylactic shock\u2019 and fibrosing colonopathy. The frequency of these two side effects is not known. \nAnaphylactic shock is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly. If you \nnotice any of the following seek urgent medical attention straightaway: \n\n\ufffd itching, hives or rash \n\ufffd swollen eyes, lips, hands or feet \n\ufffd feeling lightheaded or faint \n\ufffd trouble breathing or swallowing  \n\ufffd dizziness, collapse or unconsciousness. \n\n \nRepeated high doses of pancreatic enzyme replacement medicines can also cause scarring or thickening of \nthe bowel wall that can lead to blockage of the intestines, a condition called fibrosing colonopathy. If you \nhave severe stomach pain, trouble passing stools (constipation), nausea or vomiting, tell your doctor \nstraightaway.  \n \nOther possible side effects may include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\ufffd stomach pain.  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\ufffd abdominal discomfort or bloating \n\ufffd flatulence/passing wind \n\ufffd diarrhoea \n\ufffd headache. \n\n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\n\ufffd abnormal/discoloured faeces (stools) or frequent bowel movements \n\ufffd shortness of breath \n\ufffd indigestion \n\ufffd swelling, pain, soreness or irritation in the mouth \n\ufffd tiredness or general feeling of being unwell (malaise) \n\ufffd changes (increase or decrease) in blood glucose levels  \n\ufffd changes (increase or decrease) in body weight  \n\ufffd decreased appetite \n\ufffd high uric acid level in the urine (hyperuricosuria) \n\ufffd high uric acid level in the blood (hyperuricemia). \n\n \n If you are diabetic, you should speak with your doctor, if you notice any changes in your blood glucose \nlevels. A dose adjustment may be necessary.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37  \n\n5.

you are not sure. the dose is measured in 'lipase units'. your doctor will adjust your dose which will depend on: the severity of your illness, how much fat is in your stools, your diet, your weight. how much enzepi to take infants (below 1 year of age) the recommended starting dose for infants below 1 year of age is 5,000 lipase units per 120 ml of formula milk or breast-milk. children (between 1 and 4 years of age) the recommended starting dose for children between 1 and 4 years of age is 1,000 lipase units per kg of body weight with each meal. children (over 4 years of age), adolescents and adults (including elderly) the recommended starting dose for children over 4 years of age, adolescents (12 to 18 years) and adults is 500 lipase units per kg of body weight per meal. if your doctor advises you to increase the number of capsules you take each day, you should do so slowly over several days. if you still have fatty stools (smelly, loose, oily, pale stools) or other stomach or gut problems (gastrointestinal symptoms), talk to your doctor as your dose may need to be adjusted again. do not take more capsules in a day than the amount your doctor has told you (total daily dose). depending on what strength of enzepi you take, your doctor will tell you how many capsules you need to take with each meal or snack. your total daily dose should not exceed 2,500 lipase units per kg of body weight per meal (or 10,000 lipase units per kg of body weight per day). how to take enzepi children (over 1 year of age), adolescents and adults enzepi should always be taken with a meal or snack. the capsules should be swallowed whole and take them with a drink of water or juice. if you or your child eat a lot of meals or snacks in a day, be careful not to go over your total daily dose of enzepi. if you or your child have trouble swallowing enzepi capsules, open carefully the capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) on a small amount of acidic food such as fruit puree (apple/ pear), yoghurt, or juice (orange/pineapple/apple). do not mix the enzepi granules with water, milk, breast-milk, formula feeds, flavoured milk or hot food. ask your doctor about other foods you can sprinkle enzepi granules on. if you sprinkle the enzepi granules on food, swallow the mixture or give it to your child straight after you have mixed it, followed by a drink of water or juice. make sure the medicine and food mixture is swallowed completely and that no granules are left in your or your child's mouth. do not store enzepi that has been sprinkled on food. enzepi capsules or the granules inside them should not be crushed or chewed and the capsules or the granules inside them should not be held in your or your child's mouth. crushing, chewing or holding the enzepi capsules in your or your child's mouth may cause irritation in your or your child's mouth or change the way enzepi works in your or your child's body. infants (below 1 year of age) for infants below 1 year of age, give enzepi just before each feed of formula or breast-milk. do not sprinkle the capsule contents directly into the formula or breast-milk. carefully open the capsule and empty the granules on a small amount of acidic food (see above). if you sprinkle the enzepi granules on food, give the medicine and food mixture to your child right away and do not store enzepi that is sprinkled on food. your child should take all the food mixture and should then drink enough liquid straight after to wash down all the medicine. you may also sprinkle the granules directly into your child's mouth. immediately give them milk, formula or breast-milk to drink to ensure the granules are completely swallowed and none remain in your child's mouth. look into your child's mouth to make sure that all the medicine has been swallowed. if you take more enzepi than you should if you take more enzepi than you should drink plenty of water and talk to your doctor as soon as possible. if you forget to take enzepi do not take a double dose or extra capsules to make up for a forgotten dose. wait until your next meal, and take your usual number of capsules with your meal. if you stop taking enzepi

cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. the most important serious side effects seen with other pancreatic enzyme replacement medicines are 'anaphylactic shock' and fibrosing colonopathy. the frequency of these two side effects is not known. anaphylactic shock is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly. if you notice any of the following seek urgent medical attention straightaway: itching, hives or rash swollen eyes, lips, hands or feet feeling lightheaded or faint trouble breathing or swallowing dizziness, collapse or unconsciousness. repeated high doses of pancreatic enzyme replacement medicines can also cause scarring or thickening of the bowel wall that can lead to blockage of the intestines, a condition called fibrosing colonopathy. if you have severe stomach pain, trouble passing stools (constipation), nausea or vomiting, tell your doctor straightaway. other possible side effects may include: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): stomach pain. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): abdominal discomfort or bloating flatulence/passing wind diarrhoea headache. not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): abnormal/discoloured faeces (stools) or frequent bowel movements shortness of breath indigestion swelling, pain, soreness or irritation in the mouth tiredness or general feeling of being unwell (malaise) changes (increase or decrease) in blood glucose levels changes (increase or decrease) in body weight decreased appetite high uric acid level in the urine (hyperuricosuria) high uric acid level in the blood (hyperuricemia). if you are diabetic, you should speak with your doctor, if you notice any changes in your blood glucose levels. a dose adjustment may be necessary. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition":
