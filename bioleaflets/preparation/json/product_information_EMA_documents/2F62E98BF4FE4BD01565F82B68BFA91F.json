This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTalzenna 0.25 mg hard capsules  \nTalzenna 1 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nTalzenna 0.25 mg hard capsules \n \nEach hard capsule contains talazoparib tosylate equivalent to 0.25 mg talazoparib. \n \nTalzenna 1 mg hard capsules \n \nEach hard capsule contains talazoparib tosylate equivalent to 1 mg talazoparib. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nTalzenna 0.25 mg hard capsules \n \nOpaque, approximately 14.30 mm x 5.32 mm hard capsule with an ivory cap (printed with “Pfizer” in \nblack) and a white body (printed with “TLZ 0.25” in black). \n \nTalzenna 1 mg hard capsules \n \nOpaque, approximately 14.30 mm x 5.32 mm hard capsule with a light red cap (printed with “Pfizer” \nin black) and a white body (printed with “TLZ 1” in black). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTalzenna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline \nBRCA1/2-mutations, who have HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients \nshould have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant, locally \nadvanced or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments (see section 5.1). \nPatients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a prior \nendocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine-based therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Talzenna should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients should be selected for the treatment of breast cancer with Talzenna based on the presence of \ndeleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations determined by an experienced \nlaboratory using a validated test method.  \n \nGenetic counselling for patients with BRCA mutations should be performed according to local \nregulations, as applicable. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg talazoparib once daily. Patients should be treated until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  \n \nMissing dose \nIf the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed dose \nshould be taken at the usual time.  \n \nDose adjustments \nTo manage adverse drug reactions, interruption of treatment or dose reduction based on severity and \nclinical presentation should be considered (Table 2). Recommended dose reductions are indicated in \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1. Dose adjustments for toxicities \n\n Dose level \nRecommended starting dose 1 mg (one 1 mg capsule) once daily\nFirst dose reduction 0.75 mg (three 0.25 mg capsules) once daily \nSecond dose reduction 0.5 mg (two 0.25 mg capsules) once daily\nThird dose reduction 0.25 mg (one 0.25 mg capsule) once daily \n\n \nComplete blood count should be obtained prior to starting Talzenna therapy and monitored monthly \nand as clinically indicated (see Table 2 and section 4.4).  \n \nTable 2. Dose modification and management \n\n Withhold Talzenna until \nlevels resolve to \n\nResume Talzenna \n\nHaemoglobin < 8 g/dL  ≥ 9 g/dL \nResume Talzenna at next \nlower dose \n\nPlatelet count < 50,000/μL  ≥ 75,000/μL \nNeutrophil count < 1,000/μL ≥ 1,500/µL \n\nNon-haematologic adverse \nreaction Grade 3 or Grade 4  Grade 1 \n\nConsider resuming Talzenna \nat next lower dose or \ndiscontinue \n\n \nConcomitant treatment with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \nStrong inhibitors of P-gp may lead to increased talazoparib exposure. Concomitant use of strong P-gp \ninhibitors during treatment with talazoparib should be avoided. Co-administration should only be \nconsidered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If co-administration with a \nstrong P-gp inhibitor is unavoidable, the Talzenna dose should be reduced to the next lower dose. \nWhen the strong P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, the Talzenna dose should be increased (after \n3‐5 half-lives of the P-gp inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong P-gp inhibitor \n(see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1 × upper \nlimit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to \n1.5 × ULN and any AST). Talzenna has not been studied in patients with moderate \n\n\n\n4 \n\n(total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \n> 3.0 × ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2). Talzenna may only be used in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk, and the patient should be carefully \nmonitored for hepatic function and adverse events.  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min ≤ creatinine \nclearance [CrCL] < 90 mL/min). For patients with moderate renal impairment \n(30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), the recommended starting dose of Talzenna is 0.75 mg once daily. \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (15 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 30 mL/min), the recommended \nstarting dose of Talzenna is 0.5 mg once daily. Talzenna has not been studied in patients with \nCrCL < 15 mL/min or patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 5.2).  \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Talzenna in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nTalzenna is for oral use. To avoid contact with the capsule content, the capsules should be swallowed \nwhole, and must not be opened or dissolved. They can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMyelosuppression  \n \nMyelosuppression consisting of anaemia, leucopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with talazoparib (see section 4.8). Talazoparib should not be started \nuntil patients have recovered from haematological toxicity caused by previous therapy (≤ Grade 1). \n \nPrecautions should be taken to routinely monitor haematology parameters and signs and symptoms \nassociated with anaemia, leucopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia in patients receiving \ntalazoparib. If such events occur, dose modifications (reduction or interruption) are recommended (see \nsection 4.2). Supportive care with or without blood and/or platelet transfusions and/or administration \nof colony stimulating factors may be used as appropriate.  \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients \nwho received poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including \ntalazoparib. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 2 out of 584 (0.3%) solid tumour patients treated \nwith talazoparib in clinical studies. Potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML \ninclude previous platinum-containing chemotherapy, other DNA damaging agents or radiotherapy. \nComplete blood counts should be obtained at baseline and monitored monthly for signs of \nhaematologic toxicity during treatment. If MDS/AML is confirmed, talazoparib should be \ndiscontinued. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nContraception in women of childbearing potential \n \nTalazoparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood \nlymphocytes and in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats but not mutagenic in Ames \nassay (see section 5.3), and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant \nwomen should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus (see section 4.6). Women of childbearing \npotential should not become pregnant while receiving Talzenna and should not be pregnant at the \nbeginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential \nprior to treatment. \n \nA highly effective method of contraception is required for female patients during treatment with \nTalzenna, and for at least 7 months after completing therapy. Since the use of hormonal contraception \nis not recommended in patients with breast cancer, two non-hormonal and complementary \ncontraception methods should be used (see section 4.6).  \n \nMale patients with female partners of reproductive potential or pregnant partners should be advised to \nuse effective contraception (even after vasectomy), during treatment with Talzenna and for at least \n4 months after the final dose.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nTalazoparib is a substrate for drug transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and \nit is mainly eliminated by renal clearance as unchanged compound. \n \nAgents that may affect talazoparib plasma concentrations \n \nP-gp inhibitors  \nData from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumours indicated that \nco-administration of multiple daily doses of a P-gp inhibitor, itraconazole 100 mg twice daily with a \nsingle 0.5 mg talazoparib dose increased talazoparib total exposure (AUCinf) and peak concentration \n(Cmax) by approximately 56% and 40%, respectively, relative to a single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose \nadministered alone. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis has also shown that concomitant use of \nstrong P-gp inhibitors increased talazoparib exposure by 45%, relative to talazoparib given alone.  \n \nConcomitant use of strong P-gp inhibitors (including but not limited to amiodarone, carvedilol, \nclarithromycin, cobicistat, darunavir, dronedarone, erythromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, lapatinib, lopinavir, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, \ntipranavir, and verapamil) should be avoided. If co-administration with a strong P-gp inhibitor is \nunavoidable, the Talzenna dose should be reduced (see section 4.2). \n \nP-gp inducers  \nData from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumours indicated that \nco-administration of single 1 mg talazoparib dose with multiple daily doses of a P-gp inducer, rifampin \n600 mg, with rifampin co-administered 30 minutes before talazoparib on the day of talazoparib dosing, \nincreased talazoparib Cmax by approximately 37% whereas AUCinf was not affected relative to a single \n1 mg talazoparib dose administered alone. This is probably the net effect of both P-gp induction and \ninhibition by rifampin under the tested conditions in the drug-drug interaction study. No talazoparib \ndose adjustments are required when co-administered with rifampin. However, the effect of other P-gp \ninducers on talazoparib exposure has not been studied. Other P-gp inducers (including but not limited to \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort) may decrease talazoparib exposure.  \n \nBCRP inhibitors  \nThe effect of BCRP inhibitors on PK of talazoparib has not been studied in vivo. Co-administration of \ntalazoparib with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure. Concomitant use of strong \nBCRP inhibitors (including but not limited to curcumin and cyclosporine) should be avoided. If \nco-administration of strong BCRP inhibitors cannot be avoided, patient should be monitored for \npotential increased adverse reactions. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nEffect of acid-reducing agents \nPopulation PK analysis indicates that co-administration of acid-reducing agents including proton \npump inhibitors and histamine receptor 2 antagonists (H2RA), or other acid-reducing agents had no \nsignificant impact on the absorption of talazoparib. \n \nSystemic hormonal contraception \nDrug-drug interaction studies between talazoparib and oral contraceptives have not been conducted.   \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while receiving Talzenna and should \nnot be pregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of \nchildbearing potential prior to treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective forms of contraception (see section 4.4) \nprior to starting treatment with talazoparib, during treatment, and for 7 months after stopping \ntreatment with talazoparib.  Since the use of hormonal contraception is not recommended in patients \nwith breast cancer, two non-hormonal and complementary contraception methods should be used. \nMale patients with female partners of reproductive potential or pregnant partners should be advised to \nuse effective contraception (even after vasectomy) during treatment with Talzenna, and for at least \n4 months after the final dose (see section 4.4). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Talzenna in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nembryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Talzenna may cause foetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman. Talzenna is not recommended during pregnancy or for women of childbearing \npotential not using contraception (see section 4.4).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether talazoparib is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to breast-fed children \ncannot be excluded and therefore breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Talzenna \nand for at least 1 month after the final dose.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no information on fertility in patients. Based on non-clinical findings in testes (partially \nreversible) and ovary (reversible), Talzenna may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see \nsection 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTalzenna may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue/asthenia or \ndizziness may occur following administration of talazoparib. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe overall safety profile of Talzenna is based on pooled data from 494 patients who received \ntalazoparib at 1 mg daily in clinical studies for solid tumours, including 286 patients from a \nrandomised Phase 3 study with germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm), HER2-negative locally \n\n\n\n7 \n\nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer and 83 patients from a nonrandomised Phase 2 study in patients \nwith germline BRCA-mutated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. \n \nThe most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving talazoparib in these clinical studies \nwere fatigue (57.1%), anaemia (49.6%), nausea (44.3%), neutropenia (30.2%), thrombocytopenia \n(29.6%), and headache (26.5%). The most common (≥ 10%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions of \ntalazoparib were anaemia (35.2%), neutropenia (17.4%), and thrombocytopenia (16.8%). \n \nDose modifications (dose reductions or dose interruptions) due to any adverse reaction occurred in \n62.3% of patients receiving Talzenna. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose \nmodifications were anaemia (33.0%), neutropenia (15.8%), and thrombocytopenia (13.4%). \n \nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.6% of patients receiving Talzenna. \nThe median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 0.03-61.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 3 summarises adverse reactions based on pooled dataset listed by system organ class, and \nfrequency category. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10) and common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 3.

Grade 3 and Grade 4 \nmyelosuppression-related events were reported for anaemia 34.8% and 0.4%, neutropenia 15.6% and \n1.8%, and thrombocytopenia 12.8% and 4.0%. No deaths were reported due to \nmyelosuppression-related adverse reactions. Myelosuppression-related adverse events associated with \ndose modifications were reported for up to approximately 30% of patients in the talazoparib 1 mg/day \npopulation and those associated with permanent study drug discontinuation were reported for less than \n1% of patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with talazoparib. No adverse reactions were reported in one \npatient who accidentally self-administered thirty 1-mg capsules of talazoparib on Day 1 and was \nimmediately treated with gastric decontamination. Symptoms of overdose are not established. In the \nevent of overdose, treatment with talazoparib should be stopped, and physicians should consider \ngastric decontamination, follow general supportive measures and treat symptomatically.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX60 \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nTalazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, PARP1, and PARP2. PARP enzymes are involved in \ncellular DNA damage response signalling pathways such as DNA repair, gene transcription, and cell \ndeath. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by 2 mechanisms, inhibition of \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPARP catalytic activity and by PARP trapping, whereby PARP protein bound to a PARPi does not \nreadily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing DNA repair, replication, and transcription, \nthereby resulting in apoptosis and/or cell death. Treatment of cancer cell lines that are harbouring \ndefects in DNA repair genes with talazoparib single agent leads to increased levels of γH2AX, a \nmarker of double stranded DNA breaks, and results in decreased cell proliferation and increased \napoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumour activity was also observed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) \nBRCA mutant breast cancer model where the patient was previously treated with a platinum-based \nregimen. In this PDX model talazoparib decreased tumour growth and increased γH2AX level and \napoptosis in the tumours.  \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nThe effect of talazoparib on cardiac repolarisation was evaluated using time-matched \nelectrocardiograms (ECGs) in assessing the relationship between the change of the QT interval \ncorrected for heart rate (QTc) from baseline and the corresponding plasma talazoparib concentrations \nin 37 patients with advanced solid tumours. Talazoparib did not have a clinically relevant effect on \nQTc prolongation at the maximum clinically recommended dose of 1 mg once daily. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nRandomised Phase 3 study EMBRACA \nEMBRACA was an open-label, randomised, parallel, 2-arm multicentre study of Talzenna versus \nchemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) in patients with germline \nBRCA-mutated HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received no more \nthan 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic or locally advanced disease. Patients \nwere required to have received treatment with an anthracycline and/or a taxane (unless \ncontraindicated) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and/or metastatic setting. Patients with prior platinum \ntherapy for advanced disease were required to have no evidence of disease progression during \nplatinum therapy. No prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor was permitted.  \n \nOf the 431 patients randomised in the EMBRACA study, 408 (95%) were centrally confirmed to have \na deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm using a clinical trial assay; out of which 354 (82%) \nwere confirmed using the BRACAnalysis CDx®. BRCA mutation status (breast cancer susceptibility \ngene 1 [BRCA1] positive or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 [BRCA2] positive) was similar across \nboth treatment arms. \n \nA total of 431 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Talzenna 1 mg capsules once daily or \nchemotherapy at standard doses until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Of the 431 patients \nrandomised onto EMBRACA, 287 were randomised to the Talzenna arm and 144 to the chemotherapy \narm. Randomisation was stratified by prior use of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (0 versus 1, 2, \nor 3), by triple-negative disease status (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC] versus non-TNBC), and \nhistory of central nervous system metastasis (yes versus no).  \n \nPatient demographic, baseline, and disease characteristics were generally similar between the study \ntreatment arms (see Table 4).  \n \n\nTable 4.

The secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), \nsafety, and PK.  \n \nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for Talzenna compared with \nchemotherapy (see Table 5). The OS interim analysis was performed at 51% for the total number of \nplanned events.

Following repeated daily dosing of 1 mg talazoparib \nto patients, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of talazoparib at \nsteady-state was in the range of 126 (107) ng•hr/mL to 208 (37) ng•hr/mL and 11 (90) ng/mL to \n19 (27) ng/mL, respectively. Following repeated daily dosing, plasma talazoparib concentrations \nreached steady-state within 2 to 3 weeks. The median accumulation ratio of talazoparib following \nrepeated oral administration of 1 mg once daily was in the range of 2.3 to 5.2. Talazoparib is a \nsubstrate of P-gp and BCRP transporters. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration of talazoparib, the median time to Cmax (Tmax) was generally between \n1 to 2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability study has not been conducted in humans. \nHowever, based on urinary excretion data the absolute bioavailability is at least 41% with fraction \nabsorbed of at least 69% (see Elimination). No significant effect of acid-reducing agents on \ntalazoparib exposure is expected, given sufficient solubility of talazoparib at all pHs between 1 and \n6.8. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of the patients in the pivotal study were taking acid-reducing agents, \nmainly proton pump inhibitors.  \n \nThe effect of food \nFood intake decreased the rate but not the extent of talazoparib absorption. Following a single oral \ndose of talazoparib with high-fat, high-calorie food (approximately 827 calories, 57% fat), the mean \nCmax of talazoparib was decreased by approximately 46%, the median Tmax was delayed from 1 to \n4 hours, while the AUCinf was not affected. Based on these results, Talzenna can be administered with \nor without food (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nThe population mean apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of talazoparib was 420 L. In vitro, \ntalazoparib is approximately 74% bound to plasma proteins with no concentration dependence over the \nconcentration range of 0.01 µM to 1 µM. Renal impairment does not appear to impact talazoparib \nprotein binding as there was no obvious trend in the mean talazoparib fraction of unbound drug (fu) in \nhuman plasma in vivo with worsening renal function. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTalazoparib undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism in humans. Following oral administration of a \nsingle 1 mg dose of [14C]talazoparib to humans, no major circulating metabolites were identified in \nplasma, and talazoparib was the only circulating drug-derived entity identified. No metabolites that \nindividually represented more than 10% of the administered dose were recovered in the urine or faeces.  \n \nIn vitro, talazoparib was not an inhibitor of cytochrome (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant \nconcentrations. \n \nIn vitro, talazoparib did not inhibit any of the major intestinal, hepatic or renal membrane transporters \n(P-gp, BCRP, organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP]1B1, OATP1B3, organic cationic \n\n\n\n14 \n\ntransporter [OCT]1, OCT2, organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, bile salt export pump [BSEP], \nmultidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE]1 and MATE2-K) at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nIn vitro, talazoparib did not inhibit any of the major uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT) isoforms (1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15) at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nElimination \n \nRenal elimination of unchanged drug (passive filtration and active secretion) is the major route of \ntalazoparib elimination. P-gp is likely involved in talazoparib active renal secretion. The mean \n(±standard deviation) terminal plasma half-life of talazoparib was 90 (±58) hours and the population \nmean (inter-subject variability) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 6.5 (31%) L/h in cancer patients. \nIn 6 female patients given a single oral dose of [14C]talazoparib, a mean of 69% (±8.6%) and 20% \n(±5.5%) of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. \nExcretion of unchanged talazoparib in urine was the major route of elimination accounting for 55% of \nthe administered dose, while unchanged talazoparib recovered in the faeces accounted for 14%. \n \nAge, sex, and body weight \n \nA population PK analysis was conducted using data from 490 patients with cancer to evaluate the \nimpact of age (ranging from 18 to 88 years), sex (53 males and 437 females), and body weight \n(ranging from 35.7 kg to 162 kg) on the PK of talazoparib. The results have shown that age, sex, and \nbody weight had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of talazoparib. \n \nRace \n \nBased on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 41 patients were Asian and \n449 patients were Non-Asian (361 White, 16 Black, 9 Others, and 63 Not reported), talazoparib CL/F \nwas higher in Asian patients compared to Non-Asian patients, leading to 19% lower exposure (AUC) \nin Asian patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetics of talazoparib have not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nData from a PK trial in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of renal impairment indicated \nthat talazoparib total exposure (AUC0-24) after multiple talazoparib once daily doses increased by 92% \nand 169% in patients with moderate (eGFR 30 – < 60 mL/min) and severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min) renal \nimpairment, respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min). \nTalazoparib Cmax increased by 90% and 107% in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, \nrespectively, relative to patients with normal renal function. Talazoparib exposure was similar for \npatients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 – < 90 mL/min) and those with normal renal function. \nIn addition, based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 132 patients had mild \nrenal impairment (60 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 90 mL/min), 33 patients had moderate renal impairment \n(30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), and 1 patient had severe renal impairment \n(CrCL < 30 mL/min),talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 14% and 37% in patients with mild and \nmoderate renal impairment, corresponding to 17% and 59% increase in AUC, respectively, when \ncompared to patients with normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min). The PK of talazoparib have not \nbeen studied in patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 118 patients had mild hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 × ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and \nany AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the PK of talazoparib. The PK of talazoparib \n\n\n\n15 \n\nhave not been studied in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or \nsevere hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN and any AST) (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with talazoparib. \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nTalazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. Talazoparib was clastogenic \nin an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in an in vivo \nmicronucleus assay in rats at exposures similar to clinically relevant doses. This clastogenicity is \nconsistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of talazoparib, indicating \nthe potential for genotoxicity in humans. \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and in dogs, the main findings at subtherapeutic exposures \nincluded bone marrow hypocellularity with dose-dependent decrease in haematopoietic cells, depletion \nof lymphoid tissue in multiple organs and atrophy and/or degenerative changes in testes, epididymis \nand seminiferous tubules. Additional findings at higher exposures included dose-dependent increase in \napoptosis/necrosis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver and ovary. Most of the histopathologic \nfindings were generally reversible while the testes findings were partially reversible after 4 weeks of \ndosing cessation. These toxicity findings are consistent with the pharmacology of talazoparib and its \ntissue distribution pattern.  \n \nDevelopmental toxicology \n \nIn an embryo-foetal development study in rats, talazoparib resulted in embryo-foetal death, foetal \nmalformation (depressed eye bulge, small eye, split sternebrae, fused cervical vertebral arch) and \nstructural variations in bones at a maternal systemic AUC24 exposure approximately 0.09-fold the \nrelevant human exposure at the recommended dose. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Talzenna is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Talzenna  \n3. How to take Talzenna  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Talzenna  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Talzenna is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Talzenna is and how it works \nTalzenna contains the active substance talazoparib. It is a type of anticancer medicine known as a \n‘PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor’.  \n \nPatients with changes (mutations) in genes called BRCA are at risk of developing some forms of \ncancer. Talzenna works by blocking PARP, which is an enzyme that repairs damaged DNA in certain \ncancer cells. As a result, the cancer cells can no longer repair themselves and they die. \n \nWhat Talzenna is used for \nTalzenna is used to treat adults with breast cancer of a type known as HER2-negative breast cancer \nwho have an abnormal inherited BRCA gene.  \n \nTalzenna is used when the cancer has spread beyond the original tumour or to other parts of the body.   \n \nYour healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that Talzenna is right for you. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Talzenna works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Talzenna  \n \nDo not take Talzenna \n- If you are allergic to talazoparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you are breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Talzenna and during your treatment if you \nexperience signs or symptoms described in this section. \n \nLow blood cell counts \nTalzenna lowers your blood cell counts, such as your red blood cell count (anaemia), white blood cell \ncount (neutropenia), or blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Signs and symptoms you need to \nlook out for include: \n- Anaemia: Being short of breath, feeling very tired, pale skin, or fast heartbeat – these may be \n\nsigns of a low red blood cell count \n- Neutropenia: Infection, developing chills or shivering, or fever – these may be signs of a low \n\nwhite blood cell count \n- Thrombocytopenia: Bruising or bleeding for longer than usual if you hurt yourself – these may \n\nbe signs of a low blood platelet count \n \n\nYou will have regular blood tests during treatment with Talzenna to check your blood cells (white \nblood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). \n \nSerious problems with the bone marrow  \nRarely, low blood cell counts may be a sign of more serious problems with the bone marrow such as \nmyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Your doctor may want to test \nyour bone marrow to check for these problems. \n \nMale and female contraception \nWomen who can become pregnant and men with partners who are or can become pregnant should use \neffective contraception.  \nPlease see section “Male and female contraception” below. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalzenna is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). \n \nOther medicines and Talzenna \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Talzenna can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some medicines can affect the \nway Talzenna works. \n \nIn particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with Talzenna: \n- Amiodarone, carvedilol, dronedarone, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine and verapamil – \n\ngenerally used to treat heart problems. \n- Clarithromycin and erythromycin antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections. \n- Itraconazole and ketoconazole – used to treat fungal infections. \n- Cobicistat, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir and tipranavir – used \n\nto treat HIV infections/AIDS. \n- Ciclosporin – used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection. \n- Lapatinib – used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer. \n- Curcumin (e.g. found in turmeric root) in some medicines (see also section Talzenna with food \n\nand drink below). \n \n\nThe following medicines may reduce the effect of Talzenna: \n- Carbamazepine and phenytoin – anti-epileptics used to treat seizures or fits. \n- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) – a herbal remedy used to treat mild depression and \n\nanxiety. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nTalzenna with food and drink \nDo not use curcumin in food supplements while you are taking Talzenna as it may increase Talzenna’s \nside effects. Curcumin is found in turmeric root and you should not use large amounts of turmeric \nroot, but using spices in food is not likely to cause a problem. \n \nPregnancy \nTalzenna could harm an unborn baby. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be \npregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this \nmedicine. Your doctor will perform a pregnancy test prior to starting Talzenna. \n \n- You should not use Talzenna if you are pregnant. \n- You should not become pregnant while taking Talzenna. \n- Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you or your partner may \n\nbecome pregnant.  \n \nMale and female contraception \nWomen who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during \ntreatment with Talzenna and for at least 7 months after the last dose of Talzenna. Since the use of \nhormonal contraception is not recommended if you have breast cancer, you should use two \nnon-hormonal contraception methods. \nTalk to your healthcare provider about birth control methods that may be right for you. \n \nMen with female partners who are pregnant or able to become pregnant should use effective birth \ncontrol (contraception), even after a vasectomy, during treatment with Talzenna and for at least \n4 months after the last dose.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed while taking Talzenna and for at least 1 month after the last dose. It is not \nknown if Talzenna passes into breast milk. \n \nFertility \nTalazoparib may reduce fertility in men. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTalzenna may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy, weak, \nor tired (these are very common side effects of Talzenna), you should not drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Talzenna \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one 1-mg capsule taken by mouth once daily. \n \nIf you get certain side effects while you are taking Talzenna (see section 4), your doctor may lower \nyour dose or stop treatment, either temporarily or permanently.
