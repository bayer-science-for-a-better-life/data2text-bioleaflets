This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVEPACEL suspension for injection in multidose container \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (whole virion, inactivated, prepared in cell culture) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nInfluenza virus (whole virion, inactivated), containing antigen* of strain: \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1)    7.5 micrograms** \n \n* produced in Vero cells \n** haemagglutinin \n \nThis is a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection.  \nClear to opalescent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. \n \nThis indication is based on immunogenicity data from subjects from the age of 6 months onwards \nfollowing administration of two doses of vaccine prepared with H5N1 subtype strains (see section 5.1). \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and children from 6 months onwards: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nother paediatric Population  \nNo data is available on the safety and efficacy of VEPACEL in children younger than 6 months of \nage. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh, depending on the muscle mass. \n \nSee section 6.6 for administration instructions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of anaphylactic reactions to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1, or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). \nIf vaccination is considered necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in \ncase of need (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin and Vero host cell \nprotein, which are used during the manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may \noccur. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of a similar \nwhole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during a pandemic period. \nSuch reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients \nwith no known allergy. \n \nImmunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nVEPACEL must not be administered intravascularly. \n \nThere are no data with VEPACEL using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers \nneed to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection \nunless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be induced in all individuals receiving the vaccine \n(see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if co-administration \nwith another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nImmunoglobulin is not to be given with VEPACEL unless it is necessary during a medical emergency \nto provide immediate protection. If necessary, VEPACEL may be given at the same time as normal or \nspecific immunoglobulin into separate limbs. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing treatment with \nimmunosuppressants. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially, \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHTLV-1. In such cases, the western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of VEPACEL in pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed in clinical trials. \n \nAnimal studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). \n \nHealthcare providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient \nbefore prescribing VEPACEL. \n \nThe use of VEPACEL during pregnancy and lactation may be considered in a pre-pandemic situation, \ntaking into account official recommendations. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVEPACEL has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na) Summary of safety profile \n \n• Adults, older people, and special risk groups \n \nClinical trials were conducted with the H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on the \nH5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3700 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years \nand 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of \nimmunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. The adverse reactions \nobserved are shown in the table below. \n \nThe safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is \nsimilar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older people. \n \n• Infants, children, and adolescents \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: \nIn a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were \nadministered the H5N1 vaccine. The incidence and nature of symptoms after the first and second \nvaccination were similar to those observed in the healthy adults and older people. \n \nInfants and children aged 6 to 35 months: \nIn a clinical trial the H5N1 vaccine was administered to 36 infants and children aged 6 to 35 months. \n \nThe observed adverse reactions from a paediatric clinical trial with the H5N1 vaccine are listed below.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nb) Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery Common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 -

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nClear to opalescent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. \n \nThis indication is based on immunogenicity data from subjects from the age of 6 months onwards \nfollowing administration of two doses of vaccine prepared with H5N1 subtype strains (see section 5.1). \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and children from 6 months onwards: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nother paediatric Population  \nNo data is available on the safety and efficacy of VEPACEL in children younger than 6 months of \nage. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh, depending on the muscle mass. \n \nSee section 6.6. for administration instructions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of anaphylactic reactions to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1, or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). \nIf vaccination is considered necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in \ncase of need (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin and Vero host cell protein, \nwhich are used during the manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of a similar \nwhole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during a pandemic period. \nSuch reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients \nwith no known allergy. \n \nImmunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nVEPACEL must not be administered intravascularly. \n \nThere are no data with VEPACEL using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers \nneed to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection \nunless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be induced in all individuals receiving the vaccine \n(see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if co-administration \nwith another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nImmunoglobulin is not to be given with VEPACEL unless it is necessary during a medical emergency \nto provide immediate protection. If necessary, VEPACEL may be given at the same time as normal or \nspecific immunoglobulin into separate limbs. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing treatment with \nimmunosuppressants. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of VEPACEL in pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed in clinical trials. \n \nAnimal studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). \n \nHealthcare providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient \nbefore prescribing VEPACEL. \n \nThe use of VEPACEL during pregnancy and lactation may be considered in a pre-pandemic situation, \ntaking into account official recommendations. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVEPACEL has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na) Summary of safety profile \n \n• Adults, older people, and special risk groups \n \nClinical trials were conducted with the H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on the \nH5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3700 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years and \n60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of \nimmunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. The adverse reactions \nobserved are shown in the table below. \n \nThe safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is \nsimilar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older people. \n \n• Infants, children, and adolescents  \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: \nIn a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were \nadministered the H5N1 vaccine. The incidence and nature of symptoms after the first and second \nvaccination were similar to those observed in the healthy adults and older people.  \n \nInfants and children aged 6 to 35 months: \nIn a clinical trial the H5N1 vaccine was administered to 36 infants and children aged 6 to 35 months. \n \nThe observed adverse reactions from a paediatric clinical trial with the H5N1 vaccine are listed below.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nb) Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery Common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 -

In addition, the immunogenicity has also been \nevaluated in a Phase 3 study in specified risk groups of immunocompromised subjects (N=122) and \npatients with chronic disease conditions (N=123) following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nImmunogenicity in adults aged 18 to 59 years (N=961) and in subjects aged 60 years and \nolder (N=391) \n \nAfter primary vaccination the rate of subjects with neutralising antibody titres > 20, seroconversion \nrate and seroconversion factor as measured by microneutralisation assay (MN) in adults \naged 18 to 59 years and in older people aged 60 years and above were as follows: \n \n\n 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n 21 Days after 21 Days after \n 1st Dose 2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 44.4% 69.7% 51.9% 69.2% \nSeroconversion rate** 32.7% 56.0% 13.3% 23.9% \nSeroconversion factor*** 3.0 4.5 2.0 2.6 \n\n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n** ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titre \n*** geometric mean increase \n \nImmunogenicity in immunocompromised subjects (N=122) and patients with chronic disease \nconditions (N=123) \n \nAfter vaccination the rate of subjects with neutralising antibody titres ≥ 20, seroconversion rate and \nseroconversion factor as measured by MN assay in immunocompromised subjects and patients with \nchronic disease conditions were as follows: \n \n\n Immunocompromised subjects Patients with chronic disease conditions \n 21 Days after 21 Days after \n 1st Dose 2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 24.8% 41.5% 44.3% 64.2% \nSeroconversion rate** 9.1% 32.2% 17.2% 35.0% \nSeroconversion factor*** 1.6 2.5 2.3 3.0 \n\n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n** ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titre \n*** geometric mean increase \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nCross-reactive immune response against related H5N1 strains \n \nIn a clinical study in adults aged 18 to 59 years (N=265) and in older people aged 60 years and above \n(N=270) after vaccination with the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine, the rate of subjects with \ncross-neutralising antibodies as measured by MN (titre ≥ 20) was as follows: \n \n\n 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n Strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 \n 21 Days after 2nd Dose 21 Days after 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 35.1% 54.8% \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n \nHeterologous booster vaccinations \n \nA heterologous booster vaccination with a 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of the \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 strain vaccine has been administered in a time frame of 12 to 24 months after \npriming vaccination with two doses of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine in three clinical \nstudies in adults aged 18 to 59 years and in older people aged 60 years and above.

All ferrets were challenged intranasally \non day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent H5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and \nmonitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine \ndemonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. The A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection \nagainst homologous challenge as evidenced by full survival, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced \nand shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of \ninflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control \nanimals. All control animals succumbed to the infection. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical studies demonstrated minor alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels in a repeat \ndose toxicity study in rats. Clinically significant alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels have \nnot been seen to date in human clinical studies. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicology studies do not indicate harmful effects in regard to \nfemale fertility, embryo-foetal and pre- and post-natal toxicity. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \nVEPACEL suspension for injection \n\nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (whole virion, inactivated, prepared in cell culture) \n \n\n This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What VEPACEL is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive VEPACEL \n3. How VEPACEL is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store VEPACEL \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What VEPACEL is and what it is used for \n \nVEPACEL is a vaccine for use in individuals aged 6 months and older. It is intended to be given \nbefore the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around \nthe world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of an ordinary flu but are usually more \nsevere. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, VEPACEL may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive VEPACEL \n \nYou should not receive VEPACEL \n \n- if you have previously had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of VEPACEL (these are \n\nlisted at the end of the leaflet – section 6) or to any substances that may be present in trace (very \nlow) amounts: formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein. \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to have the \nvaccine, provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an \nallergic reaction. \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou should tell your doctor before vaccination: \n- if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with VEPACEL. \n\n- if you have had any allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine (see section 6 at the end of \nthe leaflet) or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). \nAllergic reactions, including sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have been \nreported following use of a similar vaccine for H1N1 influenza during a pandemic period. Such \nreactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with \nno known allergy. \n\n- if you have a weakened immune system as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, \ne.g. taking of corticosteroids or treatment for cancer. \n\n- if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nIf you need a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses in the first few weeks \nafter vaccination with VEPACEL, the result of the test may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting \nthe test that you have recently received VEPACEL. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and VEPACEL \n \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or if you have recently received any \nother vaccine. \n \nThere is no information on administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if this cannot \nbe avoided, the other vaccine should not be injected into the same arm used for VEPACEL. \nYou should be aware that side effects may be intensified. \n \nIf you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment that \naffects the immune system (such as radiotherapy), VEPACEL can still be given but your response to \nthe vaccine may be poor. \n \nVEPACEL should not be given at the same time as immunoglobulins. However, if this cannot be \navoided, the immunoglobulins should not be injected into the same arm used for VEPACEL. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice if you should receive VEPACEL. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nVEPACEL may affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n3. How VEPACEL is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \nThe vaccine will be injected into the muscle of the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, \ndepending on the muscle mass. The vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \nInfants, children and adolescents from the age of 6 months to 17 years and adults from the age \nof 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml will be given. A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least \nthree weeks. \n \n \n4.

What you need to know before you receive VEPACEL \n3. How VEPACEL is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store VEPACEL \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What VEPACEL is and what it is used for \n \nVEPACEL is a vaccine for use in individuals aged 6 months and older. It is intended to be given \nbefore the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around \nthe world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of an ordinary flu but are usually more \nsevere. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, VEPACEL may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive VEPACEL \n \nYou should not receive VEPACEL \n \n- if you have previously had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of VEPACEL (these are \n\nlisted at the end of the leaflet – section 6) or to any substances that may be present in trace (very \nlow) amounts: formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein. \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to have the \nvaccine, provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an \nallergic reaction. \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou should tell your doctor before vaccination: \n- if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with VEPACEL. \n\n- if you have had any allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine (see section 6 at the end of \nthe leaflet) or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). \nAllergic reactions, including sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have been \nreported following use of a similar vaccine for H1N1 influenza during a pandemic period. Such \nreactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with \nno known allergy. \n\n- if you have a weakened immune system as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, \ne.g. taking of corticosteroids or treatment for cancer. \n\n- if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nIf you need a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses in the first few weeks \nafter vaccination with VEPACEL, the result of the test may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting \nthe test that you have recently received VEPACEL. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel. \nThere is no information on the use of VEPACEL under the skin. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and VEPACEL \n \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or if you have recently received any \nother vaccine. \n \nThere is no information on administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if this cannot \nbe avoided, the other vaccine should not be injected into the same arm used for VEPACEL. \nYou should be aware that side effects may be intensified. \n \nIf you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment that \naffects the immune system (such as radiotherapy), VEPACEL can still be given but your response to \nthe vaccine may be poor. \n \nVEPACEL should not be given at the same time as immunoglobulins. However, if this cannot be \navoided, the immunoglobulins should not be injected into the same arm used for VEPACEL. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice  if you should receive VEPACEL. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nVEPACEL may affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n3. How VEPACEL is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \nThe vaccine will be injected into the muscle of the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, \ndepending on the muscle mass. The vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \nInfants, children and adolescents from the age of 6 months to 17 years and adults from the age \nof 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml will be given. A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least \nthree weeks. \n \n \n4.
