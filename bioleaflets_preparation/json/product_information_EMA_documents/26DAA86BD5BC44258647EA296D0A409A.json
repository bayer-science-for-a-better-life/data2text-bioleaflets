This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOXERVATE 20 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 20 micrograms of cenegermin*. \n \n* Recombinant form of human nerve growth factor produced in Escherichia Coli. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution (eye drops). \nClear, colourless solution. pH 7.0-7.4 and osmolarity 280-320 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications  \n \nTreatment of moderate (persistent epithelial defect) or severe (corneal ulcer) neurotrophic keratitis in \nadults. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration  \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional \nqualified in ophthalmology. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults:  \nThe recommended dose is one drop of OXERVATE in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s), 6 \ntimes a day at 2 hourly intervals, starting from the morning and within 12 hours. Treatment should be \ncontinued for eight weeks. \n \nPatients with an eye infection should be treated before starting therapy with OXERVATE (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued as normal, at the next scheduled administration. The \nmissed dose can be administered later, within the 12 hours shelf-life of the daily vial. Patients should \nbe advised not to instil more than one drop in the affected eye(s) during any administration. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly:  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age and older. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nHepatic and renal impairment:  \nThe medicinal product has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, no \ndose adjustment is considered necessary in these populations.  \n \nPaediatric population:  \nThe safety and efficacy of this medicinal product in children and adolescents below the age of \n18 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor ocular use only. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product: \n \nPatients should be instructed to wash their hands before use. \n \nOXERVATE should only be administered using the associated delivery system (vial adapter and \npipettes), according to the instructions presented in section 6.6. \nAn individual pipette should be used per application.  \n \nIf more than one topical ophthalmic product is being used, the eye drops must be administered at least \n15 minutes apart, to avoid diluting the other product. If eye ointment, gel or other viscous eye drops \nare used, they should be administered 15 minutes following OXERVATE treatment (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nIn case of concomitant use with contact lenses, see section 4.4. \nFor instructions on preparation and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRisk of corneal melting or impending perforation \n \nIt is important that the risk of corneal melting or impending perforation, and the need to undergo \nemergency surgery or another procedure is assessed before starting therapy with OXERVATE as \ncenegermin should not be used in patients requiring immediate surgery. \n \nEye reactions \n \nOXERVATE may cause mild to moderate eye discomfort, such as eye pain, to the patient. The patient \nshould be advised to contact the doctor in case of concern or a more severe eye reaction. \n \nUse of corticosteroids or eye drops containing preservatives \n \nUse of ophthalmic topical agents known to inhibit epithelial healing, including corticosteroids or eye \ndrops containing preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, polyquaternium-1, benzododecinium \nbromide, cetrimide and other quaternary ammonium derivatives, should be avoided during treatment \nof neurotrophic keratitis, as they could interfere with corneal healing (see section 4.5). \n \nEye infections \n \nAn eye infection should be treated before use of OXERVATE. Should an eye infection occur, \nOXERVATE should be suspended until infection resolution (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \nOcular cancer \n \nCenegermin may theoretically affect ocular cancer, as it is a growth factor. OXERVATE should be \nused with caution in patients with ocular cancer. It is recommended that these patients continue to be \nmonitored for cancer progression during and after treatment with this medicinal product.  \n \nContact lenses \n \nPatients should be instructed to remove contact lenses before applying OXERVATE and to wait \n15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion, because the presence of a contact lens \n(either therapeutic or corrective) could theoretically limit the distribution of cenegermin onto the area \nof the corneal lesion. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther topical ophthalmic products may be used during treatment with OXERVATE when used \n15 minutes apart, with the exception of agents known to inhibit epithelial healing (e.g. corticosteroids \nor eye drops containing preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, polyquaternium-1, \nbenzododecinium bromide, cetrimide and other quaternary ammonium derivatives) (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4). If eye ointment, gel or other viscous eye drops are used, OXERVATE should be \nadministered first. \n \nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. \nAs systemic absorption of cenegermin after use of the medicinal product is negligible or not \ndetectable, no drug interactions are anticipated. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of cenegermin in pregnant women. Animal studies with cenegermin do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity when administered \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.3). \n \nSystemic exposure to cenegermin is negligible or does not occur. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of OXERVATE during pregnancy.  \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is not known whether cenegermin is excreted in human milk.  \n \nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from this \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of cenegermin on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe treatment has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, as it may cause temporary \nblurred vision or other visual disturbances, which is expected to last a few minutes after instillation. If \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nblurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or using \nmachines. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients suffering from neurotrophic keratitis and \ntreated with OXERVATE during clinical studies include eye pain (11.1 %),  eye inflammation \n(8.3 %), which may include anterior chamber inflammation and hyphaema; lacrimation increased \n(5.6 %), with symptoms such as eye discharge; eyelid pain (5.6 %) and foreign body sensation in the \neye (5.6 %). \n \nEye pain was the most frequently reported adverse reaction, followed by eye irritation and abnormal \nsensation in the eye, when considering the whole population treated with the medicinal product (i.e. \npopulation included in clinical trials also on indications other than neurotrophic keratitis). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions listed below were observed in clinical studies in patients suffering \nfrom neurotrophic keratitis, treated with OXERVATE 20 μg/ml.  \n \nAdverse drug reactions are presented below according to MedDRA system organ classification (SOC \nand Preferred Term Level). \nThey are ranked according to system organ class and classified according to the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nUncommon Corneal abscess \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache \n\nEye disorders \n\nVery common Eye pain \n\nCommon \nEye inflammation, eyelid pain, foreign body sensation \nin the eye, lacrimation increased, blepharitis, \nconjunctival hyperaemia, photophobia, eye irritation \n\nUncommon Corneal neovascularization \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose  \n \nA topical overdose is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity. A topical overdose of \ncenegermin may be flushed from the eye(s) with lukewarm water. \n \n  \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic Group: {not yet assigned}, ATC code: {not yet assigned}. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n \n\nMechanism of action \n \nOXERVATE contains cenegermin, a recombinant form of human nerve growth factor. \n \nNerve growth factor is an endogenous protein involved in the differentiation and maintenance of \nneurons, which acts through specific high-affinity (i.e., TrkA) and low-affinity (i.e. p75NTR) nerve \ngrowth factor receptors. Nerve growth factor receptors are expressed in the anterior segment of the eye \n(cornea, conjunctiva, iris, ciliary body, and lens), by the lacrimal gland, and by posterior segment \nintraocular tissues. The treatment with cenegermin, administered as eye drops, is intended to allow \nrestoration of corneal integrity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of OXERVATE were evaluated in two multicentre, randomised, double-\nmasked, vehicle-controlled clinical studies (NGF0212 and NGF0214) in patients with moderate \n(persisted epithelial defect) or severe (corneal ulcer) neurotropic keratitis refractory to non-surgical \ntreatments. In both studies patients received OXERVATE or vehicle 6 times daily in the affected \neye(s) for 8 weeks, and underwent a follow-up period. \n \nStudy NGF0214 enrolled 48 patients (mean age 65±14 years, range 33-94 years) treated with \nOXERVATE 20 µg/ml or vehicle (24 patients per arm). Study NGF0212 enrolled a total of 174 \npatients (mean age 61±16 years, range 18-95 years), who have been exposed to OXERVATE and \nvehicle without the L-methionine excipient; 156 patients were assessed independently for efficacy, \ncomparing two different dosages of the medicinal product with 20 and 10 µg/ml cenegermin to vehicle \n(52 patients per arm). \nThe table below summarizes the results for complete corneal healing of the persistent epithelial defect \nor corneal ulcer (the primary endpoint, defined as the greatest diameter of corneal fluorescein staining \n<0.5 mm) after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment for patients who received OXERVATE 20 µg/ml or \nvehicle in the two studies. \n \n Study NGF0214 Study NGF0212 \nResults after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment Week 4 Week 8 Week 4 Week 8 \n\nComplete corneal healing rate \nOXERVATE 56.5 % 69.6 % 58.0 % 74.0 % \n\nvehicle 37.5 % 29.2 % 19.6 % 43.1 % \n(p value) (0.191) (0.006) (0.001) (0.002) \n\n \nThe percentage of patients experiencing complete corneal clearing (grade 0 on the modified Oxford \nscale), the least squares mean change in best corrected distance visual acuity score (Early Treatment \nDiabetic Retinopathy Study letters) from baseline and any improvement in corneal sensitivity as \nmeasured in millimetres by Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometry (difference compared to baseline >0) was \nalso measured after 8 weeks of treatment in both studies, and summarized in the table below. \n \nResults after 8 weeks of treatment Study NGF0214 Study NGF0212 \n\nComplete corneal clearing \nOXERVATE 22.7 % 21.4 % \n\nVehicle 4.2 % 10.0 % \n(p value) (0.062) (0.157) \n\nBest corrected distance visual acuity \nOXERVATE 6.11 11.9 \n\nVehicle 3.53  6.9 \n(p value) (0.143) (0.213) \n\nCorneal sensitivity inside lesion \nOXERVATE 72.2 % 76.3 % \n\nVehicle 60.0 % 68.4 % \n(p value) (0.458) (0.442) \n\n \nPatients considered completely healed at the end of 8 weeks of treatment with OXERVATE did not \ntend to have recurrences within the 12 months follow-up period of study NGF0212. Specifically, more \nthan 80 % of the 31 patients who were healed after initial OXERVATE 20 µg/ml treatment and for \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nwhom a response was available, remained completely healed at the end of the 12 months follow up \nperiod. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nmedicinal product in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in neurotrophic keratitis (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nCenegermin is mostly removed from the eye with the tear production and through the naso-lacrimal \nduct; the minor portion that is absorbed occurs mostly in the conjunctiva and peri-orbital tissue and to \na minor extent through the cornea following ocular administration.  \nPharmacokinetic profiling of patients included in studies found no accumulation effect of cenegermin. \nIn general, the systemic absorption of OXERVATE is negligible. \n \nDistribution \n \nAfter eye drop administration, cenegermin is distributed particularly in the anterior portion of the eye, \nalthough a study with radiolabelled cenegermin in rats has shown that it also reaches the retina and \nother posterior parts of the eye at doses significantly higher than those administered by eye drops in \nhumans to treat neurotrophic keratitis. At the ocular doses, cenegermin is not distributed throughout \nbody tissues as there is no systemic absorption above the natural baseline levels. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nOcular administered cenegermin is mainly eliminated by tear secretion and the remainder mostly \nbiotransformed by local tissue proteases. \n \nElimination \n \nCenegermin administered by eye drops is mostly eliminated with the tear secretion. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology \n(central nervous system), single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction, \nembryo-foetal development, pre- and post-natal development using ocular (eye drop), intravenous, \nand/or subcutaneous administration.  \n \n \n6.

As \nsoon as the patient is at home (and no later than 5 hours from when the patient receives the product at \nthe pharmacy), the weekly carton should be placed into the refrigerator, at 2-8 °C. It should be noted \nthat the frozen medicinal product received from the pharmacy could need up to 30 minutes for \nthawing. \n \nAn individual multi-dose vial of OXERVATE is to be removed from the fridge for use over the course \nof a single day. Each opened vial can be stored in the fridge or below 25 °C, but must be used within \n12 hours. \nAfter this period of time the vial contents should be discarded irrespective of whether some residual \nproduct remains in the vial. \n \n6.5  Nature and contents of container \n \n1 ml OXERVATE solution in sterile, preservative-free multi-dose Type I glass vials, closed with a \nrubber stopper and an aluminium overseal with a polypropylene flip-off cap, presented in cardboard \ncartons. \n \nPack size: 7 multi-dose vials per carton \n \nThe patient will receive a weekly carton containing 7 vials of OXERVATE. \n \nThis medicinal product should only be used with specific vial adapters and disposable devices \n(pipettes) that will be provided separately from the weekly OXERVATE carton.  \n7 vial adapters (i.e. 1 per day), 42 pipettes (i.e. 6 per day) and 42 disinfectant wipes (i.e. 6 per day) \nsufficient to administer the medicinal product for one week will be provided separately, together with \na dose recording card. Extra adapter (1), pipettes (3) and wipes (3) will also be provided as spares. \n \n6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe patient will receive a weekly carton containing 7 multi-dose vials of OXERVATE, which should \nbe stored in a refrigerator until the day of use. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nThe patient will also receive separately vial adapters, pipettes and disinfectant wipes. \n \nAn individual multi-dose vial of OXERVATE should be taken from the refrigerator at the same time \neach morning bearing in mind the 12 hour treatment schedule. The multi-dose vial containing the \nproduct should be prepared according to the following instructions: \n \n1) With clean freshly-washed hands, place the vial on a steady flat surface and remove the plastic \n\nflip-off cap. \n2) Peel-off the back of the vial adapter blister pack. \n3) Without removing the vial adapter from its blister pack, connect the vial adapter to the vial by \n\nfirmly pushing the vial adapter down vertically until it snaps into place over the neck of the vial \nand the spike of the vial adapter pierces through the vial’s rubber stopper. Once the vial adapter \nhas been connected correctly, it should not be removed from the vial. \n\n4) Remove and discard the vial adapter blister pack. Avoid touching the surface of the adapter. \n \n\n1 \n\n \n \n\n 2 \n \n\n \n\n 3-4 \n\n \n\n \nTo withdraw and administer each dose of OXERVATE solution, the steps below should be followed: \n \n5) Take an individual disinfectant wipe and gently clean the surface of the valve on the luer lock \n\nconnector of the vial adapter. After cleaning, the valve should be allowed to dry for \napproximately one minute. \n\n6) Take a pipette and remove it from the protective packaging. \n7) Screw the pipette clockwise into the luer lock connector of the vial adapter. \n8) Ensure that the pipette plunger is pushed all the way down. \n9) Turn the vial upside-down with the pipette connected and gently pull the pipette plunger \n\noutwards until it stops, to draw the solution into the pipette (ensure that the plunger has reached \nthe stop point). \n\n10) Check the pipette and confirm that it contains some of the solution. Air bubbles may cause \nblockage and prevent the pipette from filling properly (especially at first withdrawal). If the \npipette is empty, keep the vial with the connected pipette upside-down, push the plunger all the \nway in and pull it out again. \n\n11) Once it has been correctly filled, unscrew the pipette from the luer lock connector of the vial \nadapter. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n5 \n\n \n \n\n 6-7-8 \n \n\n \n\n 9-10-11 \n\n \n \n\n \n12) Hold the pipette, pointing down, between the middle finger and thumb, tilt the head back and \n\nposition the pipette above the affected eye. Pull down the lower eyelid. Gently push the pipette \nplunger in until a single drop is instilled into the conjunctival fornix. \n\n13) Immediately discard the used pipette and wipe after instillation. \n14) If a mistake is made and a drop is not instilled into the eye, repeat the steps described above \n\nusing a new pipette and wipe. \n15) Throughout the day, the vial can either be placed back in the fridge after each use or stored \n\nbelow 25 °C (with the vial adapter still connected). \n \n\n12-13-14 \n\n   \n \nThe administration instructions above (steps 5 to 15) should be repeated every 2 hours (six times per \nday) using a new disinfectant wipe and a new pipette each time. \n \nThe vial and any remaining solution must be discarded at the end of the day, and no later than \n12 hours from the time the vial adapter was connected (irrespective of whether any residual solution \nremains in the vial). \n \nTo ensure accurate dosing every 2 hours, the patient should be advised to set an alarm as a reminder \nfor dosing.  \n \nTo control that six doses have been taken every day, the patient should be advised to use the weekly \ndose recording card provided with the delivery system. On that card the patient should track the date \nof the first use of the weekly supply, the time of the vial opening (i.e. when the vial adapter is \nconnected to the vial), and the time of daily ocular instillations occurring over the week.  \n \nA new OXERVATE supply will be issued each week for the duration of the treatment period. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nOXERVATE 20 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution \ncenegermin \n\n \n▼This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What OXERVATE is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use OXERVATE \n3. How to use OXERVATE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store OXERVATE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What OXERVATE is and what it is used for \n \nOXERVATE contains the active ingredient cenegermin. Cenegermin is a type of nerve growth factor \n(a human protein) which is naturally present on the eye surface. \n \nOXERVATE is used to treat adults with moderate or severe ‘neurotrophic keratitis’. This is a disease \naffecting the cornea (the transparent layer in the front part of the eye) which causes defects on the \nouter surface of the cornea that do not heal naturally or corneal ulcers. \nOXERVATE is intended to allow the healing of the cornea. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use OXERVATE \n \nDo not use OXERVATE: \n- if you are allergic to cenegermin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nOnly use this medicine in your affected eye(s). \nTalk to your doctor before using this medicine: \n- if you have an infection in your eye, as the infection should be treated first. If you get an eye \n\ninfection whilst using OXERVATE, you should stop your treatment and consult your doctor for \nadvice straightaway. \n\n- if you have an eye cancer, because this medicine might worsen your cancer.  \n- if you are taking any eye drops containing corticosteroids (e.g. to treat an ocular inflammation) \n\nor preservatives (e.g. benzalkonium chloride, polyquaternium-1, benzododecinium bromide, \ncetrimide). Eye drops containing these substances could slow down or interfere with the healing \nof your eye and should therefore be avoided during treatment with this medicine.  \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nTreatment with OXERVATE may cause you mild to moderate eye discomfort such as eye pain. If you \nexperience a severe eye reaction seek medical advice from your doctor.  \n \nContact lenses could interfere with the correct use of this medicine. If you wear contact lenses remove \nthem before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes after using this medicine before reinserting \nthem. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, as there is not \nenough information about its use in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and OXERVATE \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nYou should wait at least 15 minutes before or after using OXERVATE if you use any other eye \ndrops. This will help to avoid one eye drop diluting the other eye drop. If you also use an eye ointment \nor gel or an eye drop with a thick consistency, you should use OXERVATE first, and then wait at \nleast 15 minutes before using the other medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nThe use of this medicine should be avoided during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant \nor think you may be pregnant. \n \nIt is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. Talk to your doctor before breast-feeding your \nbaby, as a decision must be made whether to stop breast-feeding or to avoid or stop OXERVATE \ntherapy. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour vision may be temporarily blurred immediately after using this medicine. If this happens, wait \nuntil your vision clears before you drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use OXERVATE \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is 1 drop in the affected eye 6 times a day at 2-hourly intervals, starting in \nthe morning (i.e. 6 drops per day within 12 hours). You should continue your treatment for 8 weeks. \n \nInstructions for use \nFollow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not \nunderstand. \nOcular use.  \nYou will receive an insulated container containing a weekly carton of OXERVATE and a separate \ndelivery system (composed of medical devices intended for withdrawing and administering the \nmedicine). \n \nThe weekly carton contains 7 vials of OXERVATE (1 vial per day of the week). Remove the weekly \ncarton of OXERVATE from the insulated container and store it in a fridge as soon as you can (and in \nany case no later than 5 hours from when you receive the medicine from your pharmacist). Since at the \npharmacy this medicine is stored in a freezer, in case treatment is started right away after receiving the \nweekly carton, you will have to wait until the first vial is thawed (this could take up to 30 minutes). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nTake an individual vial of this medicine from the fridge in the morning (always at the same time each \nmorning), and prepare it in the following way: \n• Wash your hands. \n• If you wear contact lenses, take them out before using the drops. \n• Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the vial (picture 1). \n• Peel-off the back of the vial adapter blister pack (picture 2). \n• Without removing the vial adapter from its blister pack, connect it to the vial by firmly pushing \n\nit down until it snaps into place over the neck of the vial. The spike of the vial adapter should \npierce through the vial’s rubber stopper. Once the vial adapter has been connected correctly, it \nshould not be removed from the vial (picture 3). \n\n• Remove and discard the packaging of the vial adapter. \n \n\n1 \n\n \n \n\n 2 \n \n\n \n\n 3 \n\n \n\n \nThe multi-dose vial of OXERVATE is now ready for use (1 drop in the affected eye every 2 hours six \ntimes a day). The vial can be stored in the fridge or below 25 °C throughout the day, but should not be \nfrozen. \n \nTo withdraw and administer each dose of this medicine, follow the steps below: \n• Take a single disinfectant wipe and gently clean the surface of the valve on the connector part of \n\nthe vial adapter (picture 4). After cleaning, wait for approximately 1 minute to allow the valve \nto dry. \n\n• Take a pipette (dropper) and remove it from its protective packaging. \n• Screw the pipette (clockwise) into the connector part of the vial adapter (picture 5). \n• Ensure that the pipette plunger is pushed all the way down. \n• Turn the vial upside-down (with the pipette still connected) and gently pull the plunger until it \n\nstops, to draw the solution into the pipette. Ensure the plunger has reached the stop point \n(picture 6). \n  \n\n4 \n\n \n \n\n 5 \n \n\n \n\n 6 \n\n \n \n\n \n• Check the pipette to ensure it contains the eye drops, solution. Air bubbles may cause blockage \n\nand prevent the pipette from filling properly (especially at first withdrawal). If the pipette is \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nempty, keep the vial with the connected pipette upside-down, push the plunger all the way in \nand pull it out again. \n\n• Once it has been correctly filled, unscrew the pipette from the connector part of the vial adapter. \n• Holding the pipette, pointing down, between your middle finger and thumb, tilt your head back \n\nand position the pipette above your affected eye. Pull down your lower eyelid, folding between \nthe inner eyelid and the eyeball. Gently push the plunger in until a single drop is dropped into \nthe conjunctival fornix (picture 7). Make sure you do not touch your eye with the tip of the \npipette. \n\n• With your head still tilted back, blink a few times so that the medicine covers the surface of \nyour eye. \n\n• Immediately discard the used pipette after use, even if there is still some liquid left in it. \n• If a drop misses your eye, try again, using a new pipette and wipe. \n• After each use throughout the day, place the vial back in the fridge (or keep it below 25 °C) for \n\nthe rest of the day, with the vial adapter still connected. \n \n\n7\n\n    \n \nRepeat the above process (from picture 4 onwards) every 2 hours 6 times a day. Use a new \ndisinfectant wipe and a new pipette each time. \n \nIf you use drops in both eyes, repeat the above instructions for your other eye using a new pipette (in \nthis case, you will need to use 2 vials per day). \n \nDiscard the used vial at the end of each day (even if there is still some liquid left in it), and in any case \nno later than 12 hours from the time you connected the vial adapter to it. \n \nYou will receive a new supply of OXERVATE each week, for the duration of the treatment period. \nTo ensure accurate dosing every 2 hours, you could set an alarm as a reminder for dosing. \n \nTo control that six doses have been taken at the end of each treatment day, you should use the weekly \ndose recording card provided with the delivery system. On that card you should write down the date of \nthe first use of the weekly supply, the time of the vial opening (i.e. when you connect the vial adapter \nto the vial) and track each time you use an eye drop of this medicine, over the week. \n \nIf you use more OXERVATE than you should \nIf you use more than you should, flush the affected eye with lukewarm water. Do not put in any more \ndrops until it is time for your next regular dose. Using more OXERVATE than is recommended is not \nlikely to be harmful.  Continue with your next dose as scheduled. \n \nIf you forget to use OXERVATE \nContinue with your next dose as scheduled. Do not use a double dose to make up for the forgotten \ndose. You can give the missed dose 2 hours after your last scheduled dose of the day, provided this is \nstill within 12 hours from first opening the daily vial. Do not use more than 6 drops each day in the \naffected eye(s). \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \nIf you stop using OXERVATE  \nThe lesion or ulcer in your eye will worsen and could lead to infections or impaired vision. Speak to \nyour doctor first if you intend to stop using OXERVATE. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe majority of side effects occur generally in and around the eyes. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• eye pain. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• inflammation of the eye; \n• pain in the eyelid; \n• abnormal sensation and discomfort in the eye, including feeling that there is something in the \n\neye; \n• increase of tears (this could include symptoms such as discharge in the eye); \n• inflammation of the eyelid with itching and redness; \n• redness of the conjunctiva (mucous membrane that covers the front of the eye and lines the \n\ninside of the eyelids); \n• sensitivity to light; \n• irritation in or around the eye;  \n• headache. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• excessive ingrowth of blood vessels into the cornea; \n• infection of the cornea with pus and swelling. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store OXERVATE \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton and vial label after \n“EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore the weekly carton containing 7 vials of OXERVATE in the fridge (2-8 °C). \n \nAfter the vial adapter is connected to the vial, it can be stored in the fridge or below 25 °C. Discard the \nused vial at the end of the day (even if there is still some liquid left in it), and in any case no later than \n12 hours from the time you connected the vial adapter to it. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n \n\nThe pipettes included in the delivery system are single-use only. Each pipette should be discarded \nimmediately after using, even if there is still some liquid left in it. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
