CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris \nIvabradine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in coronary artery \ndisease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate \u2265 70 bpm. Ivabradine is indicated: \n\n\u2012 in adults unable to tolerate or with a contra-indication to the use of beta-blockers \nor \n\u2012 in combination with beta-blockers in patients inadequately controlled with an optimal beta-blocker \n\ndose. \n \nTreatment of chronic heart failure \nIvabradine is indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class with systolic dysfunction, in patients \nin sinus rhythm and whose heart rate is \u2265 75 bpm, in combination with standard therapy including beta-\nblocker therapy or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nFor the different doses, film-coated tablets containing 5 mg and 7.5 mg ivabradine are available. \n \nSymptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris \nIt is recommended that the decision to initiate or titrate treatment takes place with the availability of serial \nheart rate measurements, ECG or ambulatory 24-hour monitoring. \nThe starting dose of ivabradine should not exceed 5 mg twice daily in patients aged below 75 years. \nAfter three to four weeks of treatment, if the patient is still symptomatic, if the initial dose is well tolerated \nand if resting heart rate remains above 60 bpm, the dose may be increased to the next higher dose \nin patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. \nThe maintenance dose should not exceed 7.5 mg twice daily. \nIf there is no improvement in symptoms of angina within 3 months after start of treatment, treatment \nof ivabradine should be discontinued. \nIn addition, discontinuation of treatment should be considered if there is only limited symptomatic \nresponse and when there is no clinically relevant reduction in resting heart rate within three months. \nIf, during treatment, heart rate decreases below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the patient \nexperiences symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must \nbe titrated downward including the lowest dose of 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily). \nAfter dose reduction, heart rate should be monitored (see section 4.4). Treatment must be discontinued \nif heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist despite dose reduction. \n \nTreatment of chronic heart failure \nThe treatment has to be initiated only in patient with stable heart failure. \nIt is recommended that the treating physician should be experienced in the management of chronic heart \nfailure. \nThe usual recommended starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily. After two weeks of treatment, \nthe dose can be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily if resting heart rate is persistently above 60 bpm \nor decreased to 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily) if resting heart rate is persistently \nbelow 50 bpm or in case of symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension. \nIf heart rate is between 50 and 60 bpm, the dose of 5 mg twice daily should be maintained. \nIf during treatment, heart rate decreases persistently below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest \nor the patient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia, the dose must be titrated downward \nto the next lower dose in patients receiving 7.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. If heart rate increases \npersistently above 60 beats per minute at rest, the dose can be up titrated to the next upper dose \nin patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. \nTreatment must be discontinued if heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist \n(see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nIn patients aged 75 years or more, a lower starting dose should be considered (2.5 mg twice daily i.e. one \nhalf 5 mg tablet twice daily) before up-titration if necessary. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance \nabove 15 mL/min (see section 5.2). No data are available in patients with creatinine clearance \nbelow 15 mL/min. Ivabradine should therefore be used with precaution in this population. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \nwhen using ivabradine in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Ivabradine is contra-indicated \nfor use in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since it has not been studied in this population and \na large increase in systemic exposure is anticipated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ivabradine for the treatment of chronic heart failure in children aged below \n18 years have not been established. \nAvailable data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made. \n \nMethod of administration \nTablets must be taken orally twice daily, i.e. once in the morning and once in the evening during meals \n(see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\u2012 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2012 Resting heart rate below 70 beats per minute prior to treatment. \n\u2012 Cardiogenic shock. \n\u2012 Acute myocardial infarction. \n\u2012 Severe hypotension (< 90/50 mmHg). \n\u2012 Severe hepatic insufficiency. \n\u2012 Sick sinus syndrome. \n\u2012 Sino-atrial block. \n\u2012 Unstable or acute heart failure. \n\u2012 Pacemaker dependent (heart rate imposed exclusively by the pacemaker). \n\u2012 Unstable angina. \n\u2012 AV-block of 3rd degree. \n\u2012 Combination with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), \nHIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n\u2012 Combination with verapamil or diltiazem which are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with heart rate \nreducing properties (see section 4.5).  \n\n\u2012 Pregnancy, lactation and women of child-bearing potential not using appropriate contraceptive \nmeasures (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSpecial warnings \nLack of benefit on clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina pectoris \nIvabradine is indicated only for symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris because \nivabradine has no benefits on cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) \n(see section 5.1). \n \nMeasurement of heart rate \nGiven that the heart rate may fluctuate considerably over time, serial heart rate measurements, ECG \nor ambulatory 24-hour monitoring should be considered when determining resting heart rate before \ninitiation of ivabradine treatment and in patients on treatment with ivabradine when titration is considered. \nThis also applies to patients with a low heart rate, in particular when heart rate decreases below 50 bpm, \nor after dose reduction (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nIvabradine is not effective in the treatment or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and likely loses its \nefficacy when a tachyarrhythmia occurs (e.g. ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia). Ivabradine \nis therefore not recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias that interfere \nwith sinus node function. \nIn patients treated with ivabradine the risk of developing atrial fibrillation is increased (see section 4.8). \nAtrial fibrillation has been more common in patients using concomitantly amiodarone or potent class I \nanti-arrhythmics. It is recommended to regularly clinically monitor ivabradine treated patients \nfor the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (sustained or paroxysmal), which should also include ECG \nmonitoring if clinically indicated (e.g. in case of exacerbated angina, palpitations, irregular pulse). \nPatients should be informed of signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation and be advised to contact their \nphysician if these occur. \nIf atrial fibrillation develops during treatment, the balance of benefits and risks of continued ivabradine \ntreatment should be carefully reconsidered. \nChronic heart failure patients with intraventricular conduction defects (bundle branch block left, bundle \nbranch block right) and ventricular dyssynchrony should be monitored closely. \n \nUse in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree \nIvabradine is not recommended in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree. \n \nUse in patients with a low heart rate \nIvabradine must not be initiated in patients with a pre-treatment resting heart rate below 70 beats per \nminute (see section 4.3). \nIf, during treatment, resting heart rate decreases persistently below 50 bpm or the patient experiences \nsymptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated \ndownward or treatment discontinued if heart rate below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist \n(see section 4.2). \n \nCombination with calcium channel blockers \nConcomitant use of ivabradine with heart rate reducing calcium channel blockers such as verapamil \nor diltiazem is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). No safety issue has been raised \non the combination of ivabradine with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nas amlodipine. Additional efficacy of ivabradine in combination with dihydropyridine calcium channel \nblockers has not been established (see section 5.1). \n \nChronic heart failure \nHeart failure must be stable before considering ivabradine treatment. Ivabradine should be used with \ncaution in heart failure patients with NYHA functional classification IV due to limited amount of data \nin this population. \n \nStroke \nThe use of ivabradine is not recommended immediately after a stroke since no data is available in these \nsituations. \n \nVisual function \nIvabradine influences retinal function. There is no evidence of a toxic effect of  long-term ivabradine \ntreatment on the retina (see section 5.1). Cessation of treatment should be considered if any unexpected \ndeterioration in visual function occurs. Caution should be exercised in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. \n \nPrecautions for use \nPatients with hypotension \nLimited data are available in patients with mild to moderate hypotension, and ivabradine should therefore \nbe used with caution in these patients. Ivabradine is contra-indicated in patients with severe hypotension \n(blood pressure < 90/50 mmHg) (see section 4.3). \n \nAtrial fibrillation \u2013 cardiac arrhythmias \nThere is no evidence of risk of (excessive) bradycardia on return to sinus rhythm when pharmacological \ncardioversion is initiated in patients treated with ivabradine. However, in the absence of extensive data, \nnon-urgent DC-cardioversion should be considered 24 hours after the last dose of ivabradine. \n \nUse in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products \nThe use of ivabradine in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts should be avoided (see section 4.5). If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac \nmonitoring is needed. \nHeart rate reduction, as caused by ivabradine, may exacerbate QT prolongation, which may give rise \nto severe arrhythmias, in particular Torsade de pointes. \n \nHypertensive patients requiring blood pressure treatment modifications \nIn the SHIFT trial more patients experienced episodes of increased blood pressure while treated with \nivabradine (7.1%) compared to patients treated with placebo (6.1%). These episodes occurred most \nfrequently shortly after blood pressure treatment was modified, were transient, and did not affect \nthe treatment effect of ivabradine. When treatment modifications are made in chronic heart failure patients \ntreated with ivabradine blood pressure should be monitored at an appropriate interval (see section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \nConcomitant use not recommended \nQT prolonging medicinal products \n\n\u2012 Cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, bepridil, sotalol, \nibutilide, amiodarone). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n\u2012 Non-cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole, \nmefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine, cisapride, intravenous erythromycin). \n\nThe concomitant use of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products with \nivabradine should be avoided since QT prolongation may be exacerbated by heart rate reduction. \nIf the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use with precaution \nPotassium-depleting diuretics (thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics) \nHypokalaemia can increase the risk of arrhythmia. As ivabradine may cause bradycardia, the resulting \ncombination of hypokalaemia and bradycardia is a predisposing factor to the onset of severe arrhythmias, \nespecially in patients with long QT syndrome, whether congenital or substance-induced. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \nCytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) \nIvabradine is metabolised by CYP3A4 only and it is a very weak inhibitor of this cytochrome. Ivabradine \nwas shown not to influence the metabolism and plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates (mild, \nmoderate and strong inhibitors). CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are liable to interact with ivabradine and \ninfluence its metabolism and pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. Drug-drug interaction \nstudies have established that CYP3A4 inhibitors increase ivabradine plasma concentrations, while \ninducers decrease them. Increased plasma concentrations of ivabradine may be associated with the risk \nof excessive bradycardia (see section 4.4). \n \nContra-indication of concomitant use \nThe concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), \nmacrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease \ninhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone is contra-indicated (see section 4.3). The potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) and josamycin (1 g twice daily) increased ivabradine mean \nplasma exposure by 7 to 8-fold. \n \nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors: specific interaction studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown \nthat the combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents diltiazem or verapamil resulted \nin an increase in ivabradine exposure (2 to 3-fold increase in AUC) and an additional heart rate reduction \nof 5 bpm. The concomitant use of ivabradine with these medicinal products is contraindicated (see section \n4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nGrapefruit juice: ivabradine exposure was increased by 2-fold following the co-administration with \ngrapefruit juice. Therefore the intake of grapefruit juice should be avoided. \n \nConcomitant use with precautions \n\n\u2012 Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: the concomitant use of ivabradine with other moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g. fluconazole) may be considered at the starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and \nif resting heart rate is above 70 bpm, with monitoring of heart rate. \n\n\u2012 CYP3A4 inducers: CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, Hypericum \nperforatum [St. John\u2019s Wort]) may decrease ivabradine exposure and activity. The concomitant use \nof CYP3A4 inducing medicinal products may require an adjustment of the dose of ivabradine. \nThe combination of ivabradine 10 mg twice daily with St. John\u2019s Wort was shown to reduce \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nivabradine AUC by half. The intake of St. John\u2019s Wort should be restricted during the treatment with \nivabradine. \n\n \nOther concomitant use \nSpecific drug-drug interaction studies have shown no clinically significant effect of the following \nmedicinal products on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivabradine: proton pump inhibitors \n(omeprazole, lansoprazole), sildenafil, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin), dihydropyridine \ncalcium channel blockers (amlodipine, lacidipine), digoxin and warfarin. In addition there was \nno clinically significant effect of ivabradine on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, amlodipine, \nlacidipine, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin and \non the pharmacodynamics of aspirin. \nIn pivotal phase III clinical trials the following medicinal products were routinely combined \nwith ivabradine with no evidence of safety concerns: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, \nangiotensin II antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretics, anti-aldosterone agents, short and long acting nitrates, \nHMG CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, proton pump inhibitors, oral antidiabetics, aspirin and other anti-\nplatelet medicinal products. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of child-bearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures during treatment \n(see section 4.3). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ivabradine in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. These studies have shown embryotoxic \nand teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, ivabradine \nis contra-indicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nAnimal studies indicate that ivabradine is excreted in milk. Therefore, ivabradine is contra-indicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Women that need treatment with ivabradine should stop breast-\nfeeding, and choose for another way of feeding their child. \n \nFertility \nStudies in rats have shown no effect on fertility in males and females (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nA specific study to assess the possible influence of ivabradine on driving performance has been performed \nin healthy volunteers where no alteration of the driving performance was evidenced. However, in post-\nmarketing experience, cases of impaired driving ability due to visual symptoms have been reported. \nIvabradine may cause transient luminous phenomena consisting mainly of phosphenes (see section 4.8). \nThe possible occurrence of such luminous phenomena should be taken into account when driving or using \nmachines in situations where sudden variations in light intensity may occur, especially when driving \nat night. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nIvabradine has no influence on the ability to use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIvabradine has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 45,000 participants. \nThe most common adverse reactions with ivabradine, luminous phenomena (phosphenes) and bradycardia, \nare dose dependent and related to the pharmacological effect of the medicinal product. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical trials and are ranked using \nthe following frequency: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Preferred Term \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon Eosinophilia \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Uncommon Hyperuricaemia \nNervous system disorders Common Headache, generally during the first month \n\nof treatment \nDizziness, possibly related to bradycardia \n\nUncommon* Syncope, possibly related to bradycardia \nEye disorders Very common Luminous phenomena (phosphenes) \n\nCommon Blurred vision \nUncommon* Diplopia \n\nVisual impairment \nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon Vertigo \nCardiac disorders Common Bradycardia \n\nAV 1st degree block (ECG prolonged PQ \ninterval) \nVentricular extrasystoles \nAtrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Palpitations \nSupraventricular extrasystoles \n\nVery rare AV 2nd and 3rd degree block \nSick sinus syndrome \n\nVascular disorders Common Uncontrolled blood pressure \nUncommon* Hypotension, possibly related to bradycardia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea \nConstipation \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain* \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Preferred Term \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon* Angioedema \nRash \n\nRare* Erythema \nPruritus \nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Muscle cramps \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nUncommon* Asthenia, possibly related to bradycardia \nFatigue, possibly related to bradycardia \n\nRare* Malaise, possibly related to bradycardia \nInvestigations Uncommon Elevated creatinine in blood \n\nECG prolonged QT interval \n* Frequency calculated from clinical trials for adverse events detected from spontaneous report. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nLuminous phenomena (phosphenes) were reported by 14.5% of patients, described as a transient enhanced \nbrightness in a limited area of the visual field. They are usually triggered by sudden variations in light \nintensity. Phosphenes may also be described as a halo, image decomposition (stroboscopic \nor kaleidoscopic effects), coloured bright lights, or multiple image (retinal persistency). The onset \nof phosphenes is generally within the first two months of treatment after which they may occur repeatedly. \nPhosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity. All phosphenes resolved during \nor after treatment, of which a majority (77.5%) resolved during treatment. Fewer than 1% of patients \nchanged their daily routine or discontinued the treatment in relation with phosphenes. \n \nBradycardia was reported by 3.3% of patients particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of treatment \ninitiation. 0.5% of patients experienced a severe bradycardia below or equal to 40 bpm. \n \nIn the SIGNIFY study atrial fibrillation was observed in 5.3% of patients taking ivabradine compared \nto 3.8% in the placebo group. In a pooled analysis of all the Phase II/III double blind controlled clinical \ntrials with a duration of at least 3 months including more than 40,000 patients, the incidence of atrial \nfibrillation was 4.86% in ivabradine treated patients compared to 4.08% in controls, corresponding \nto a hazard ratio of 1.26, 95% CI [1.15 \u2013 1.39]. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nOverdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia (see section 4.8). \n \nManagement \nSevere bradycardia should be treated symptomatically in a specialised environment. In the event \nof bradycardia with poor haemodynamic tolerance, symptomatic treatment including intravenous beta-\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nstimulating medicinal products such as isoprenaline may be considered. Temporary cardiac electrical \npacing may be instituted if required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, other cardiac preparations; \nATC code: C01EB17. \n \nMechanism of action \nIvabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent, acting by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac \npacemaker If current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in the sinus node and regulates \nheart rate. The cardiac effects are specific to the sinus node with no effect on intra-atrial, atrioventricular \nor intraventricular conduction times, nor on myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarisation. \n \nIvabradine can interact also with the retinal current Ih which closely resembles cardiac If. It participates \nin the temporal resolution of the visual system, by curtailing the retinal response to bright light stimuli. \nUnder triggering circumstances (e.g. rapid changes in luminosity), partial inhibition of Ih by ivabradine \nunderlies the luminous phenomena that may be occasionally experienced by patients. Luminous \nphenomena (phosphenes) are described as a transient enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual \nfield (see section 4.8). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe main pharmacodynamic property of ivabradine in humans is a specific dose dependent reduction \nin heart rate. Analysis of heart rate reduction with doses up to 20 mg twice daily indicates a trend towards \na plateau effect which is consistent with a reduced risk of severe bradycardia below 40 bpm (see section \n4.8). \nAt usual recommended doses, heart rate reduction is approximately 10 bpm at rest and during exercise. \nThis leads to a reduction in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption. Ivabradine does not \ninfluence intracardiac conduction, contractility (no negative inotropic effect) or ventricular repolarisation: \n\n\u2012 In clinical electrophysiology studies, ivabradine had no effect on atrioventricular or intraventricular \nconduction times or corrected QT intervals. \n\n\u2012 In patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 30 and \n45%), ivabradine did not have any deleterious influence on LVEF. \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was studied in five double-blind randomised \ntrials (three versus placebo, and one each versus atenolol and amlodipine). These trials included a total \nof 4,111 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, of whom 2,617 received ivabradine. \n \nIvabradine 5 mg twice daily was shown to be effective on exercise test parameters within 3 to 4 weeks \nof treatment. Efficacy was confirmed with 7.5 mg twice daily. In particular, the additional benefit over \n5 mg twice daily was established in a reference-controlled study versus atenolol: total exercise duration \nat trough was increased by about 1 minute after one month of treatment with 5 mg twice daily and further \nimproved by almost 25 seconds after an additional 3-month period with forced titration to 7.5 mg twice \ndaily. In this study, the antianginal and anti-ischaemic benefits of ivabradine were confirmed in patients \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\naged 65 years or more. The efficacy of 5 and 7.5 mg twice daily was consistent across studies on exercise \ntest parameters (total exercise duration, time to limiting angina, time to angina onset and time to 1 mm ST \nsegment depression) and was associated with a decrease of about 70% in the rate of angina attacks. \nThe twice-daily dosing regimen of ivabradine gave uniform efficacy over 24 hours. \n \nIn a 889-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine given on top of atenolol 50 mg o.d. \nshowed additional efficacy on all ETT parameters at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral \nintake). \n \nIn a 725-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on top \nof amlodipine 10 mg o.d. at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral intake) while an additional \nefficacy was shown at peak (3 \u2013 4 hours after oral intake). \n \nIn a 1,277-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant additional efficacy on response to treatment (defined as a decrease of at least 3 angina \nattacks per week and/or an increase in the time to 1 mm ST segment depression of at least 60 s during \na treadmill ETT) on top of amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or nifedipine GITS 30 mg o.d. at the trough of drug \nactivity (12 hours after oral ivabradine intake) over a 6-week treatment period (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.0 \n\u2013 1.7]; p = 0.012). Ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on secondary endpoints of ETT \nparameters at the trough of drug activity while an additional efficacy was shown at peak (3 \u2013 4 hours \nafter oral ivabradine intake). \n \nIvabradine efficacy was fully maintained throughout the 3- or 4-month treatment periods in the efficacy \ntrials. There was no evidence of pharmacological tolerance (loss of efficacy) developing during treatment \nnor of rebound phenomena after abrupt treatment discontinuation. The antianginal and anti-ischaemic \neffects of ivabradine were associated with dose-dependent reductions in heart rate and with a significant \ndecrease in rate pressure product (heart rate \u00d7 systolic blood pressure) at rest and during exercise. \nThe effects on blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance were minor and not clinically significant. \n \nA sustained reduction of heart rate was demonstrated in patients treated with ivabradine for at least one \nyear (n = 713). No influence on glucose or lipid metabolism was observed. \n \nThe antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was preserved in diabetic patients (n = 457) \nwith a similar safety profile as compared to the overall population. \n \nA large outcome study, BEAUTIFUL, was performed in 10,917 patients with coronary artery disease and \nleft ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) on top of optimal background therapy with 86.9% of patients \nreceiving beta-blockers. The main efficacy criterion was the composite of cardiovascular death, \nhospitalization for acute MI or hospitalization for new onset or worsening heart failure. The study showed \nno difference in the rate of the primary composite outcome in the ivabradine group by comparison \nto the placebo group (relative risk ivabradine:placebo: 1.00, p = 0.945). \nIn a post-hoc subgroup of patients with symptomatic angina at randomisation (n = 1,507), no safety signal \nwas identified regarding cardiovascular death, hospitalization for acute MI or heart failure (ivabradine \n12.0% versus placebo 15.5%, p = 0.05). \n \nA large outcome study, SIGNIFY, was performed in 19,102 patients with coronary artery disease and \nwithout clinical heart failure (LVEF > 40%), on top of optimal background therapy. A therapeutic scheme \nhigher than the approved posology was used (starting dose 7.5 mg b.i.d. (5 mg b.i.d., if age \u2265 75 years) \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nand titration up to 10 mg b.i.d.). The main efficacy criterion was the composite of cardiovascular death \nor non-fatal MI. The study showed no difference in the rate of the primary composite endpoint (PCE) \nin the ivabradine group by comparison to the placebo group (relative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.08, p = \n0.197). Bradycardia was reported by 17.9 % of patients in the ivabradine group (2.1% in the placebo \ngroup). Verapamil, diltiazem or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors were received by 7.1% of patients during \nthe study. \n \nA small statistically significant increase in the PCE was observed in a pre-specified subgroup of patients \nwith angina patients in CCS class II or higher at baseline (n = 12,049) (annual rates 3.4% versus 2.9%, \nrelative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.18, p = 0.018), but not in the subgroup of the overall angina population \nin CCS class \u2265 I (n = 14,286) (relative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.11, p = 0.110). \n \nThe higher than approved dose used in the study did not fully explain these findings. \n \nThe SHIFT study was a large multicentre, international, randomised double-blind placebo controlled \noutcome trial conducted in 6,505 adult patients with stable chronic CHF (for \u2265 4 weeks), NYHA class II \nto IV, with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF \u2264 35%) and a resting heart rate \u2265 70 bpm. \nPatients received standard care including beta-blockers (89%), ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II \nantagonists (91%), diuretics (83%), and anti-aldosterone agents (60%). In the ivabradine group, 67% \nof patients were treated with 7.5 mg twice a day. The median follow-up duration was 22.9 months. \nTreatment with ivabradine was associated with an average reduction in heart rate of 15 bpm \nfrom a baseline value of 80 bpm. The difference in heart rate between ivabradine and placebo arms was \n10.8 bpm at 28 days, 9.1 bpm at 12 months and 8.3 bpm at 24 months. \nThe study demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant relative risk reduction of 18% in the rate \nof the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation for worsening heart \nfailure (hazard ratio: 0.82, 95% CI [0.75; 0.90], p < 0.0001) apparent within 3 months of initiation of \ntreatment. The absolute risk reduction was 4.2%. The results on the primary endpoint are mainly driven by \nthe heart failure endpoints, hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (absolute risk reduced by 4.7%) \nand deaths from heart failure (absolute risk reduced by 1.1%). \n \nTreatment effect on the primary composite endpoint, its components and secondary endpoints \n\n Ivabradine \n(N = 3,241) \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 3,264) \nn (%) \n\nHazard Ratio \n[95% CI] \n\np-value \n\nPrimary composite endpoint 793 (24.47) 937 (28.71) 0.82 [0.75; 0.90] < 0.0001 \nComponents of the composite: \n\u2012 CV death \n\u2012 Hospitalisation for worsening HF \n\n \n449 (13.85) \n514 (15.86) \n\n \n491 (15.04) \n672 (20.59) \n\n \n0.91 [0.80; 1.03] \n0.74 [0.66; 0.83] \n\n \n0.128 \n< 0.0001 \n\nOther secondary endpoints     \n\u2012 All cause death \n\u2012 Death from HF \n\u2012 Hospitalisation for any cause \n\u2012 Hospitalisation for CV reason \n\n503 (15.52) \n113 (3.49) \n1,231 (37.98) \n977 (30.15) \n\n552 (16.91) \n151 (4.63) \n1,356 (41.54) \n1,122 (34.38) \n\n0.90 [0.80; 1.02] \n0.74 [0.58;0.94] \n0.89 [0.82;0.96] \n0.85 [0.78; 0.92] \n\n0.092 \n0.014 \n0.003 \n0.0002 \n\n \nThe reduction in the primary endpoint was observed consistently irrespective of gender, NYHA class, \nischaemic or non-ischaemic heart failure aetiology and of background history of diabetes or hypertension. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nIn the subgroup of patients with HR \u2265 75 bpm (n = 4,150), a greater reduction was observed \nin the primary composite endpoint of 24% (hazard ratio: 0.76, 95% CI [0.68; 0.85], p < 0.0001) \nand for other secondary endpoints, including all cause death (hazard ratio: 0.83, 95% CI [0.72; 0.96], \np = 0.0109) and CV death (hazard ratio: 0.83, 95% CI [0.71; 0.97], p = 0.0166). In this subgroup \nof patients, the safety profile of ivabradine is in line with the one of the overall population. \n \nA significant effect was observed on the primary composite endpoint in the overall group of patients \nreceiving beta-blocker therapy (hazard ratio: 0.85, 95% CI [0.76; 0.94]). In the subgroup of patients with \nHR \u2265 75 bpm and on the recommended target dose of beta-blocker, no statistically significant benefit was \nobserved on the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio: 0.97, 95% CI [0.74; 1.28]) and other secondary \nendpoints, including hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (hazard ratio: 0.79, 95% CI [0.56; 1.10]) \nor death from heart failure (hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI [0.31; 1.53]). \n \nThere was a significant improvement in NYHA class at last recorded value, 887 (28%) of patients \non ivabradine improved versus 776 (24%) of patients on placebo (p = 0.001). \n \nIn a 97-patient  randomised placebo-controlled study, the data collected during specific ophthalmologic \ninvestigations, aiming at documenting the function of the cone and rod systems and the ascending visual \npathway (i.e. electroretinogram, static and kinetic visual fields, colour vision, visual acuity), in patients \ntreated with ivabradine for chronic stable angina pectoris over 3 years, did not show any retinal toxicity. \n \nPaediatric population \nA randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study was performed in 116 paediatric patients \n(17 aged [6 \u2013 12] months, 36 aged [1 \u2013 3] years and 63 aged [3 \u2013 18] years) with CHF and dilated \ncardiomyopathy (DCM) on top of optimal background treatment. 74 received ivabradine (ratio 2:1). \nThe starting dose was 0.02 mg/kg b.i.d. in age-subset [6 \u2013 12] months, 0.05 mg/kg b.i.d. in [1 \u2013 3] years \nand [3 \u2013 18] years < 40 kg, and 2.5 mg b.i.d. in [3 \u2013 18] years and \u2265 40 kg. The dose was adapted \ndepending on the therapeutic response with maximum doses of 0.2 mg/kg b.i.d., 0.3 mg/kg b.i.d. and \n15 mg b.i.d., respectively. In this study, ivabradine was administered as oral liquid formulation or tablet \ntwice daily. The absence of pharmacokinetic difference between the 2 formulations was shown \nin an open-label randomised two-period cross-over study in 24 adult healthy volunteers. \nA 20% heart rate reduction, without bradycardia, was achieved by 69.9% of patients in the ivabradine \ngroup versus 12.2% in the placebo group during the titration period of 2 to 8 weeks (Odds Ratio: E = \n17.24, 95% CI [5.91 ; 50.30]). \nThe mean ivabradine doses allowing to achieve a 20% HRR were 0.13\u00b10.04 mg/kg b.i.d., 0.10\u00b10.04 \nmg/kg b.i.d. and 4.1\u00b12.2 mg b.i.d. in the age subsets [1 \u2013 3] years, [3 \u2013 18] years and < 40 kg and \n[3 \u2013 18] years and \u2265 40 kg, respectively. \nMean LVEF increased from 31.8% to 45.3% at M012 in ivabradine group versus 35.4% to 42.3% \nin the placebo group. There was an improvement in NYHA class in 37.7% of ivabradine patients \nversus 25.0% in the placebo group. These improvements were not statistically significant. \nThe safety profile, over one year, was similar to the one described in adult CHF patients. \n \nThe long-term effects of ivabradine on growth, puberty and general development as well as the long- \nterm efficacy of therapy with ivabradine in childhood to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality \nhave not been studied. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nivabradine in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of angina pectoris. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nivabradine in children aged 0 to less than 6 months for the treatment of chronic heart failure. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nUnder physiological conditions, ivabradine is rapidly released from tablets and is highly water-soluble \n(> 10 mg/mL). Ivabradine is the S-enantiomer with no bioconversion demonstrated in vivo. The N-\ndesmethylated derivative of ivabradine has been identified as the main active metabolite in humans. \n \nAbsorption and bioavailability \nIvabradine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma level \nreached in about 1 hour under fasting condition. The absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablets \nis around 40%, due to first-pass effect in the gut and liver. \nFood delayed absorption by approximately 1 hour, and increased plasma exposure by 20 to 30%. \nThe intake of the tablet during meals is recommended in order to decrease intra-individual variability \nin exposure (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nIvabradine is approximately 70% plasma protein bound and the volume of distribution at steady-state \nis close to 100 L in patients. The maximum plasma concentration following chronic administration \nat the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily is 22 ng/mL (CV = 29%). The average plasma concentration \nis 10 ng/mL (CV = 38%) at steady-state. \n \nBiotransformation \nIvabradine is extensively metabolised by the liver and the gut by oxidation through cytochrome P4503A4 \n(CYP3A4) only. The major active metabolite is the N-desmethylated derivative (S 18982) with \nan exposure about 40% of that of the parent compound. The metabolism of this active metabolite also \ninvolves CYP3A4. Ivabradine has low affinity for CYP3A4, shows no clinically relevant CYP3A4 \ninduction or inhibition and is therefore unlikely to modify CYP3A4 substrate metabolism or plasma \nconcentrations. Inversely, potent inhibitors and inducers may substantially affect ivabradine plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nIvabradine is eliminated with a main half-life of 2 hours (70 \u2013 75% of the AUC) in plasma \nand an effective half-life of 11 hours. The total clearance is about 400 mL/min and the renal clearance \nis about 70 mL/min. Excretion of metabolites occurs to a similar extent via faeces and urine. About 4% \nof an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine. \n \nLinearity/non linearity \nThe kinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5 \u2013 24 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic differences (AUC and Cmax) have been observed between elderly (\u2265 65 years) or very \nelderly patients (\u2265 75 years) and the overall population (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nThe impact of renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 15 to 60 mL/min) on ivabradine \npharmacokinetic is minimal, in relation with the low contribution of renal clearance (about 20%) to total \nelimination for both ivabradine and its main metabolite S 18982 (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score up to 7) unbound AUC of ivabradine and \nthe main active metabolite were about 20% higher than in subjects with normal hepatic function. Data are \ninsufficient to draw conclusions in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of ivabradine in paediatric chronic heart failure patients aged 6 months \nto less than 18 years is similar to the pharmacokinetics described in adults when a titration scheme based \non age and weight is applied. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship \nPK/PD relationship analysis has shown that heart rate decreases almost linearly with increasing ivabradine \nand S 18982 plasma concentrations for doses of up to 15 \u2013 20 mg twice daily. At higher doses, \nthe decrease in heart rate is no longer proportional to ivabradine plasma concentrations and tends to reach \na plateau. High exposures to ivabradine that may occur when ivabradine is given in combination with \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an excessive decrease in heart rate although this risk is reduced \nwith moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \nThe PK/PD relationship of ivabradine in paediatric chronic heart failure patients aged 6 months to less \nthan 18 years is similar to the PK/PD relationship described in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Reproductive toxicity studies \nshowed no effect of ivabradine on fertility in male and female rats. When pregnant animals were treated \nduring organogenesis at exposures close to therapeutic doses, there was a higher incidence of foetuses \nwith cardiac defects in the rat and a small number of foetuses with ectrodactylia in the rabbit. \nIn dogs given ivabradine (doses of 2, 7 or 24 mg/kg/day) for one year, reversible changes in retinal \nfunction were observed but were not associated with any damage to ocular structures. These data are \nconsistent with the pharmacological effect of ivabradine related to its interaction with hyperpolarisation-\nactivated Ih currents in the retina, which share extensive homology with the cardiac pacemaker If current. \nOther long-term repeat dose and carcinogenicity studies revealed no clinically relevant changes. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \nThe environmental risk assessment of ivabradine has been conducted in accordance to European \nguidelines on ERA. \nOutcomes of these evaluations support the lack of environmental risk of ivabradine and ivabradine does \nnot pose a threat to the environment. \n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ivabradine Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIvabradine Zentiva (ivabradine) is a heart medicine used to treat: \n\n\u2012 Symptomatic stable angina pectoris (which causes chest pain) in adult patients whose heart rate \nis over or equal to 70 beats per minute. It is used in adult patients who do not tolerate or cannot take \nheart medicines called beta-blockers. It is also used in combination with beta-blockers in adult \npatients whose condition is not fully controlled with a beta-blocker. \n\n\u2012 Chronic heart failure in adult patients whose heart rate is over or equal to 75 beats per minute. \nIt is used in combination with standard therapy, including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blockers \nare contraindicated or not tolerated. \n\n \nAbout stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as \u201cangina\u201d) \nStable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen. It usually \nappears between 40 and 50 years of age. The most common symptom of angina is chest pain \nor discomfort. Angina is more likely to happen when the heart beats faster in situations such as exercise, \nemotion, exposure to the cold or after eating. This increase in heart rate can cause the chest pain in people \nwho suffer from angina. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nAbout chronic heart failure \nChronic heart failure is a heart disease which happens when your heart cannot pump enough blood \nto the rest of your body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, tiredness \nand ankle swelling. \n \nHow does Ivabradine Zentiva work? \nIvabradine Zentiva mainly works by reducing the heart rate by a few beats per minute. This lowers \nthe heart\u02bcs need for oxygen especially in the situations when an angina attack is more likely to happen. \nIn this way Ivabradine Zentiva helps to control and reduce the number of angina attacks. \nFurthermore as elevated heart rate adversely affects the heart functioning and vital prognosis in patients \nwith chronic heart failure, the specific heart rate lowering action of ivabradine helps to improve the heart \nfunctioning and vital prognosis in these patients. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ivabradine Zentiva \n \nDo not take Ivabradine Zentiva \n\n\u2012 If you are allergic to ivabradine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in

exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. ivabradine zentiva should be taken during meals. if you are being treated for stable angina pectoris the starting dose should not exceed one tablet of ivabradine zentiva 5 mg twice daily. if you still have angina symptoms and if you have tolerated the 5 mg twice daily dose well, the dose may be increased. the maintenance dose should not exceed 7.5 mg twice daily. your doctor will prescribe the right dose for you. the usual dose is one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. in some cases (e.g. if you are elderly), your doctor may prescribe half the dose i.e., one half 5 mg tablet of ivabradine zentiva 5 mg (corresponding to 2.5 mg ivabradine) in the morning and one half 5 mg tablet in the evening. if you are being treated for chronic heart failure the usual recommended starting dose is one tablet of ivabradine zentiva 5 mg twice daily increasing if necessary to one tablet of ivabradine zentiva 7.5 mg twice daily. your doctor will decide the right dose for you. the usual dose is one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. in some cases (e.g. if you
