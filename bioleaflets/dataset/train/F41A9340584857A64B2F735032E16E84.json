NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ 20 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 20 mg tasimelteon. \n\n \nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 183.25 mg of lactose (as anhydrous) and 0.03 mg of Orange Yellow S (E110). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule \n\n \n\nDark blue opaque, hard capsule (dimensions 19.4 mm x 6.9 mm) marked with \u2018VANDA 20 mg\u2019 in white \n\nink.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) in totally blind \n\nadults.   \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nDose and timing \n\nThe recommended dose is 20 mg (1 capsule) tasimelteon per day taken one hour before bedtime, at the same \n\ntime every night.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ is intended for chronic use. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for individuals older than 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nTasimelteon has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore \n\ncaution is recommended when prescribing tasimelteon to patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of tasimelteon in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been \n\nestablished.  No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nOral use. Hard capsules should be swallowed whole. Avoid breaking as the powder has an unpleasant taste. \n\n \n\nTasimelteon should be taken without food; if patients eat a high-fat meal, it is recommended to wait at least 2 \n\nhours before taking tasimelteon (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAfter taking tasimelteon, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed.   \n\n \n\n \n\nCaution should be used when administering tasimelteon in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong \n\nCYP1A2 inhibitors, particularly those which also inhibit other enzymes involved in the clearance of \n\ntasimelteon because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and greater risk of adverse \n\nreactions (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCaution should be used when administering tasimelteon in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 \n\ninducers because of a potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy (see section \n\n4.5). \n\nPatients should be instructed to initiate tasimelteon treatment without regard to circadian phase.  Physicians \n\nshould evaluate patient response to tasimelteon 3 months after treatment initiation utilising a clinician \n\ninterview to assess their overall functioning with an emphasis on sleep-wake complaints.   \n\n \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance,  \n\ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ hard capsules contain the azo colouring agent Orange Yellow S (E110), which may cause allergic \n\nreactions.  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect tasimelteon \n\nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are enzymes identified to play a role in the metabolism of tasimelteon, with a minor \n\nrole for CYP2C9/C19.  Medicinal products that inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 have been shown to alter the \n\nmetabolism of tasimelteon in vivo.   \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n  \n\nStrong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin)  \n\nCaution should be used when administering tasimelteon in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong \n\nCYP1A2 inhibitors such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon \n\nexposure and greater risk of adverse reactions: the AUC0-inf and Cmax of tasimelteon increased by 7-fold and \n\n2-fold, respectively, when co-administered with fluvoxamine 50 mg (after 6 days of fluvoxamine 50 mg per \n\nday). This is deemed even more important for strong CYP1A2 inhibitors also inhibiting other enzymes \n\ninvolved in the clearance of tasimelteon (e.g. fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin). \n\n \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole)  \n\nTasimelteon exposure was increased by approximately 50% when co-administered with ketoconazole \n\n400 mg (after 5 days of ketoconazole 400 mg per day).  The clinical relevance of this single factor is unclear, \n\nbut with increased exposure caution is recommended to monitor the patient. \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) \n\nUse of tasimelteon should be avoided in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers because of a \n\npotentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy: the exposure of tasimelteon \n\ndecreased by approximately 90% when co-administered with rifampin 600 mg (after 11 days of rifampin \n\n600 mg per day). \n\n \n\nSmoking (moderate CYP1A2 inducer) \n\nTasimelteon exposure decreased by approximately 40% in smokers compared to non-smokers (see section \n\n5.2).    The patient should be instructed to cease or reduce smoking while taking tasimelteon. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers \n\nThe efficacy of tasimelteon may be reduced in patients with concomitant administration of beta adrenergic \n\nreceptor antagonists. Monitoring of efficacy is recommended where if efficacy is not achieved by a patient \n\non beta blocker medication, the physician may consider whether a substitution of another non-beta-blocker \n\nmedication for the beta blocker is warranted or discontinue the use of Hetlioz. \n\n \n\nPotential effect of alcohol on tasimelteon \n\n \n\nIn a study of 28 healthy volunteers, a single dose of ethanol (0.6 g/kg for women and 0.7 g/kg for men) was \n\nco-administered with a 20 mg dose of tasimelteon. On some psychomotor test measures (intoxication, drunk, \n\nalertness/drowsiness, balance platform test), there was a trend towards greater effects of tasimelteon plus \n\nethanol versus ethanol alone, but the effects were not deemed significant. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of tasimelteon in pregnant women. In animal studies, \n\nadministration of tasimelteon during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofoetal mortality, \n\nneurobehavioural impairment, and decreased growth and development in offspring) at doses greater than \n\nthose used clinically. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of tasimelteon during \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether tasimelteon/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child \n\ncannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \n\nfrom tasimelteon therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effects of tasimelteon on human fertility.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity \n\nstudies showed that oestrous cycles were prolonged in rats treated with high doses of tasimelteon, with no \n\neffect on mating performance or male fertility, and only a marginal effect on female fertility.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nTasimelteon may cause somnolence, and therefore may have an influence on driving and using machines.  \n\nAfter taking tasimelteon, patients should limit their activity to preparing to go to bed and not use machines \n\nbecause tasimelteon can impair performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (>3%) during clinical trials were headache (10.4%), somnolence \n\n(8.6%), nausea (4.0%), and dizziness (3.1%).  The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly \n\nmild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 2.3% of tasimelteon-treated patients. The most \n\nfrequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: somnolence (0.23%), nightmare (0.23%), and \n\nheadache (0.17%).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following are adverse reactions that were reported in tasimelteon-treated adult patients, derived from \n\npatient trials in 1772 patients treated with tasimelteon.  The following terms and frequencies are applied and \n\npresented by MedDRA System Organ Class: Very common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \n\nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000).  Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Adverse Drug Reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Common Uncommon \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \nSleep disorder, insomnia, \n\nabnormal dreams \nNightmare \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \nHeadache Somnolence, dizziness Dysguesia \n\nEar and labyrinth \n\ndisorders \n  Tinnitus \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n \n\nDyspepsia, nausea, dry \n\nmouth \n \n\nRenal and urinary \n\ndisorders \n  Pollakiuria \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministrative site \n\nconditions \n\n Fatigue Foggy feeling in head \n\nInvestigations  \nAlanine aminotransferase \n\nincreased \n\nAspartate aminotransferase \n\nincreased, gamma-glutamyl \n\ntransferase increased \n\n \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is limited clinical experience with the effects of an overdose of tasimelteon.  \n\n \n\nAs with the management of any overdose, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be used, \n\nalong with immediate gastric lavage, where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as \n\nneeded. Respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate vital signs should be monitored, and \n\ngeneral supportive measures employed. \n\n \n\nWhile haemodialysis was effective at clearing tasimelteon and the majority of its major metabolites in \n\npatients with renal impairment, it is not known if hemodialysis will effectively reduce exposure in the case of \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, melatonin receptor agonists, ATC code: N05CH03 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTasimelteon is a circadian regulator that resets the master body clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).  \n\nTasimelteon acts as a Dual Melatonin Receptor Agonist (DMRA) with selective agonist activity at the MT1 \n\nand MT2 receptors.  These receptors are thought to be involved in the control of circadian rhythms. \n\n \n\nThe master body clock regulates the circadian rhythms of hormones including melatonin and cortisol and \n\naligns/synchronises the physiological processes of the sleep-wake cycle and metabolic and cardiovascular \n\nhomeostasis. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nTasimelteon functions as a DMRA at the MT1 and MT2 receptors.  Tasimelteon exhibits a greater affinity for \n\nthe MT2 as compared to the MT1 receptor. The most abundant metabolites of tasimelteon have less than one-\n\ntenth of the binding affinity of the parent molecule for both the MT1 and MT2 receptors. \n\n  \n\nTasimelteon and its most abundant metabolites have no appreciable affinity for more than 160 other \n\npharmacologically relevant receptors. This includes the GABA receptor complex, the binding site for \n\nsedative hypnotics, and receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, \n\nand opiates.  \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe effectiveness of tasimelteon in the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) was \n\nestablished in two randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group studies (SET \n\nand RESET) in totally blind patients with Non-24. \n\n \n\nIn SET, 84 patients with Non-24 (median age 54 years) were randomised to receive tasimelteon 20 mg or \n\nplacebo, one hour prior to bedtime, at the same time every night for up to 6 months. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nRESET was a randomised withdrawal trial in 20 patients with Non-24 (median age 55 years) that was \n\ndesigned to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of tasimelteon after 12-weeks. Patients were treated for \n\napproximately 12 weeks with tasimelteon 20 mg one hour prior to bedtime, at the same time every night. \n\nPatients in whom the calculated time of peak melatonin level (melatonin acrophase) occurred at \n\napproximately the same time of day (in contrast to the expected daily delay) during the run-in phase were \n\nrandomised to receive placebo or continue daily treatment with tasimelteon 20 mg for 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nSET and RESET assessed entrainment of the master body clock as measured by aMT6s and cortisol.  Both \n\nstudies demonstrated the ability of tasimelteon to entrain the master body clock in patients with Non-24 and \n\nRESET demonstrated that continued daily dosing of tasimelteon is necessary to maintain entrainment. \n\n \n\n \n\nEntrainment in Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder \n\n \n\nIn SET, tasimelteon entrained circadian rhythms at month 1 at a significantly higher rate than placebo as \n\nmeasured by aMT6s and cortisol (20% vs. 2.6 % and 17.5% vs 2.6% respectively). Analyses of entrainment \n\nat month 7 in a subset of patients demonstrated that 59% of tasimelteon-treated patients entrained by month 7 \n\nindicating that response to treatment may take weeks or months for some patients to respond.  RESET \n\ndemonstrated the maintenance of entrainment with tasimelteon treatment compared to placebo withdrawal \n\n(aMT6s: 90% vs. 20% and cortisol: 80% vs. 20%). \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical Response in Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder \n\n \n\nThe effectiveness of tasimelteon in the treatment of clinical symptoms, including the circadian sleep-wake \n\ncycle and clinical global functioning in patients with Non-24 was established in SET and RESET (Table 3).  \n\nA composite scale of 4 measures of duration and timing of nighttime and daytime sleep and global \n\nfunctioning was used to evaluate clinical response in SET.  Entrainment plus a score \u22653 on this scale, called \n\nNon-24 Clinical Response Scale (N24CRS) was required to be classified as a clinical responder.  The \n\ncomponents of the scale can be found in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Non-24 Scale of Clinical Response \n\nAssessment Threshold of Response \n\nNighttime sleep on 25% most symptomatic nights \n>45 minutes increase in average nighttime sleep \n\nduration \n\nDaytime sleep on 25% most symptomatic days \n>45 minutes increase in average nighttime sleep \n\nduration \n\nTiming of sleep \n>30 minutes increase and a standard deviation <2 \n\nhours during double-masked phase \n\nCGI-C \n<2.0 from the average of Day 112 and Day 183 \n\ncompared to baseline \n\n \n\nClinical response in sleep-wake amount and timing measures \n\n \n\nSET and RESET evaluated the duration and timing of nighttime sleep and daytime naps via patient-recorded \n\ndiaries. During SET, patient diaries were recorded for an average of 88 days during screening and 133 days \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nduring randomisation.  During RESET, patient diaries were recorded for an average of 57 days during the \n\nrun-in phase and 59 days during the randomised-withdrawal phase. \n\n \n\nBecause symptoms of nighttime sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness are cyclical in patients with Non-24, \n\nwith severity varying according to the state of alignment of the individual patient\u2019s circadian rhythm with the \n\n24-hour day (least severe when fully aligned, most severe when 12 hours out of alignment), efficacy \n\nendpoints for nighttime total sleep time and daytime nap duration were based on the 25% of nights with the \n\nleast nighttime sleep, and the 25% of days with the most daytime nap time. In SET, patients in the \n\ntasimelteon group had, at baseline, an average 195 minutes of nighttime sleep and 137 minutes of daytime \n\nnap time on the 25% of most symptomatic nights and days, respectively.  The average timing of sleep \n\nrelative to an individual\u2019s desired period for consolidated sleep over at least one circadian period was \n\nassessed.  Treatment with tasimelteon resulted in a significant improvement, compared with placebo, for all \n\nof these endpoints in SET and RESET (see Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 3: Effects of Tasimelteon 20 mg Treatment on Clinical Response in Non-24 \n\n \nTasimelteon 20 mg Placebo \n\n% \n\nDifference \np-value \n\nSET Study  \n\nClinical response (Entrainment + N24CRS \n\n\u22653)(1) \n9/38 (23.7) 0/34 (0.0) 23.7 0.0028 \n\nN24CRS \u2265 3(2) 11/38 (28.9) 1/34 (2.9) 26.0 0.0031 \n\nN24CRS \u2265 2(2) 22/38 (57.9) 7/34 (20.6) 37.3 0.0014 \n\nNighttime sleep on 25% most symptomatic \n\nnights (minutes)(3) \n56.80 17.08 39.71 0.0055 \n\nDaytime sleep time on 25% most \n\nsymptomatic days (minutes)(3),(4) \n-46.48 -17.87 -28.61 0.0050 \n\n> 45 min improvement in both nighttime \n\nand daytime sleep (%)(5) \n31.6 8.8 22.8 0.0177 \n\nTiming of sleep (minutes)(1),(3) 35.00 14.48 20.52 0.0123 \n\nRESET Study  \n\nNighttime sleep on 25% most symptomatic \n\nnights (minutes)(3) \n-6.74 -73.74 67.00 0.0233 \n\nDaytime sleep time on 25% most \n\nsymptomatic days (minutes)(3),(4) \n-9.31 49.95 -59.25 0.0266 \n\nTiming of sleep (minutes)(1),(3) 19.99 -16.05 36.04 0.0108 \n(1) Higher numbers indicates improvement \n(2) Sensitivity Analysis \n(3) P-value was based on analysis of covariance model, units are LS mean minutes \n(4) Lower numbers indicates improvement \n(5) Post-hoc analysis \n\n \n\nResponse in Clinical Global Functioning Measures \n\nPatients treated with tasimelteon experienced an overall improvement in clinical global functioning (CGI-\n\nC = 2.6) as compared to patients treated with placebo who showed no improvement status (CGI-C = 3.4) \n\ncompared to the severity of Non-24 at baseline (LS mean difference = -0.8; p=0.0093) (Table 4). The \n\neffectiveness of tasimelteon to improve clinical global functioning was evaluated in SET.  The Clinical \n\nGlobal Impression of Change (CGI-C) is a reflection of the general social, occupational, and health \n\nfunctioning of the patient and is evaluated on a 7-point scale, centered at No Change (4), that investigators \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nused to rate the patients\u2019 improvement from baseline in symptoms of global functioning. It was rated as:       \n\n1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally \n\nworse; 6 = much worse; or 7 = very much worse.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4: Clinical Global Functioning in Non-24 Patients \n\n Tasimelteon 20 mg Placebo p-value \n\nCGI-C (LS mean) 2.6 3.4 0.0093 \n\n \n\n \n\nSee section 4.8 for safety information. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with HETLIOZ \n\nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population who are totally blind with Non-24. See section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon is linear over doses ranging from 3 to 300 mg (0.15 to 15 times the \n\nrecommended daily dosage). The pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon and its metabolites did not change with \n\nrepeated daily dosing. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe peak concentration (Tmax) of tasimelteon occurred approximately 0.5 hours after fasted oral \n\nadministration. The mean absolute oral bioavailability of tasimelteon is 38%. \n\n \n\nWhen administered with a high-fat meal, the Cmax of tasimelteon was 44% lower than when administered in a \n\nfasted state, and the median Tmax was delayed by approximately 1.75 hours. Therefore, tasimelteon should be \n\ntaken without food; if patients eat a high-fat meal, it is recommended to wait at least 2 hours before taking \n\ntasimelteon. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe apparent oral volume of distribution at steady state of tasimelteon in young healthy subjects is \n\napproximately 59 - 126 L. At therapeutic concentrations, tasimelteon is about 88.6 \u2013 90.1% bound to \n\nproteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nTasimelteon is extensively metabolised. Metabolism of tasimelteon consists primarily of oxidation at \n\nmultiple sites and oxidative dealkylation resulting in opening of the dihydrofuran ring followed by further \n\noxidation to give a carboxylic acid. CYP1A2 (35.4%) and CYP3A4 (24.3%) are the major enzymes \n\nidentified to play a role in the metabolism of tasimelteon.  CYP2C9 (18.8%) and CYP2C19 (15.1%) also \n\ncontribute to the metabolism of tasimelteon. Tasimelteon clearance does not appear to be affected by \n\npolymorphisms in these enzymes. \n\nPhenolic glucuronidation is the major phase II metabolic route. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nMajor metabolites had 13-fold or less activity at melatonin receptors compared to tasimelteon. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of radiolabeled tasimelteon, 80% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine \n\nand approximately 4% in faeces, resulting in a mean recovery of 84%. Less than 1% of the dose was \n\nexcreted in urine as the parent compound. \n\n \n\nThe observed mean elimination half-life for tasimelteon is 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 hours. The mean terminal elimination \n\nhalf-life \u00b1 standard deviation of the main metabolites ranges from 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 to 3.7 \u00b1 2.2. \n\n \n\nRepeated once daily dosing with tasimelteon does not result in changes in pharmacokinetic parameters or \n\nsignificant accumulation of tasimelteon. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn elderly subjects, tasimelteon exposure increased by approximately two-fold compared to non-elderly \n\nadults.  Due to the overall inter-subject variability of tasimelteon, this increase is not clinically meaningful \n\nand dose adjustment is not recommended. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThe mean overall exposure of tasimelteon was approximately 1.6-fold greater in female than in male \n\nsubjects.  Due to the overall inter-subject variability of tasimelteon, this increase is not clinically meaningful \n\nand dose adjustment is not recommended. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nRace does not affect apparent clearance of tasimelteon. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of a 20 mg dose of tasimelteon was compared among 8 subjects with mild \n\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score \u22655 and \u22646 points), 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Score \u22657 and \u22649 points), and 13 healthy matched controls. Tasimelteon exposure was increased \n\nless than two-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed in \n\npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Tasimelteon has not been studied in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore caution is recommended when prescribing HETLIOZ to \n\npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of a 20 mg dose of tasimelteon was compared among 8 subjects with severe \n\nrenal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u2264 29 mL/min/1.73m2), 8 subjects with end-\n\nstage renal disease (ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2) requiring hemodialysis, and 16 healthy matched \n\ncontrols. There was no apparent relationship between tasimelteon CL/F and renal function, as measured by \n\neither estimated creatinine clearance or eGFR. Subjects with severe renal impairment had a 30% lower CL/F \n\nclearance than match controls; however, when variability is taken into account, the different was not \n\nsignificant. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nSmokers (smoking is a moderate CYP1A2 inducer) \n\nTasimelteon exposure decreased by approximately 40% in smokers, compared to non-smokers (see section \n\n4.5).  The patient should be instructed to cease or reduce smoking while taking tasimelteon. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and \n\ndevelopment. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \n\nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology  \n\n \n\nIn pregnant rats administered tasimelteon during the period of organogenesis, there were no effects on \n\nembryofoetal development. In pregnant rabbits administered tasimelteon during the period of organogenesis, \n\nembryolethality and embryofoetal toxicity (reduced foetal body weight and delayed ossification) were \n\nobserved at the highest dose tested (200 mg/kg/day).  \n\n \n\nOral administration of tasimelteon  to rats throughout organogenesis and lactation resulted in persistent \n\nreductions in body weight, delayed sexual maturation and physical development,  neurobehavioural \n\nimpairment in offspring at the highest dose tested, andreduced body weight in offspring at the mid-dose \n\ntested. The no effect dose (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 25 times the RHD on a mg/m2 basis. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis \n\n \n\nNo evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice; the highest dose tested is approximately 75 \n\ntimes the RHD of 20 mg/day, on a mg/m2 basis. In rats, the incidence of liver tumours was increased in \n\nmales (adenoma and carcinoma) and females (adenoma) at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day; the incidence of tumours \n\nof the uterus (endometrial adenocarcinoma) and uterus and cervix (squamous cell carcinoma) were increased \n\nat 250 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in tumours at the lowest dose tested in rats, which is approximately \n\n10 times the recommended human doseon a mg/m2 basis. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nHETLIOZ 20 mg hard capsules \n\ntasimelteon \n\n \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1. What HETLIOZ is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take HETLIOZ  \n\n3. How to take HETLIOZ  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store HETLIOZ \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What HETLIOZ is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ contains the active substance tasimelteon.  This type of medicine is called a \u201cmelatonin agonist\u201d \n\nthat acts as a regulator of daily body rhythms. \n\n \n\nIt is used to treat Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) in adults who are totally blind. \n\n \n\nHow HETLIOZ works \n\nIn sighted people, the change in light levels between day and night helps to synchronise internal body \n\nrhythms, including feeling sleepy at night and being active during the day. The body controls these rhythms \n\nthrough many pathways including increases and decreases in the production of the hormone melatonin.  \n\n \n\nPatients with Non-24 who are totally blind cannot see light, so their body rhythms shift out of alignment with \n\nthe 24-hour world, resulting in periods of feeling sleepy during the day and the inability to sleep at night. The \n\nactive substance in HETLIOZ, tasimelteon, is able to act as a time-keeper for the body rhythms and resets \n\nthem each day.  It aligns body rhythms with the usual 24-hour day and night cycle and so improve sleep \n\npatterns. Because of individual differences in each person\u2019s body rhythms, it could take weeks or up to 3 \n\nmonths for an improvement in symptoms to be noticed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take HETLIOZ  \n \n\nDo not take HETLIOZ if \nYou are allergic to tasimelteon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n  \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nAfter taking HETLIOZ, you should get ready to go to bed and only carry out activities that you would \n\nnormally do before going to bed. \n\n \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nDo not give HETLIOZ to children under the age of 18 years.  This is because HETLIOZ has not been tested \n\nin people under 18 years of age and the effects are unknown.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and HETLIOZ \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  This \n\nincludes:  \n\n- medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called \u2018CYP1A2\u2019.  An example is \nfluvoxamine, which is used to treat depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).   \n\n- medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called \u2018CYP3A4\u2019.  An example is \nketoconazole, which is used to treat fungal infections. \n\n- medicines known to increase the activity of an enzyme called \u2018CYP3A4\u2019.  An example is rifampicin, \nwhich is used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n\n- medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called \u2018CYP2C19\u2019.  An example is \nomeprazole, which is used to treat hearburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \n\n- medicines called \u201cbeta blockers\u201d used to treat high blood pressure and other heart problems.  Some \nexamples include atenolol, metoprolol, and propanolol. \n\n \n\nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \n\nHETLIOZ. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to \n\navoid the use of tasimelteon during pregnancy.  If you become pregnant while taking HETLIOZ, consult \n\nyour doctor immediately as it is recommended not to take HETLIOZ while you are pregnant or breast \n\nfeeding. \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before \n\ntaking this medicine. \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ contains Orange Yellow S (E110) \n\nTell your doctor if you have an allergy to Orange Yellow S (E110).  HETLIOZ contains Orange Yellow S \n\n(E110) which may cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nHETLIOZ contains sodium  \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take HETLIOZ \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much to take \n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule every night, taken one hour before you go to bed. Try to take the \n\nmedicine at the same time every night.  Because of individual differences in each person\u2019s body rhythms, it \n\ncould take weeks or months for you to notice an improvement in your symptoms.  Therefore, your doctor \n\nmay ask you to take HETLIOZ for up to 3 months before checking if it is working for you. \n\n \n\nTaking HETLIOZ \n\n- Take the medicine by mouth. \n- Swallow the capsule whole.  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n- It is best to take HETLIOZ on an empty stomach as food can reduce the amount of the medicine that \nis absorbed into your body.  If you eat a high-fat meal close to the time you would normally take the \n\nmedicine, it is best to wait 2 hours before taking HETLIOZ.  \n\n- To open the bottle, push the cap down and turn counter-clockwise. \n \n\nIf you take more HETLIOZ than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take more HETLIOZ than your doctor recommended, contact your doctor at once or \n\ncontact the nearest hospital for advice. Keep the bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you \n\nhave taken. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take HETLIOZ \n- Skip the missed dose.  Take your next dose at the usual time the next day. Do not take a double dose. \n\n  \n\nIf you stop taking HETLIOZ \n\nDo not stop taking HETLIOZ without talking to your doctor. \n\n- If HETLIOZ is not taken every night, the body rhythms will lose alignment with the usual 24-hour \nday and night cycle again.  This means that  symptoms will come back. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n4.

\"melatonin agonist\" that acts as a regulator of daily body rhythms. it is used to treat non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (non-24) in adults who are totally blind. how hetlioz works in sighted people, the change in light levels between day and night helps to synchronise internal body rhythms, including feeling sleepy at night and being active during the day. the body controls these rhythms through many pathways including increases and decreases in the production of the hormone melatonin. patients with non-24 who are totally blind cannot see light, so their body rhythms shift out of alignment with the 24-hour world, resulting in periods of feeling sleepy during the day and the inability to sleep at night. the active substance in hetlioz, tasimelteon, is able to act as a time-keeper for the body rhythms and resets them each day. it aligns body rhythms with the usual 24-hour day and night cycle and so improve sleep patterns. because of individual differences in each person's body rhythms, it could take weeks or up to 3 months for an improvement in symptoms to be noticed.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "hetlioz", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 0,

can reduce the amount of the medicine that is absorbed into your body. if you eat a high-fat meal close to the time you would normally take the medicine, it is best to wait 2 hours before taking hetlioz. - to open the bottle, push the cap down and turn counter-clockwise. if you take more hetlioz than you should if you accidentally take more hetlioz than your doctor recommended, contact your doctor at once or contact the nearest hospital for advice. keep the bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take hetlioz - skip the missed dose. take your next dose at the usual time the next day. do not take a double dose. if you stop taking hetlioz do not stop taking hetlioz without talking to your doctor. - if hetlioz is not taken every night, the
