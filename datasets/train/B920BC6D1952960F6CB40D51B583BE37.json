CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men. Erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or \nmaintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. \n \nIn order for Vivanza to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nUse in adult men \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg taken as needed approximately 25 to 60 minutes before sexual activity. \nBased on efficacy and tolerability the dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg. The \nmaximum recommended dose is 20 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. \nVivanza can be taken with or without food. The onset of activity may be delayed if taken with a high fat \nmeal (see section 5.2). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly (>65 years old) \nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. However, an increase to a maximum 20 mg dose \nshould be carefully considered depending on the individual tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA starting dose of 5 mg should be considered in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A-B). Based on tolerability and efficacy, the dose may subsequently be increased. The \n\n\n\n3 \n\nmaximum dose recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 10 mg \n(see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), a starting dose of 5 mg \nshould be considered. Based on tolerability and efficacy the dose may be increased to 10 mg and 20 mg. \n \nPaediatric population  \nVivanza is not indicated for individuals below 18 years of age. There is no relevant indication for use of \nVivanza in children. \n \nUse in patients using other medicinal products \nConcomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors \nWhen used in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin or clarithromycin, the \ndose of vardenafil should not exceed 5 mg (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nThe co-administration of vardenafil with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form \nis contraindicated (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nVivanza is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic \nanterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or \nnot with previous phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction should generally not be used in men for \nwhom sexual activity is inadvisable (e.g. patients with severe cardiovascular disorders such as unstable \nangina or severe cardiac failure [New York Heart Association III or IV]). \n \nThe safety of vardenafil has not been studied in the following sub-groups of patients and its use is \ntherefore contraindicated until further information is available: \n- severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), \n- end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, \n- hypotension (blood pressure <90/50 mmHg), \n- recent history of stroke or myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months), \n- unstable angina and known hereditary retinal degenerative disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. \n \nConcomitant use of vardenafil with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and itraconazole (oral \nform) is contraindicated in men older than 75 years. \n \nConcomitant use of vardenafil with HIV protease inhibitors such as ritonavir and indinavir is \ncontraindicated, as they are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, \nsuch as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section \n4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nA medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and \ndetermine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nPrior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular \nstatus of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity (see section \n4.3). Vardenafil has vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure \n(see section 5.1). Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, e.g. aortic stenosis and idiopathic \nhypertrophic subaortic stenosis, can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators including Type 5 \nphosphodiesterase inhibitors. \n \nSerious cardiovascular events including sudden death, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, ventricular \ntachy-arrythmia, angina pectoris, and cerebrovascular disorders (including transient ischaemic attack \nand cerebral haemorrhage), have been reported in temporal association with vardenafil. Most of the \npatients in whom these events have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, \nit is not possible to definitively determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, \nto vardenafil, to sexual activity, or to a combination of these or other factors. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction should be used with caution in patients with \nanatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie\u2019s disease), or in \npatients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, \nmultiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of Vivanza film-coated tablets with Vivanza orodispersible \ntablets or other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such \ncombinations is not recommended. \n \nTolerability of the maximum dose of 20 mg may be lower in elderly patients (\u226565 years old) (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nConcomitant use of alpha-blockers \nThe concomitant use of alpha-blockers and vardenafil may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some \npatients because both are vasodilators. Concomitant treatment with vardenafil should only be initiated if \nthe patient has been stabilised on his alpha-blocker therapy. In those patients who are stable on \nalpha-blocker therapy, vardenafil should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose of 5 mg \nfilm-coated tablets. Vardenafil may be administered at any time with tamsulosin or with alfuzosin. With \nother alpha-blockers a time separation of dosing should be considered when vardenafil is prescribed \nconcomitantly (see section 4.5). In those patients already taking an optimized dose of vardenafil, \nalpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose \nmay be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking vardenafil. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of vardenafil with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole and ketoconazole \n(oral form) should be avoided as very high plasma concentrations of vardenafil are reached if the \nmedicinal products are combined (see sections 4.5 and 4.3). \n \nVardenafil dose adjustment might be necessary if moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin \nand clarithromycin, are given concomitantly (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). \n \nConcomitant intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of \nvardenafil. The combination should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nEffect on QTc interval \nSingle oral doses of 10 mg and 80 mg of vardenafil have been shown to prolong the QTc interval by a \nmean of 8 msec and 10 msec, respectively. And single doses of 10 mg vardenafil co-administered \nconcomitantly with 400 mg gatifloxacin, an active substance with comparable QT effect, showed an \nadditive QTc effect of 4 msec when compared to either active substance alone. The clinical impact of \nthese QT changes is unknown (see section 5.1). \nThe clinical relevance of this finding is unknown and cannot be generalised to all patients under all \ncircumstances, as it will depend on the individual risk factors and susceptibilities that may be present at \n\n\n\n5 \n\nany time in any given patient. Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval, including vardenafil, \nare best avoided in patients with relevant risk factors, for example, hypokalaemia, congenital QT \nprolongation, concomitant administration of antiarrhythmic medicinal products in Class 1A (e.g. \nquinidine, procainamide), or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol). \n \nEffect on vision \nVisual defects and cases of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have been reported in \nconnection with the intake of Vivanza and other PDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data \nsuggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with erectile dysfunction following exposure to PDE5 \ninhibitors such as vardenafil, tadalafil and sildenafil (see section 4.8). As this may be relevant for all \npatients exposed to vardenafil the patient should be advised that in the case of sudden visual defect, he \nshould stop taking Vivanza and consult immediately a physician (see section 4.3). \n \nEffect on bleeding \nIn vitro studies with human platelets indicate that vardenafil has no antiaggregatory effect on its own, \nbut at high (super-therapeutic) concentrations, vardenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of the \nnitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside. In humans vardenafil had no effect on bleeding time alone or in \ncombination with acetylsalicyclic acid (see section 4.5). There is no safety information available on the \nadministration of vardenafil to patients with bleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration. Therefore \nvardenafil should be administered to these patients only after careful benefit-risk assessment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on vardenafil \nIn vitro studies \nVardenafil is metabolised predominantly by hepatic enzymes via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 3A4, \nwith some contribution from CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes \nmay reduce vardenafil clearance. \n \nIn vivo studies \nCo-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir (800 mg three times a day), a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, with vardenafil (10 mg film-coated tablets) resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC \nand a 7-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax. At 24 hours, the plasma levels of vardenafil had fallen to \napproximately 4% of the maximum vardenafil plasma level (Cmax). \n \nCo-administration of vardenafil with ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) resulted in a 13-fold increase in \nvardenafil Cmax and a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC0-24 when co-administered with vardenafil \n5 mg. The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of vardenafil by ritonavir, a \nhighly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9. Ritonavir significantly prolonged the \nhalf-life of vardenafil to 25.7 hours (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, with vardenafil (5 mg) \nresulted in a 10-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 4-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax (see section \n4.4). \n \nAlthough specific interaction studies have not been conducted, the concomitant use of other potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (such as itraconazole) can be expected to produce vardenafil plasma levels \ncomparable to those produced by ketoconazole. Concomitant use of vardenafil with potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors such as itraconazole and ketoconazole (oral use) should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nIn men older than 75 years the concomitant use of vardenafil with itraconazole or ketoconazole is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, with vardenafil \n(5 mg) resulted in a 4-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 3-fold increase in Cmax. Although a specific \ninteraction study has not been conducted, the co-administration of clarithromycin can be expected to \nresult in similar effects on vardenafil AUC and Cmax. When used in combination with a moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitor such as erythromycin or clarithromycin, vardenafil dose adjustment might be \n\n\n\n6 \n\nnecessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Cimetidine (400 mg twice daily), a non-specific cytochrome P450 \ninhibitor, had no effect on vardenafil AUC and Cmax when co-administered with vardenafil (20 mg) to \nhealthy volunteers. \n \nGrapefruit juice being a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 gut wall metabolism, may give rise to modest \nincreases in plasma levels of vardenafil (see section 4.4). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of vardenafil (20 mg) was not affected by co-administration with the \nH2-antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), digoxin, warfarin, glibenclamide, alcohol (mean \nmaximum blood alcohol level of 73 mg/dl) or single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminium \nhydroxide). \n \nAlthough specific interaction studies were not conducted for all medicinal products, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect on vardenafil pharmacokinetics of the following \nconcomitant medicinal products: acetylsalicylic acid, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, weak CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, diuretics and medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes (sulfonylureas and metformin). \n \nEffects of vardenafil on other medicinal products \nThere are no data on the interaction of vardenafil and non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as \ntheophylline or dipyridamole. \n \nIn vivo studies \nNo potentiation of the blood pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) was observed \nwhen vardenafil (10 mg) was given at varying time intervals (1 h to 24 h) prior to the dose of \nnitroglycerin in a study in 18 healthy male subjects. Vardenafil 20 mg film-coated tablets potentiated the \nblood pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil \nadministration to healthy middle aged subjects. No effect on blood pressure was observed when \nnitroglycerin was taken 24 hours after administration of a single dose of vardenafil 20 mg film-coated \ntablets. However, there is no information on the possible potentiation of the hypotensive effects of \nnitrates by vardenafil in patients, and concomitant use is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nNicorandil is a hybrid of potassium channel opener and nitrate. Due to the nitrate component, it has the \npotential to have serious interaction with vardenafil. \n \nSince alpha-blocker monotherapy can cause marked lowering of blood pressure, especially postural \nhypotension and syncope, interaction studies were conducted with vardenafil. In two interaction studies \nwith healthy normotensive volunteers after forced titration of the alpha-blockers tamsulosin or terazosin \nto high doses, hypotension (in some cases symptomatic) was reported in a significant number of subjects \nafter co-administration of vardenafil. Among subjects treated with terazosin, hypotension was observed \nmore frequently when vardenafil and terazosin were given simultaneously than when the dosing was \nseparated by a time interval of 6 hours. \n \nBased on the results of interaction studies conducted with vardenafil in patients with benign prostatic \nhyperplasia (BPH) on stable tamsulosin, terazosin or alfuzosin therapy: \n \n\u2022 When vardenafil (film-coated tablets) was given at doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg on a background of \n\nstable therapy with tamsulosin, there was no symptomatic reduction in blood pressure, although \n3/21 tamsulosin treated subjects exhibited transient standing systolic blood pressures of less than \n85 mmHg. \n\n\u2022 When vardenafil 5 mg (film-coated tablets) was given simultaneously with terazosin 5 or 10 mg, \none of 21 patients experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. Hypotension was not observed \nwhen vardenafil 5 mg and terazosin administration was separated by 6 hours. \n\n\u2022 When vardenafil (film-coated tablets) was given at doses of 5 or 10 mg on a background of stable \ntherapy with alfuzosin, compared to placebo, there was no symptomatic reduction in blood \npressure.   \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTherefore, concomitant treatment should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha-blocker \ntherapy. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, vardenafil should be initiated at the \nlowest recommended starting dose of 5 mg. Vivanza may be administered at any time with tamsulosin \nor alfuzosin. With other alpha-blockers a time separation of dosing should be considered when \nvardenafil is prescribed concomitantly (see section 4.4). \n \nNo significant interactions were shown when warfarin (25 mg), which is metabolised by CYP2C9, or \ndigoxin (0.375 mg) was co-administered with vardenafil (20 mg film-coated tablets).  \nThe relative bioavailability of glibenclamide (3.5 mg) was not affected when co-administered with \nvardenafil (20 mg). In a specific study, where vardenafil (20 mg) was co-administered with slow release \nnifedipine (30 mg or 60 mg) in hypertensive patients, there was an additional reduction on supine \nsystolic blood pressure of 6 mmHg and supine diastolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg accompanied with \nan increase in heart rate of 4 bpm. \n \nWhen vardenafil (20 mg film-coated tablets) and alcohol (mean maximum blood alcohol level of \n73 mg/dl) were taken together, vardenafil did not potentiate the effects of alcohol on blood pressure and \nheart rate and the pharmacokinetics of vardenafil were not altered. \n \nVardenafil (10 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetylsalicylic acid \n(2 x 81 mg). \n \nRiociguat \nPreclinical studies showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were \ncombined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive \neffects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the \npopulation studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nVivanza is not indicated for use by women. There are no studies of vardenafil in pregnant women.  \nThere are no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nAs dizziness and abnormal vision have been reported in clinical trials with vardenafil, patients should be \naware of how they react to Vivanza, before driving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reactions reported with Vivanza film-coated tablets or 10 mg orodispersible tablets in \nclinical trials were generally transient and mild to moderate in nature. The most commonly reported \nadverse drug reaction occurring in \u2265 10% of patients is headache. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the MedDRA frequency convention: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and not \nknown (can not be estimated from available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported: \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 \nto <1/1,000) \n\nNot known \n(cannot be \nestimated from \nthe available \ndata) \n\nInfection and \ninfestations \n\n   Conjunctivitis  \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Allergic oedema \nand angioedema \n\nAllergic reaction  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  Sleep disorder Anxiety  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness Somnolence \nParaesthesia and \ndysaesthesia \n\nSyncope \nSeizure  \nAmnesia \nTransient \nischaemic attack \n\nCerebral \nhaemorrhage \n\nEye disorders    Visual \ndisturbance  \nOcular \nhyperaemia \nVisual colour \ndistortions \nEye pain and eye \ndiscomfort \nPhotophobia  \n\nIncrease in \nintraocular \npressure \nLacrimation \nincreased \n\nNon-arteritic \nanterior \nischemic optic \nneuropathy \nVisual defects \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Tinnitus  \nVertigo \n\n Sudden \ndeafness \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Palpitation \nTachycardia \n\nMyocardial \ninfarction \nVentricular \ntachy-arrhyth-\nmias \nAngina pectoris \n\nSudden death \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Flushing  Hypotension \nHypertension \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Nasal \ncongestion \n\nDyspnoea \nSinus congestion \n\nEpistaxis   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 \nto <1/1,000) \n\nNot known \n(cannot be \nestimated from \nthe available \ndata) \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\n Dyspepsia Gastro-oesopha-\ngeal reflux \ndisease \nGastritis \nGastrointestinal \nand abdominal \npain \nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea \nDry mouth \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Increase in \ntransaminases \n\nIncrease in \ngamma-glutamyl \ntransferase \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Erythema \nRash \n\nPhotosensitivity \nreaction \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders  \n\n  Back pain \nIncrease in \ncreatine \nphosphokinase \nMyalgia \nIncreased muscle \ntone and \ncramping \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    Haematuria \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders  \n\n  Increase in \nerection \n\nPriapism Penile \nHaemorrhage \nHaemato-\nspermia \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n  Feeling unwell Chest pain  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPenile haemorrhage, haematospermia and haematuria have been reported in clinical trials and \nspontaneous post-marketing data with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. \n \nAt a dose of 20 mg Vivanza film-coated tablets, elderly (\u226565 years old) patients had higher frequencies \nof headaches (16.2% versus 11.8%) and dizziness (3.7% versus 0.7%) than younger patients (<65 years \nold). In general, the incidence of adverse reactions (especially \u201cdizziness\u201d) has been shown to be slightly \nhigher in patients with a history of hypertension. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn single dose volunteer studies, doses up to and including 80 mg vardenafil (film-coated tablets) per \nday were tolerated without exhibiting serious adverse reactions. \n \nWhen vardenafil was administered in higher doses and more frequently than the recommended dose \nregimen (40 mg film-coated tablets twice daily) cases of severe back pain have been reported. This was \nnot associated with any muscle or neurological toxicity. \n \nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not \nexpected to accelerate clearance, as vardenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not significantly \neliminated in the urine. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC code: G04BE09. \n \nVardenafil is an oral therapy for the improvement of erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction. \nIn the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation it restores impaired erectile function by increasing \nblood flow to the penis. \n \nPenile erection is a haemodynamic process. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released. It \nactivates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increased level of cyclic guanosine \nmonophosphate (cGMP) in the corpus cavernosum. This in turn results in smooth muscle relaxation, \nallowing increased inflow of blood into the penis. The level of cGMP is regulated by the rate of \nsynthesis via guanylate cyclase and by the rate of degradation via cGMP hydrolysing \nphosphodiesterases (PDEs). \n \nVardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the \nmost prominent PDE in the human corpus cavernosum. Vardenafil potently enhances the effect of \nendogenous nitric oxide in the corpus cavernosum by inhibiting PDE5. When nitric oxide is released in \nresponse to sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum \nlevels of cGMP. Sexual stimulation is therefore required for vardenafil to produce its beneficial \ntherapeutic effects. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that vardenafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other known \nphosphodiesterases (>15-fold relative to PDE6, >130-fold relative to PDE1, >300-fold relative to \nPDE11, and >1000-fold relative to PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9 and PDE10). \n \nIn a penile plesthysmography (RigiScan) study, vardenafil 20 mg produced erections considered \nsufficient for penetration (60% rigidity by RigiScan) in some men as early as 15 minutes after dosing. \nThe overall response of these subjects to vardenafil became statistically significant, compared to \nplacebo, 25 minutes after dosing. \n \nVardenafil causes mild and transient decreases in blood pressure, which in the majority of the cases, do \nnot translate into clinical effects. The mean maximum decreases in supine systolic blood pressure \nfollowing 20 mg and 40 mg vardenafil were \u2013 6.9 mmHg under 20 mg and \u2013 4.3 mmHg under 40 mg of \nvardenafil, when compared to placebo. These effects are consistent with the vasodilatory effects of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nPDE5-inhibitors and are probably due to increased cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells. Single \nand multiple oral doses of vardenafil up to 40 mg produced no clinically relevant changes in the ECGs \nof normal male volunteers. \n \nA single dose, double blind, crossover, randomised trial in 59 healthy males compared the effects on the \nQT interval of vardenafil (10 mg and 80 mg), sildenafil (50 mg and 400 mg) and placebo. Moxifloxacin \n(400 mg) was included as an active internal control. Effects on the QT interval were measured one hour \npost-dose (average tmax for vardenafil). The primary objective of this study was to rule out a greater than \n10 msec effect (i.e. to demonstrate lack of effect) of a single 80 mg oral dose of vardenafil on QTc \ninterval compared to placebo, as measured by the change in Fridericia's correction formula \n(QTcF=QT/RR1/3) from baseline at the 1 hour post-dose time point. The vardenafil results showed an \nincrease in QTc (Fridericia) of 8 msec (90% CI: 6-9) and 10 msec (90% CI: 8-11) at 10 and 80 mg doses \ncompared to placebo and an increase in QTci of 4 msec (90% CI: 3-6) and 6 msec (90% CI: 4-7) at 10 \nand 80 mg doses compared to placebo, at one hour post-dose. At tmax, only the mean change in QTcF for \nvardenafil 80 mg was out of the study established limit (mean 10 msec, 90% CI: 8-11). When using the \nindividual correction formulae, none of the values were out of the limit. \n \nIn a separate post-marketing study of 44 healthy volunteers, single doses of 10 mg vardenafil or 50 mg \nsildenafil were co-administered concomitantly with 400 mg gatifloxacin, a drug with comparable QT \neffect. Both vardenafil and sildenafil showed an increase of Fridericia QTc effect of 4 msec (vardenafil) \nand 5 msec (sildenafil) when compared to either drug alone. The actual clinical impact of these QT \nchanges is unknown. \n \nFurther information on clinical trials with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets \nEfficacy and safety of vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets were separately demonstrated in a broad \npopulation in two studies including 701 randomized erectile dysfunction patients who were treated up to \n12 weeks. The distribution of patients in the predefined subgroups was covering elderly patients (51%), \npatients with history of diabetes mellitus (29%), dyslipidemia (39%) and hypertension (40%).   \n \nIn pooled data from the two vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets trials, IIEF-EF domain scores were \nsignificantly higher with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablet versus placebo. \n \nA percentage of 71% of all sexual attempts reported in the clinical trials had successful penetration \ncompared to 44% of all attempts in the placebo group. These results were also reflected in subgroups, in \nelderly patients (65%), in patients with history of diabetes mellitus (63%), patients with history of \ndyslipidemia (66%) and hypertension (70%) of all sexual attempts reported had successful penetration. \n \nAbout 63% of all reported sexual attempts with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets were successful \nin terms of erection maintenance compared to about 26% of all placebo-controlled sexual attempts. In \nthe predefined subgroups 57% (elderly patients), 56% (patients with history of diabetes mellitus), 59% \n(patients with history of dyslipidemia) and 60% (patients with history of hypertension) of all reported \nattempts with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets were successful in terms of maintenance of \nerection. \n \nFurther information on clinical trials \nIn clinical trials vardenafil was administered to over 17,000 men with erectile dysfunction (ED) aged \n18 - 89 years, many of whom had multiple co-morbid conditions. Over 2,500 patients have been treated \nwith vardenafil for six months or longer. Of these, 900 patients have been treated for one year or longer. \n \nThe following patient groups were represented: elderly (22%), patients with hypertension (35%), \ndiabetes mellitus (29%), ischaemic heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases (7%), chronic \npulmonary disease (5%), hyperlipidaemia (22%), depression (5%), radical prostatectomy (9%). The \nfollowing groups were not well represented in clinical trials: elderly (>75 years, 2.4%), and patients with \ncertain cardiovascular conditions (see section 4.3). No clinical trials in CNS diseases (except spinal cord \ninjury), patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, pelvic surgery (except nerve-sparing \nprostatectomy) or trauma or radiotherapy and hypoactive sexual desire or penile anatomic deformities \nhave been performed. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nAcross the pivotal trials, treatment with vardenafil (film-coated tablets) resulted in an improvement of \nerectile function compared to placebo. In the small number of patients who attempted intercourse up to \nfour to five hours after dosing the success rate for penetration and maintenance of erection was \nconsistently greater than placebo. \n \nIn fixed dose studies (film-coated tablets) in a broad population of men with erectile dysfunction, 68% \n(5 mg), 76% (10 mg) and 80% (20 mg) of patients experienced successful penetrations (SEP 2) \ncompared to 49% on placebo over a three month study period. The ability to maintain the erection \n(SEP 3) in this broad ED population was given as 53% (5 mg), 63% (10 mg) and 65% (20 mg) \ncompared to 29% on placebo. \n \nIn pooled data from the major efficacy trials, the proportion of patients experiencing successful \npenetration on vardenafil were as follows: psychogenic erectile dysfunction (77-87%), mixed erectile \ndysfunction (69-83%), organic erectile dysfunction (64-75%), elderly (52-75%), ischaemic heart \ndisease (70-73%), hyperlipidaemia (62-73%), chronic pulmonary disease (74-78%), depression \n(59-69%), and patients concomitantly treated with antihypertensives (62-73%). \n \nIn a clinical trial in patients with diabetes mellitus, vardenafil significantly improved the erectile \nfunction domain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful \nintercourse and penile rigidity compared to placebo at vardenafil doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. The \nresponse rates for the ability to obtain and maintain an erection was 61% and 49% on 10 mg and 64% \nand 54% on 20 mg vardenafil compared to 36% and 23% on placebo for patients who completed three \nmonths treatment. \n \nIn a clinical trial in post-prostatectomy patients, vardenafil significantly improved the erectile function \ndomain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse and \npenile rigidity compared to placebo at vardenafil doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. The response rates for the \nability to obtain and maintain an erection was 47% and 37% on 10 mg and 48% and 34% on 20 mg \nvardenafil compared to 22% and 10% on placebo for patients who completed three months treatment. \n \nIn a flexible-dose clinical trial in patients with Spinal Cord Injury, vardenafil significantly improved the \nerectile function domain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful \nintercourse and penile rigidity compared to placebo. The number of patients who returned to a normal \nIIEF domain score (>26) were 53% on vardenafil compared to 9% on placebo. The response rates for the \nability to obtain and maintain an erection were 76% and 59% on vardenafil compared to 41% and 22% \non placebo for patients who completed three months treatment which were clinically and statistically \nsignificant (p<0.001). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of vardenafil was maintained in long-term studies. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets \nof the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBioequivalence studies have shown that vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablet is not bioequivalent to \nvardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets. Therefore the orodispersible formulation should not be used as an \nequivalent to vardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets.  \n \nAbsorption \nIn vardenafil film-coated tablets, vardenafil is rapidly absorbed with maximum observed plasma \nconcentrations reached in some men as early as 15 minutes after oral administration. However, 90% of \nthe time, maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of \noral dosing in the fasted state. The mean absolute oral bioavailability is 15%. After oral dosing of \n\n\n\n13 \n\nvardenafil AUC and Cmax increase almost dose proportionally over the recommended dose range \n(5 \u2013 20 mg). \n \nWhen vardenafil film-coated tablets are taken with a high fat meal (containing 57% fat), the rate of \nabsorption is reduced, with an increase in the median tmax of 1 hour and a mean reduction in Cmax of 20%. \nVardenafil AUC is not affected. After a meal containing 30% fat, the rate and extent of absorption of \nvardenafil (tmax, Cmax and AUC) are unchanged compared to administration under fasting conditions. \n \nVardenafil is rapidly absorbed after administration of Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets without \nwater. The median time to reach Cmax varied between 45 to 90 minutes and was similar or slightly \ndelayed (by 8 to 45 min) compared to the film-coated tablets. Mean vardenafil AUC was increased by \n21 to 29% (middle aged and elderly ED patients) or 44% (young healthy subjects) with 10 mg \norodispersible tablets compared to film-coated tablets as a result of local oral absorption of a small \namount of drug in the oral cavity. There was no consistent difference in mean Cmax between \norodispersible tablets and film-coated tablets. \n \nIn subjects taking vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets with a high fat meal no effect on vardenafil \nAUC and tmax was observed, while vardenafil Cmax was reduced by 35% in the fed condition. Based on \nthese results vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets are taken with water, the AUC is reduced by 29%, Cmax \nremains unchanged and median tmax is shortened by 60 minutes compared to intake without water. \nVardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets must be taken without liquid. \n \nDistribution \nThe mean steady state volume of distribution for vardenafil is 208 l, indicating distribution into the \ntissues.  \n \nVardenafil and its major circulating metabolite (M1) are highly bound to plasma proteins \n(approximately 95% for vardenafil or M1). For vardenafil as well as M1, protein binding is independent \nof total drug concentrations. \nBased on measurements of vardenafil in semen of healthy subjects 90 minutes after dosing, not more \nthan 0.00012% of the administered dose may appear in the semen of patients. \n \nBiotransformation \nVardenafil in film-coated tablets is metabolised predominantly by hepatic metabolism via cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) isoform 3A4 with some contribution from CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. \n \nIn humans the one major circulating metabolite (M1) results from desethylation of vardenafil and is \nsubject to further metabolism with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 4 hours. Parts of M1 \nare in the form of the glucuronide in systemic circulation. Metabolite M1 shows a phosphodiesterase \nselectivity profile similar to vardenafil and an in vitro potency for phosphodiesterase type 5 of \napproximately 28% compared to vardenafil, resulting in an efficacy contribution of about 7%. \n \nThe mean terminal half-life of vardenafil in patients receiving Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets \nranged between 4 \u2013 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the metabolite M1 is between 3 to 5 hours, \nsimilar to parent drug. \n \nElimination \nThe total body clearance of vardenafil is 56 l/h with a resultant terminal half-life of approximately \n4-5 hours. After oral administration, vardenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the faeces \n(approximately 91-95% of the administered dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately \n2-6% of the administered dose). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \nElderly \nHepatic clearance of vardenafil in healthy elderly volunteers (65 years and over) was reduced as \ncompared to healthy younger volunteers (18 - 45 years). On average elderly males taking vardenafil \nfilm-coated tablets had a 52% higher AUC, and a 34% higher Cmax than younger males (see section 4.2). \n \nVardenafil AUC and Cmax in elderly patients (65 years or over) taking vardenafil orodispersible tablets \nwere increased by 31 to 39% and 16 to 21%, respectively, in comparison to patients aged 45 years and \nbelow. Vardenafil was not found to accumulate in the plasma in patients aged 45 years and below or \n65 years or over following once-daily dosing of vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets over ten days. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn volunteers with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 80 ml/min), the \npharmacokinetics of vardenafil were similar to that of a normal renal function control group. In \nvolunteers with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) the mean AUC was \nincreased by 21% and the mean Cmax decreased by 23%, compared to volunteers with no renal \nimpairment. No statistically significant correlation was observed between creatinine clearance and \nvardenafil exposure (AUC and Cmax) (see section 4.2). Vardenafil pharmacokinetics has not been \nstudied in patients requiring dialysis (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B), the clearance of vardenafil \nwas reduced in proportion to the degree of hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A), the mean AUC and Cmax increased 17% and 22% respectively, compared to healthy \ncontrol subjects. In patients with moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B), the mean AUC and Cmax \nincreased by 160% and 133% respectively, compared to healthy control subjects (see section 4.2). The \npharmacokinetics of vardenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh C) has \nnot been studied (see section 4.3). \n \nAdditional information \nIn vitro data suggest that effects of vardenafil on P-glycoprotein substrates more sensitive than digoxin \ncannot be excluded. Dabigatran etexilate is an example for highly sensitive intestinal P-glycoprotein \nsubstrates. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach orodispersible tablet contains 10 mg of vardenafil (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipients:  \n7.96 mg sorbitol (E420), and 1.80 mg aspartame (E951) per orodispersible tablet. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOrodispersible tablet.  \nWhite round tablets. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS   \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men. Erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or \nmaintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. \n \nIn order for Vivanza to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \nVivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets are not bioequivalent to Vivanza 10 mg film-coated tablets (see \nsection 5.1). The maximum dose for Vivanza orodispersible tablet is 10 mg/day. \n \nUse in adult men \nVivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets are taken as needed approximately 25 to 60 minutes before sexual \nactivity.  \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly (\u226565 years old) \nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. However, an increase to a maximum dose of \nVivanza 20 mg film-coated tablets should be carefully considered depending on the individual \ntolerability (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \nVivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets are not indicated as a starting dose in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh A).  \n \nPatients with mild hepatic impairment should start treatment with Vivanza 5 mg film-coated tablets. \nBased on tolerability and efficacy, the dose may be increased to Vivanza 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated \ntablets, or Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets.  \n \nThe maximum dose recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is \nVivanza 10 mg as film-coated tablets (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nVivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets are not for use in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C; see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) a starting dose of Vivanza \n5 mg film-coated tablets should be considered. Based on tolerability and efficacy, the dose may be \nincreased to Vivanza 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets, or Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets. \nVivanza orodispersible tablet is not for use in patients with end-stage renal failure (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nVivanza orodispersible tablets are not indicated for individuals below 18 years of age. There is no \nrelevant indication for use of Vivanza orodispersible tablets in children and adolescents. \n \nUse in patients using other medicinal products \nConcomitant use of moderate or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors \nVardenafil dose adjustment is necessary if moderate or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors are given \nconcomitantly (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \nThe orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disintegrate, \nand then swallowed. Vivanza orodispersible tablets must be taken without liquid and immediately upon \nrelease from the blister. \nVivanza orodispersible tablets can be taken with or without food.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nThe co-administration of vardenafil with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form \nis contraindicated (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nVivanza is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic \nanterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or \nnot with previous phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction should generally not be used in men for \nwhom sexual activity is inadvisable (e.g. patients with severe cardiovascular disorders such as unstable \nangina or severe cardiac failure [New York Heart Association III or IV]). \n \nThe safety of vardenafil has not been studied in the following sub-groups of patients and its use is \ntherefore contraindicated until further information is available: \n- severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), \n- end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, \n- hypotension (blood pressure <90/50 mmHg), \n- recent history of stroke or myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months), \n- unstable angina, and known hereditary retinal degenerative disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. \n \nConcomitant use of vardenafil with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and itraconazole (oral \nform) is contraindicated in men older than 75 years. \n \nConcomitant use of vardenafil with HIV protease inhibitors such as ritonavir and indinavir is \ncontraindicated, as they are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, \nsuch as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section \n4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nA medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and \ndetermine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. \n \nPrior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular \nstatus of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity (see section \n4.3). Vardenafil has vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure \n(see section 5.1). Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, e.g. aortic stenosis and idiopathic \nhypertrophic subaortic stenosis, can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators including Type 5 \nphosphodiesterase inhibitors. \n  \nSerious cardiovascular events including sudden death, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, ventricular \ntachy-arrythmia, angina pectoris, and cerebrovascular disorders (including transient ischaemic attack \nand cerebral haemorrhage), have been reported in temporal association with vardenafil. Most of the \npatients in whom these events have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, \nit is not possible to definitively determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, \nto vardenafil, to sexual activity, or to a combination of these or other factors. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction should be used with caution in patients with \nanatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie\u2019s disease), or in \npatients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, \nmultiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of Vivanza orodispersible tablets with film-coated tablets or \nother treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore the use of such combinations \nis not recommended. \n \nTolerability of the maximum dose of Vivanza 20 mg film-coated tablets may be lower in elderly patients \n(\u226565 years old) (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nConcomitant use of alpha-blockers \nThe concomitant use of alpha-blockers and vardenafil may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some \npatients because both are vasodilators. Concomitant treatment with vardenafil should only be initiated if \nthe patient has been stabilised on his alpha-blocker therapy. In those patients who are stable on \nalpha-blocker therapy, vardenafil should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose of 5 mg \nfilm-coated tablets. Patients treated with alpha-blockers should not use Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible \ntablets as a starting dose. Vardenafil may be administered at any time with tamsulosin or with alfuzosin. \nWith other alpha-blockers a time separation of dosing should be considered when vardenafil is \nprescribed concomitantly (see section 4.5). In those patients already taking an optimised dose of \nvardenafil, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in \nalpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking \nvardenafil.  \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of vardenafil with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole and ketoconazole \n(oral form) should be avoided as very high plasma concentrations of vardenafil are reached if the \nmedicinal products are combined (see sections 4.5 and 4.3). \n \nVardenafil dose adjustment might be necessary if moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin \nand clarithromycin, are given concomitantly (see section 4.2 and 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nConcomitant intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of \nvardenafil. The combination should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nEffect on QTc interval \nSingle oral doses of 10 mg and 80 mg of vardenafil have been shown to prolong the QTc interval by a \nmean of 8 msec and 10 msec, respectively. And single doses of 10 mg vardenafil co-administered \nconcomitantly with 400 mg gatifloxacin, an active substance with comparable QT effect, showed an \nadditive QTc effect of 4 msec when compared to either active substance alone. The clinical impact of \nthese QT changes is unknown (see section 5.1). \nThe clinical relevance of this finding is unknown and cannot be generalised to all patients under all \ncircumstances, as it will depend on the individual risk factors and susceptibilities that may be present at \nany time in any given patient. Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval, including vardenafil, \nare best avoided in patients with relevant risk factors, for example, hypokalaemia, congenital QT \nprolongation, concomitant administration of antiarrhythmic medicinal products in Class IA (e.g. \nquinidine, procainamide), or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol). \n \nEffect on vision \nVisual defects and cases of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have been reported in \nconnection with the intake of Vivanza and other PDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data \nsuggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with erectile dysfunction following exposure to PDE5 \ninhibitors such as vardenafil, tadalafil and sildenafil (see section 4.8). As this may be relevant for all \npatients exposed to vardenafil the patient should be advised that in the case of sudden visual defect, he \nshould stop taking Vivanza orodispersible tablets and consult immediately a physician (see section 4.3). \n \nEffect on bleeding \nIn vitro studies with human platelets indicate that vardenafil has no antiaggregatory effect on its own, \nbut at high (super-therapeutic) concentrations vardenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of the \nnitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside. In humans vardenafil had no effect on bleeding time alone or in \ncombination with acetylsalicylic acid (see section 4.5). There is no safety information available on the \nadministration of vardenafil to patients with bleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration. Therefore \nvardenafil should be administered to these patients only after careful benefit-risk assessment. \n \nAspartame \nThis medicine contains 1.80 mg aspartame in each 10 mg orodispersible tablet. Aspartame is a source of \nphenylalanine. It may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in \nwhich phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicine contains 7.96 mg sorbitol in each 10 mg orodispersible tablet.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on vardenafil \nIn vitro studies \nVardenafil is metabolised predominantly by hepatic enzymes via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 3A4, \nwith some contribution from CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes \nreduce vardenafil clearance. \n \nIn vivo studies \nCo-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir (800 mg three times a day), a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, with vardenafil (10 mg film-coated tablets) resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC \nand a 7-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax. At 24 hours, the plasma levels of vardenafil had fallen to \napproximately 4% of the maximum vardenafil plasma level (Cmax).  \n \nCo-administration of vardenafil with ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) resulted in a 13-fold increase in \nvardenafil Cmax and a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC0-24 when co-administered with vardenafil \n5 mg. The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of vardenafil by ritonavir, a \n\n\n\n20 \n\nhighly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9. Ritonavir significantly prolonged the \nhalf-life of vardenafil to 25.7 hours (see section 4.3).  \n \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, with vardenafil (5 mg) \nresulted in a 10-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 4-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax (see section \n4.4). \n \nAlthough specific interaction studies have not been conducted, the concomitant use of other potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (such as itraconazole) can be expected to produce vardenafil plasma levels \ncomparable to those produced by ketoconazole. Concomitant use of vardenafil with potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors such as itraconazole and ketoconazole (oral use) should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nIn men older than 75 years the concomitant use of vardenafil with itraconazole or ketoconazole is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, with vardenafil \n(5 mg) resulted in a 4-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 3-fold increase in Cmax. Although a specific \ninteraction study has not been conducted, the co-administration of clarithromycin can be expected to \nresult in similar effects on vardenafil AUC and Cmax. When used in combination with a moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitor such as erythromycin or clarithromycin, vardenafil dose adjustment might be \nnecessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCimetidine (400 mg twice daily), a non-specific cytochrome P450 inhibitor, had no effect on vardenafil \nAUC and Cmax when co-administered with vardenafil (20 mg) to healthy volunteers. \n \nGrapefruit juice being a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 gut wall metabolism, may give rise to modest \nincreases in plasma levels of vardenafil (see section 4.4). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of vardenafil (20 mg) was not affected by co-administration with the \nH2-antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), digoxin, warfarin, glibenclamide, alcohol (mean \nmaximum blood alcohol level of 73 mg/dl) or single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminium \nhydroxide). \n \nAlthough specific interaction studies were not conducted for all medicinal products, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect on vardenafil pharmacokinetics of the following \nconcomitant medicinal products: acetylsalicylic acid, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, weak CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, diuretics and medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes (sulfonylureas and metformin). \n \nEffects of vardenafil on other medicinal products \nThere are no data on the interaction of vardenafil and non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as \ntheophylline or dipyridamole. \n \nIn vivo studies \nNo potentiation of the blood pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) was observed \nwhen vardenafil (10 mg) was given at varying time intervals (1 h to 24 h) prior to the dose of \nnitroglycerin in a study in 18 healthy male subjects. Vardenafil 20 mg film-coated tablets potentiated the \nblood pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil \nadministration to healthy middle aged subjects. No effect on blood pressure was observed when \nnitroglycerin was taken 24 hours after administration of a single dose of vardenafil 20 mg film-coated \ntablets. However, there is no information on the possible potentiation of the hypotensive effects of \nnitrates by vardenafil in patients, and concomitant use of Vivanza orodispersible tablets and nitrates is \ntherefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nNicorandil is a hybrid of potassium channel opener and nitrate. Due to the nitrate component it has the \npotential to have serious interaction with vardenafil. \n \nSince alpha-blocker monotherapy can cause marked lowering of blood pressure, especially postural \nhypotension and syncope, interaction studies were conducted with vardenafil. In two interaction studies \n\n\n\n21 \n\nwith healthy normotensive volunteers after forced titration of the alpha-blockers tamsulosin or terazosin \nto high doses, hypotension (in some cases symptomatic) was reported in a significant number of subjects \nafter co-administration of vardenafil. Among subjects treated with terazosin, hypotension was observed \nmore frequently when vardenafil and terazosin were given simultaneously than when the dosing was \nseparated by a time interval of 6 hours. \n \nBased on the results of interaction studies conducted with vardenafil in patients with benign prostatic \nhyperplasia (BPH) on stable tamsulosin, terazosin or alfuzosin therapy: \n \n\u2022 When vardenafil (film-coated tablets) was given at doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg on a background of \n\nstable therapy with tamsulosin, there was no symptomatic reduction in blood pressure, although \n3/21 tamsulosin treated subjects exhibited transient standing systolic blood pressures of less than \n85 mmHg. \n\n\u2022 When vardenafil 5 mg (film-coated tablets) was given simultaneously with terazosin 5 or 10 mg, \none of 21 patients experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. Hypotension was not observed \nwhen vardenafil 5 mg and terazosin administration was separated by 6 hours. \n\n\u2022 When vardenafil (film-coated tablets) was given at doses of 5 or 10 mg on a background of stable \ntherapy with alfuzosin, compared to placebo, there was no symptomatic reduction in blood \npressure.   \n\n \nTherefore, concomitant treatment should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha-blocker \ntherapy. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, vardenafil should be initiated at the \nlowest recommended starting dose of 5mg. Vivanza may be administered at any time with tamsulosin or \nalfuzosin. With other alpha-blockers a time separation of dosing should be considered when vardenafil \nis prescribed concomitantly (see section 4.4). \n \nVivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets should not be taken as starting dose in patients treated with \nalpha-blockers (see section 4.4).  \n \nNo significant interactions were shown when warfarin (25 mg), which is metabolised by CYP2C9, or \ndigoxin (0.375 mg) was co-administered with vardenafil (20 mg film-coated tablets).  \nThe relative bioavailability of glibenclamide (3.5 mg) was not affected when co-administered with \nvardenafil (20 mg). In a specific study, where vardenafil (20 mg) was co-administered with slow release \nnifedipine (30 mg or 60 mg) in hypertensive patients, there was an additional reduction on supine \nsystolic blood pressure of 6 mmHg and supine diastolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg accompanied with \nan increase in heart rate of 4 bpm.  \n \nWhen vardenafil (20 mg film-coated tablets) and alcohol (mean maximum blood alcohol level of \n73 mg/dl) were taken together, vardenafil did not potentiate the effects of alcohol on blood pressure and \nheart rate and the pharmacokinetics of vardenafil were not altered. \n \nVardenafil (10 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetylsalicylic acid \n(2 x 81 mg). \n \nRiociguat \nPreclinical studies showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were \ncombined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive \neffects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the \npopulation studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nVivanza is not indicated for use by women. There are no studies of vardenafil in pregnant women. \nThere are no fertility data available. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nAs dizziness and abnormal vision have been reported in clinical trials with vardenafil, patients should be \naware of how they react to Vivanza orodispersible tablets, before driving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reactions reported with Vivanza film-coated tablets or 10 mg orodispersible tablets in \nclinical trials were generally transient and mild to moderate in nature. The most commonly reported \nadverse drug reaction occurring in \u2265 10% of patients is headache. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the MedDRA frequency convention: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and not \nknown (can not be estimated from available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported: \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nNot known  \n(cannot be \nestimated from \nthe available \ndata) \n\nInfection and \ninfestations \n\n   Conjunctivitis  \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Allergic oedema \nand angioedema  \n\nAllergic \nreaction  \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  Sleep disorder Anxiety  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness Somnolence \nParaesthesia and \ndysaesthesia \n\nSyncope \nSeizure  \nAmnesia \nTransient \nischaemic \nattack \n\nCerebral \nhaemorrhage \n\nEye disorders    Visual \ndisturbance  \nOcular \nhyperaemia \nVisual colour \ndistortions  \nEye pain and eye \ndiscomfort  \nPhotophobia \n\nIncrease in \nintraocular \npressure \nLacrimation \nincreased \n\nNon-arteritic \nanterior \nischemic optic \nneuropathy \nVisual defects \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Tinnitus \nVertigo \n\n Sudden \ndeafness \n\nCardiac \ndisorders  \n\n  Palpitation \nTachycardia \n\nMyocardial \ninfarction \nVentricular \ntachy-arrhyth-\n\nSudden death \n\n\n\n23 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nNot known  \n(cannot be \nestimated from \nthe available \ndata) \n\nmias \nAngina pectoris \n\nVascular \ndisorders  \n\n Flushing  Hypotension \nHypertension \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Nasal \ncongestion  \n\nDyspnoea \nSinus congestion \n\nEpistaxis  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\n Dyspepsia  Gastro-oesopha-\ngeal reflux \ndisease  \nGastritis \nGastrointestinal \nand abdominal \npain \nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea \nDry mouth  \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Increase in \ntransaminases \n\nIncrease in \ngamma-gluta-\nmyl transferase \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Erythema \nRash \n\nPhotosensiti-\nvity reaction \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Back pain  \nIncrease in \ncreatine \nphosphokinase \nMyalgia  \nIncreased muscle \ntone and \ncramping \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    Haematuria \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n  Increase in \nerection  \n\nPriapism Penile \nHaemorrhage \nHaematosper-\nmia \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n  Feeling unwell  Chest pain   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPenile haemorrhage, haematospermia and haematuria have been reported in clinical trials and \nspontaneous post-marketing data with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nAt a dose of 20 mg Vivanza film-coated tablets, elderly (\u2265 65 years old) patients had higher frequencies \nof headaches (16.2% versus 11.8%) and dizziness (3.7% versus 0.7%) than younger patients (<65 years \nold). In general, the incidence of adverse reactions (especially \u201cdizziness\u201d) has been shown to be slightly \nhigher in patients with a history of hypertension. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn single dose volunteer studies, doses up to and including 80 mg vardenafil (film-coated tablets) per \nday were tolerated without exhibiting serious adverse reactions.   \n \nWhen vardenafil was administered in higher doses and more frequently than the recommended dose \nregimen (40 mg film-coated tablets twice daily) cases of severe back pain have been reported. This was \nnot associated with any muscle or neurological toxicity. \n \nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not \nexpected to accelerate clearance, as vardenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not significantly \neliminated in the urine. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC code: G04BE09. \n \nVardenafil is an oral therapy for the improvement of erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction. \nIn the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation it restores impaired erectile function by increasing \nblood flow to the penis. \n \nPenile erection is a haemodynamic process. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released. It \nactivates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increased level of cyclic guanosine \nmonophosphate (cGMP) in the corpus cavernosum. This in turn results in smooth muscle relaxation, \nallowing increased inflow of blood into the penis. The level of cGMP is regulated by the rate of \nsynthesis via guanylate cyclase and by the rate of degradation via cGMP hydrolysing \nphosphodiesterases (PDEs).  \n \nVardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the \nmost prominent PDE in the human corpus cavernosum. Vardenafil potently enhances the effect of \nendogenous nitric oxide in the corpus cavernosum by inhibiting PDE5. When nitric oxide is released in \nresponse to sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum \nlevels of cGMP. Sexual stimulation is therefore required for vardenafil to produce its beneficial \ntherapeutic effects. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that vardenafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other known \nphosphodiesterases (>15-fold relative to PDE6, >130-fold relative to PDE1, >300-fold relative to \nPDE11, and >1000-fold relative to PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9 and PDE10).  \n \nIn a penile plesthysmography (RigiScan) study, vardenafil 20 mg produced erections considered \nsufficient for penetration (60% rigidity by RigiScan) in some men as early as 15 minutes after dosing. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n\nThe overall response of these subjects to vardenafil became statistically significant, compared to \nplacebo, 25 minutes after dosing. \n \nVardenafil causes mild and transient decreases in blood pressure which, in the majority of the cases, do \nnot translate into clinical effects. The mean maximum decreases in supine systolic blood pressure \nfollowing 20 mg and 40 mg vardenafil were \u2013 6.9 mmHg under 20 mg and \u2013 4.3 mmHg under 40 mg of \nvardenafil, when compared to placebo. These effects are consistent with the vasodilatory effects of \nPDE5-inhibitors and are probably due to increased cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells. Single \nand multiple oral doses of vardenafil up to 40 mg produced no clinically relevant changes in the ECGs \nof normal male volunteers.  \n \nA single dose, double blind, crossover, randomised trial in 59 healthy males compared the effects on the \nQT interval of vardenafil (10 mg and 80 mg), sildenafil (50 mg and 400 mg) and placebo. Moxifloxacin \n(400 mg) was included as an active internal control. Effects on the QT interval were measured one hour \npost-dose (average tmax for vardenafil). The primary objective of this study was to rule out a greater than \n10 msec effect (i.e. to demonstrate lack of effect) of a single 80 mg oral dose of vardenafil on QTc \ninterval compared to placebo, as measured by the change in Fridericia's correction formula \n(QTcF=QT/RR1/3) from baseline at the 1 hour post-dose time point. The vardenafil results showed an \nincrease in QTc (Fridericia) of 8 msec (90% CI: 6-9) and 10 msec (90% CI: 8-11) at 10 and 80 mg doses \ncompared to placebo and an increase in QTci of 4 msec (90% CI: 3-6) and 6 msec (90% CI: 4-7) at 10 \nand 80 mg doses compared to placebo, at one hour post-dose. At tmax, only the mean change in QTcF for \nvardenafil 80 mg was out of the study established limit (mean 10 msec, 90% CI: 8-11). When using the \nindividual correction formulae, none of the values were out of the limit. \n \nIn a separate post-marketing study of 44 healthy volunteers, single doses of 10 mg vardenafil or 50 mg \nsildenafil were co-administered concomitantly with 400 mg gatifloxacin, a drug with comparable QT \neffect. Both vardenafil and sildenafil showed an increase of Fridericia QTc effect of 4 msec (vardenafil) \nand 5 msec (sildenafil) when compared to either drug alone. The actual clinical impact of these QT \nchanges is unknown. \n \nFurther information on clinical trials with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets \nEfficacy and safety of vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets were separately demonstrated in a broad \npopulation in two studies including 701 randomized erectile dysfunction patients who were treated up to \n12 weeks. The distribution of patients in the predefined subgroups was covering elderly patients (51%), \npatients with history of diabetes mellitus (29%), dyslipidemia (39%) and hypertension (40%).   \n \nIn pooled data from the two vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets trials, IIEF-EF domain scores were \nsignificantly higher with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablet versus placebo. \n \nA percentage of 71% of all sexual attempts reported in the clinical trials had successful penetration \ncompared to 44% of all attempts in the placebo group. These results were also reflected in subgroups, in \nelderly patients (65%), in patients with history of diabetes mellitus (63%), patients with history of \ndyslipidemia (66%) and hypertension (70%) of all sexual attempts reported had successful penetration. \n \nAbout 63% of all reported sexual attempts with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets were successful \nin terms of erection maintenance compared to about 26% of all placebo-controlled sexual attempts. In \nthe predefined subgroups 57% (elderly patients), 56% (patients with history of diabetes mellitus), 59% \n(patients with history of dyslipidemia) and 60% (patients with history of hypertension) of all reported \nattempts with vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets were successful in terms of maintenance of \nerection. \n \nFurther information on clinical trials \nIn clinical trials vardenafil was administered to over 17,000 men with erectile dysfunction (ED) aged \n18 - 89 years, many of whom had multiple co-morbid conditions. Over 2,500 patients have been treated \nwith vardenafil for 6 months or longer. Of these, 900 patients have been treated for one year or longer.  \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nThe following patient groups were represented: elderly (22%), patients with hypertension (35%), \ndiabetes mellitus (29%), ischaemic heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases (7%), chronic \npulmonary disease (5%), hyperlipidaemia (22%), depression (5%), radical prostatectomy (9%). The \nfollowing groups were not well represented in clinical trials: elderly (>75 years, 2.4%), and patients with \ncertain cardiovascular conditions (see section 4.3). No clinical trials in CNS diseases (except spinal cord \ninjury), patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, pelvic surgery (except nerve-sparing \nprostatectomy) or trauma or radiotherapy and hypoactive sexual desire or penile anatomic deformities \nhave been performed. \n \nAcross the pivotal trials, treatment with vardenafil (film-coated tablets) resulted in an improvement of \nerectile function compared to placebo. In the small number of patients who attempted intercourse up to \nfour to five hours after dosing the success rate for penetration and maintenance of erection was \nconsistently greater than placebo.  \n \nIn fixed dose studies (film-coated tablets) in a broad population of men with erectile dysfunction, 68% \n(5 mg), 76% (10 mg) and 80% (20 mg) of patients experienced successful penetrations (SEP 2) \ncompared to 49% on placebo over a three month study period. The ability to maintain the erection \n(SEP 3) in this broad ED population was given as 53% (5 mg), 63% (10 mg) and 65% (20 mg) \ncompared to 29% on placebo. \n \nIn pooled data from the major efficacy trials, the proportion of patients experiencing successful \npenetration on vardenafil were as follows: psychogenic erectile dysfunction (77-87%), mixed erectile \ndysfunction (69-83%), organic erectile dysfunction (64-75%), elderly (52-75%), ischaemic heart \ndisease (70-73%), hyperlipidaemia (62-73%), chronic pulmonary disease (74-78%), depression \n(59-69%), and patients concomitantly treated with antihypertensives (62-73%). \n \nIn a clinical trial in patients with diabetes mellitus, vardenafil significantly improved the erectile \nfunction domain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful \nintercourse and penile rigidity compared to placebo at vardenafil doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. The \nresponse rates for the ability to obtain and maintain an erection was 61% and 49% on 10 mg and 64% \nand 54% on 20 mg vardenafil compared to 36% and 23% on placebo for patients who completed three \nmonths treatment. \n \nIn a clinical trial in post-prostatectomy patients, vardenafil significantly improved the erectile function \ndomain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse and \npenile rigidity compared to placebo at vardenafil doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. The response rates for the \nability to obtain and maintain an erection was 47% and 37% on 10 mg and 48% and 34% on 20 mg \nvardenafil compared to 22% and 10% on placebo for patients who completed three months treatment. \n \nIn a flexible-dose clinical trial in patients with Spinal Cord Injury, vardenafil significantly improved the \nerectile function domain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful \nintercourse and penile rigidity compared to placebo. The number of patients who returned to a normal \nIIEF domain score (>26) were 53% on vardenafil compared to 9% on placebo. The response rates for the \nability to obtain and maintain an erection were 76% and 59% on vardenafil compared to 41% and 22% \non placebo for patients who completed three months treatment which were clinically and statistically \nsignificant (p<0.001).  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of vardenafil was maintained in long term studies. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets \nof the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBioequivalence studies have shown that vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablet is not bioequivalent to \nvardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets. Therefore the orodispersible formulation should not be used as an \nequivalent to vardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets.  \n \nAbsorption \nIn vardenafil film-coated tablets, vardenafil is rapidly absorbed with maximum observed plasma \nconcentrations reached in some men as early as 15 minutes after oral administration. However, 90% of \nthe time, maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of \noral dosing in the fasted state. The mean absolute oral bioavailability is 15%. After oral dosing of \nvardenafil AUC and Cmax increase almost dose proportionally over the recommended dose range \n(5 - 20 mg). \n \nWhen Vivanza film-coated tablets are taken with a high fat meal (containing 57% fat), the rate of \nabsorption is reduced, with an increase in the median tmax of 1 hour and a mean reduction in Cmax of 20%. \nVardenafil AUC is not affected. After a meal containing 30% fat, the rate and extent of absorption of \nvardenafil (tmax, Cmax and AUC) are unchanged compared to administration under fasting conditions. \n \nVardenafil is rapidly absorbed after administration of Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets without \nwater. The median time to reach Cmax varied between 45 to 90 minutes and was similar or slightly \ndelayed (by 8 to 45 min) compared to the film-coated tablets. Mean vardenafil AUC was increased by \n21 to 29% (middle aged and elderly ED patients) or 44% (young healthy subjects) with 10 mg \norodispersible tablets compared to film-coated tablets as a result of local oral absorption of a small \namount of drug in the oral cavity. There was no consistent difference in mean Cmax between \norodispersible tablets and film-coated tablets. \n \nIn subjects taking vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets with a high fat meal no effect on vardenafil \nAUC and tmax was observed, while vardenafil Cmax was reduced by 35% in the fed condition. Based on \nthese results Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets are taken with water, the AUC is reduced by 29%, Cmax remains \nunchanged and median tmax is shortened by 60 minutes compared to intake without water. Vivanza \n10 mg orodispersible tablets must be taken without liquid. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean steady state volume of distribution for vardenafil is 208 l, indicating distribution into the \ntissues.  \n \nVardenafil and its major circulating metabolite (M1) are highly bound to plasma proteins \n(approximately 95% for vardenafil or M1). For vardenafil as well as M1, protein binding is independent \nof total drug concentrations.  \nBased on measurements of vardenafil in semen of healthy subjects 90 minutes after dosing, not more \nthan 0.00012% of the administered dose may appear in the semen of patients. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nVardenafil in Vivanza film-coated tablets is metabolised predominantly by hepatic metabolism via \ncytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 3A4 with some contribution from CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. \n \nIn humans the one major circulating metabolite (M1) results from desethylation of vardenafil and is \nsubject to further metabolism with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 4 hours. Parts of M1 \nare in the form of the glucuronide in systemic circulation. Metabolite M1 shows a phosphodiesterase \nselectivity profile similar to vardenafil and an in vitro potency for phosphodiesterase type 5 of \napproximately 28% compared to vardenafil, resulting in an efficacy contribution of about 7%. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThe mean terminal half-life of vardenafil in patients receiving Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets \nranged between 4 \u2013 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the metabolite M1 is between 3 to 5 hours, \nsimilar to parent drug. \n \nElimination \nThe total body clearance of vardenafil is 56 l/h with a resultant terminal half-life of approximately \n4-5 hours. After oral administration, vardenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the faeces \n(approximately 91-95% of the administered dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately \n2-6% of the administered dose). \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \nElderly \nHepatic clearance of vardenafil in healthy elderly volunteers (65 years and over) was reduced as \ncompared to healthy younger volunteers (18 - 45 years). On average elderly males taking Vivanza \nfilm-coated tablets had a 52% higher AUC, and a 34% higher Cmax than younger males (see section 4.2). \n \nVardenafil AUC and Cmax in elderly patients (65 years or over) taking vardenafil orodispersible tablets \nwere increased by 31 to 39% and 16 to 21%, respectively, in comparison to patients aged 45 years and \nbelow. Vardenafil was not found to accumulate in the plasma in patients aged 45 years and below or 65 \nyears or over following once-daily dosing of vardenafil 10 mg orodispersible tablets over ten days. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn volunteers with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 80 ml/min), the \npharmacokinetics of vardenafil were similar to that of a normal renal function control group. In \nvolunteers with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) the mean AUC was \nincreased by 21% and the mean Cmax decreased by 23%, compared to volunteers with no renal \nimpairment. No statistically significant correlation was observed between creatinine clearance and \nvardenafil exposure (AUC and Cmax) (see section 4.2). Vardenafil pharmacokinetics has not been \nstudied in patients requiring dialysis (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B), the clearance of vardenafil \nwas reduced in proportion to the degree of hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A), the mean AUC and Cmax increased by 17% and 22% respectively, compared to healthy \ncontrol subjects. In patients with moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B), the mean AUC and Cmax \nincreased by 160% and 133% respectively, compared to healthy control subjects (see section 4.2). The \npharmacokinetics of vardenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh C) has \nnot been studied (see section 4.3). \n \nAdditional information \nIn vitro data suggest that effects of vardenafil on P-glycoprotein substrates more sensitive than digoxin \ncannot be excluded. Dabigatran etexilate is an example for highly sensitive intestinal P-glycoprotein \nsubstrates. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vivanza is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Vivanza \n3. How to take Vivanza \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vivanza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vivanza is and what it is used for \n \nVivanza contains vardenafil, a member of a class of medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 \ninhibitors. They are used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men, a condition which \nimplies difficulties in getting or keeping an erection. \n \nAt least one in ten men has trouble getting or keeping an erection at some time. There may be physical or \npsychological causes, or a mixture of both. Whatever the cause is, due to muscle and blood vessel \nchanges not enough blood stays in the penis to make it hard and keep it hard. \n \nVivanza will only work when you are sexually stimulated. It reduces the action of the natural chemical \nin your body which makes erections go away. Vivanza allows an erection to last long enough for you to \nsatisfactorily complete sexual activity. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vivanza  \n \nDo not take Vivanza \n- If you are allergic to vardenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Signs of an allergic reaction include a rash, itching, swollen face or lips and shortness of \nbreath. \n\n- If you are taking medicines containing nitrates, such as glycerol trinitrate for angina, or nitric \noxide donors, such as amyl nitrite. Taking these medicines with Vivanza could seriously affect \nyour blood pressure. \n\n- If you are taking ritonavir or indinavir, medicines used to treat human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) infections. \n\n- If you are over 75 years of age and are taking ketoconazole or itraconazole, anti-fungal medicines. \n- If you have a severe heart or liver problem. \n- If you are having kidney dialysis. \n- If you have recently had a stroke or heart attack. \n- If you have or have had low blood pressure. \n- If your family has a history of degenerative eye diseases (such as retinitis pigmentosa). \n\n\n\n49 \n\n- If you have ever had a condition involving loss of vision due to damage to the optic nerve from \ninsufficient blood supply known as non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). \n\n- If you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e. high \nblood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e. high \nblood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Vivanza have been \nshown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are \nunsure tell your doctor. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vivanza. \n \nTake special care with Vivanza \n- If you have heart trouble. It may be risky for you to have sex. \n- If you suffer from irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia) or inherited heart diseases affecting \n\nyour electrocardiogram. \n- If you have a physical condition affecting the shape of the penis. This includes conditions called \n\nangulation, Peyronie\u2019s disease and cavernosal fibrosis. \n- If you have an illness that can cause erections which won\u2019t go away (priapism). These include \n\nsickle cell disease, multiple myeloma and leukaemia. \n- If you have stomach ulcers (also called gastric or peptic ulcers). \n- If you have a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia). \n- If you are using any other treatments for erection difficulties, including Vivanza orodispersible \n\ntablets (see section Other medicines and Vivanza). \n- If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Vivanza and contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVivanza is not intended for use by children or adolescents under 18. \n \nOther medicines and Vivanza \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \nSome medicines may cause problems, especially these: \n- Nitrates, medicines for angina, or nitric oxide donors, such as amyl nitrite. Taking these \n\nmedicines with Vivanza could seriously affect your blood pressure. \n- Medicine for the treatment of arrhythmias, such as quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone or \n\nsotalol. \n- Ritonavir or indinavir, medicines for HIV. \n- Ketoconazole or itraconazole, anti-fungal medicines. \n- Erythromycin or clarithromycin, macrolide antibiotics. \n- Alpha-blockers, a type of medicine used to treat high blood pressure and enlargement of the \n\nprostate (as benign prostatic hyperplasia). \n- Riociguat. \n \nDo not use Vivanza film-coated tablets combined with any other treatment for erectile dysfunction, \nincluding Vivanza orodispersible tablets. \n \nVivanza with food, drink and alcohol \n- You can take Vivanza with or without food but preferably not after a heavy or high-fat meal as this \n\nmay delay the effect. \n- Don\u2019t drink grapefruit juice when you use Vivanza. It can interfere with the usual effect of the \n\nmedicine. \n- Alcoholic drink can make erection difficulties worse. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nVivanza is not for use by women. \n \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_loss\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_loss\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve\n\n\n50 \n\nDriving and using machines \nVivanza might make some people feel dizzy or affect their vision. If you feel dizzy, or if your vision is \naffected after taking Vivanza don\u2019t drive or operate any tools or machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Vivanza \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. The recommended dose is 10 mg. \n \nTake a Vivanza tablet about 25 to 60 minutes before sexual activity. With sexual stimulation you may \nachieve an erection anywhere from 25 minutes up to four to five hours after taking Vivanza. \n- Swallow one tablet with a glass of water. \n \nDo not take Vivanza film-coated tablets with any other forms of Vivanza. \n \nDo not take Vivanza more than once a day. \n \nTell your doctor if you think Vivanza is too strong or too weak. He or she may suggest a switch to an \nalternative vardenafil formulation with a different dose, depending on how well it works for you. \n \nIf you take more Vivanza than you should \nMen who take too much Vivanza may experience more side effects or may get severe back pain. If you \ntake more Vivanza than you should, tell your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of the \neffects are mild or moderate.  \n \nPartial, sudden, temporary or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes has been \nexperienced by patients. Stop taking Vivanza and contact your doctor immediately. \nSudden decrease or loss of hearing has been reported. \n \nCases of sudden death, fast or altered heart beat, heart attack, chest pain, and trouble in cerebral \ncirculation (including temporarily decreased blood flow to parts of the brain and bleeding in the brain) \nhave been reported in men taking vardenafil.

What you need to know before you take Vivanza \n3. How to take Vivanza \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vivanza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vivanza is and what it is used for \n \nVivanza contains vardenafil, a member of a class of medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 \ninhibitors. They are used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men, a condition which \nimplies difficulties in getting or keeping an erection. \n \nAt least one in ten men has trouble getting or keeping an erection at some time. There may be physical or \npsychological causes, or a mixture of both. Whatever the cause is, due to muscle and blood vessel \nchanges not enough blood stays in the penis to make it hard and keep it hard. \n \nVivanza will only work when you are sexually stimulated. It reduces the action of the natural chemical \nin your body which makes erections go away. Vivanza allows an erection to last long enough for you to \nsatisfactorily complete sexual activity. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vivanza  \n \nDo not take Vivanza \n- If you are allergic to vardenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Signs of an allergic reaction include a rash, itching, swollen face or lips and shortness of \nbreath. \n\n- If you are taking medicines containing nitrates, such as glycerol trinitrate for angina, or nitric \noxide donors, such as amyl nitrite. Taking these medicines with Vivanza could seriously affect \nyour blood pressure. \n\n- If you are taking ritonavir or indinavir, medicines used to treat human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) infections. \n\n- If you are over 75 years of age and are taking ketoconazole or itraconazole, anti-fungal medicines. \n- If you have a severe heart or liver problem. \n- If you are having kidney dialysis. \n- If you have recently had a stroke or heart attack. \n- If you have or have had low blood pressure. \n- If your family has a history of degenerative eye diseases (such as retinitis pigmentosa) \n\n\n\n55 \n\n- If you have ever had a condition involving loss of vision due to damage to the optic nerve from \ninsufficient blood supply known as non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). \n\n- If you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e. high \nblood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e. high \nblood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Vivanza have been \nshown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are \nunsure tell your doctor. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vivanza. \n \nTake special care with Vivanza \n- If you have heart trouble. It may be risky for you to have sex. \n- If you suffer from irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia) or inherited heart diseases affecting \n\nyour electrocardiogram. \n- If you have a physical condition affecting the shape of the penis. This includes conditions called \n\nangulation, Peyronie\u2019s disease and cavernosal fibrosis. \n- If you have an illness that can cause erections which won\u2019t go away (priapism). These include \n\nsickle cell disease, multiple myeloma and leukaemia. \n- If you have stomach ulcers (also called gastric or peptic ulcers). \n- If you have a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia). \n- If you are using any other treatments for erection difficulties, including Vivanza orodispersible \n\ntablets (see section Other medicines and Vivanza). \n- If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Vivanza and contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVivanza is not intended for use by children or adolescents under 18. \n \nOther medicines and Vivanza \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \nSome medicines may cause problems, especially these: \n- Nitrates, medicines for angina, or nitric oxide donors, such as amyl nitrite. Taking these \n\nmedicines with Vivanza could seriously affect your blood pressure. \n- Medicine for the treatment of arrhythmias, such as quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone or \n\nsotalol. \n- Ritonavir or indinavir, medicines for HIV. \n- Ketoconazole or itraconazole, anti-fungal medicines. \n- Erythromycin or clarithromycin, macrolide antibiotics. \n- Alpha-blockers, a type of medicine used to treat high blood pressure and enlargement of the \n\nprostate (as benign prostatic hyperplasia). \n- Riociguat. \n \nDo not use Vivanza film-coated tablets combined with any other treatment for erectile dysfunction, \nincluding Vivanza orodispersible tablets. \n \nVivanza with food, drink and alcohol \n- You can take Vivanza with or without food but preferably not after a heavy or high-fat meal as this \n\nmay delay the effect. \n- Don\u2019t drink grapefruit juice when you use Vivanza.

The recommended dose is 10 mg. \n \nTake a Vivanza tablet about 25 to 60 minutes before sexual activity. With sexual stimulation, you may \nachieve an erection anywhere from 25 minutes up to four to five hours after taking Vivanza. \n- Swallow one tablet with a glass of water. \n \nDo not take Vivanza film-coated tablets with any other forms of Vivanza. \n \nDo not take Vivanza more than once a day. \n \nTell your doctor if you think Vivanza is too strong or too weak. He or she may suggest a switch to an \nalternative vardenafil formulation with a different dose, depending on how well it works for you. \n \nIf you take more Vivanza than you should \nMen who take too much Vivanza may experience more side effects or may get severe back pain. If you \ntake more Vivanza than you should, tell your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What you need to know before you take Vivanza \n3. How to take Vivanza \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vivanza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vivanza is and what it is used for \n \nVivanza contains vardenafil, a member of a class of medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 \ninhibitors. They are used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men, a condition which \nimplies difficulties in getting or keeping an erection. \n \nAt least one in ten men has trouble getting or keeping an erection at some time. There may be physical or \npsychological causes, or a mixture of both. Whatever the cause is, due to muscle and blood vessel \nchanges not enough blood stays in the penis to make it hard and keep it hard. \n \nVivanza will only work when you are sexually stimulated. It reduces the action of the natural chemical \nin your body which makes erections go away. Vivanza allows an erection to last long enough for you to \nsatisfactorily complete sexual activity. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vivanza \n \nDo not take Vivanza \n- If you are allergic to vardenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Signs of an allergic reaction include a rash, itching, swollen face or lips and shortness of \nbreath. \n\n- If you are taking medicines containing nitrates, such as glycerol trinitrate for angina, or nitric \noxide donors, such as amyl nitrite. Taking these medicines with Vivanza could seriously affect \nyour blood pressure.  \n\n- If you are taking ritonavir or indinavir, medicines used to treat human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) infections. \n\n- If you are over 75 years of age and are taking ketoconazole or itraconazole, anti-fungal medicines. \n- If you have a severe heart or liver problem. \n- If you are having kidney dialysis. \n- If you have recently had a stroke or heart attack. \n- If you have or have had low blood pressure. \n- If your family has a history of degenerative eye diseases (such as retinitis pigmentosa). \n\n\n\n67 \n\n- If you have ever had a condition involving loss of vision due to damage to the optic nerve from \ninsufficient blood supply known as non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). \n\n- If you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e. high \nblood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e. high \nblood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Vivanza have been \nshown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are \nunsure tell your doctor. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vivanza. \n \nTake special care with Vivanza  \n- If you have heart trouble. It may be risky for you to have sex. \n- If you suffer from irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia) or inherited heart diseases affecting \n\nyour electrocardiogram. \n- If you have a physical condition affecting the shape of the penis. This includes conditions called \n\nangulation, Peyronie\u2019s disease and cavernosal fibrosis. \n- If you have an illness that can cause erections which won\u2019t go away (priapism). These include \n\nsickle cell disease, multiple myeloma and leukaemia. \n- If you have stomach ulcers (also called gastric or peptic ulcers). \n- If you have a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia). \n- If you are using any other treatments for erection difficulties, including Vivanza film-coated \n\ntablets (see section Other medicines and Vivanza). \n- If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Vivanza and contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVivanza is not intended for use by children or adolescents under 18. \n \nOther medicines and Vivanza \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \nSome medicines may cause problems, especially these: \n- Nitrates, medicines for angina, or nitric oxide donors, such as amyl nitrite.
