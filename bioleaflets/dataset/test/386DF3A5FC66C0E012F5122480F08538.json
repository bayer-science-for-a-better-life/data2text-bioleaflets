This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEmgality 120 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 120 mg of galcanezumab in 1 mL. \n \nGalcanezumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \ncells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nThe solution is clear and colourless to slightly yellow. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEmgality is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per \nmonth. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 120 mg galcanezumab injected subcutaneously once monthly, with a \n240 mg loading dose as the initial dose. \n \nPatients should be instructed to inject a missed dose as soon as possible and then resume monthly \ndosing. \n \nThe treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further \ndecision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to \ncontinue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter. \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nThere is limited information in subjects aged \u2265 65 years. No dose adjustment is required as the \npharmacokinetics of galcanezumab are not affected by age.   \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment/hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of galcanezumab in children aged 6 to 18 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of galcanezumab in children below the age of 6 years for the prevention of \nmigraine.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nA patient may self-inject galcanezumab by following the Instructions for Use. Galcanezumab is to be \ninjected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, back of the upper arm, or in the gluteal region. After \ntraining, patients may self-inject galcanezumab if a healthcare professional determines that it is \nappropriate. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the Package Leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCardiovascular risk \n \nPatients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see \nsection 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. \n \nSerious hypersensitivity \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions including cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema and urticaria have been \nreported. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of galcanezumab should be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nExcipients  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, i.e., is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo drug interaction studies were conducted. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions are expected based \non the characteristics of galcanezumab.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of galcanezumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nHuman immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. As a precautionary measure, it \nis preferable to avoid the use of galcanezumab during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether galcanezumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be excreted \nin breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \nafterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. \nAfterwards, use of galcanezumab could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed.  \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of galcanezumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Fertility studies in animals do \nnot indicate harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGalcanezumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo may \noccur following the administration of galcanezumab (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nOver 2500 patients were exposed to galcanezumab in clinical studies in migraine prophylaxis. Over \n1400 patients were exposed to galcanezumab during the double-blind treatment phase of the placebo-\ncontrolled phase 3 studies. 279  patients were exposed for 12 months. \n \nThe reported adverse drug reactions for 120 mg and 240 mg in the migraine clinical trials were injection \nsite pain (10.1 %/11.6 %),  injection site reactions (9.9 %/14.5 %), vertigo (0.7 %/1.2 %), constipation \n(1.0 %/1.5 %), pruritus (0.7 %/1.2 %) and urticaria (0.3 %/0.1 %). Most of the reactions were mild or \nmoderate in severity. Less than 2.5 % of patients in these studies discontinued due to adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1. List of adverse reactions in clinical studies and post-marketing reports \nFrequency estimate: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylaxis \nAngioedema \n\nEar and Labyrinth \nSystem \n\n Vertigo   \n\nGastrointestinal \nSystem \n\n Constipation   \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneous \nTissue \n\n Pruritus \nRash \n\nUrticaria  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \npain \nInjection site \nreactionsa \n\n   \n\na Most frequently reported terms (\u2265 1 %) were: Injection site reaction, Injection site erythema, \nInjection site pruritus, Injection site bruising, Injection site swelling. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site pain or reactions  \nThe majority of events related to the injection site were mild to moderate and less than 0.5 % of \npatients exposed to galcanezumab during the phase 3 studies discontinued the treatment due to an \ninjection site reaction. The majority of injection site reactions were reported within 1 day and on \naverage resolved within 5 days. In 86 % of the patients reporting injection site pain, the event occurred \nwithin 1 hour of injection and resolved on average in 1 day. One percent of the patients exposed to \ngalcanezumab during the phase 3 studies experienced severe pain at the injection site. \n \nUrticaria \nWhile urticaria is uncommon, serious cases of urticaria have been reported in galcanezumab clinical \nstudies. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the clinical studies, the incidence of anti-drug antibody development during the double-blind \ntreatment phase was 4.8 % in patients receiving galcanezumab once monthly (all but one of whom had \nin vitro neutralizing activity). With 12 months of treatment, up to 12.5 % of galcanezumab-treated \npatients developed anti-drug antibodies, most of which were of low titre and tested positive for \nneutralising activity in vitro. However, the presence of anti-drug antibodies did not affect the \npharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of galcanezumab. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 600 mg have been administered subcutaneously to humans without dose-limiting toxicity. \nIn case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, ATC \ncode: N02CD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nGalcanezumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds calcitonin gene-related peptide \n(CGRP) thus preventing its biological activity. Elevated blood concentrations of CGRP have been \nassociated with migraine attacks. Galcanezumab binds to CGRP with high affinity (KD = 31 pM) and \nhigh specificity (> 10,000-fold vs related peptides adrenomedullin, amylin, calcitonin and intermedin).  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of galcanezumab has been studied in 3 phase 3, randomized, placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind studies in adult patients (N = 2886). The 2 episodic migraine studies \n(EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2) enrolled patients who met International Classification of Headache \nDisorders (ICHD) criteria for a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura with 4-14 migraine \nheadache days per month. The chronic migraine study (REGAIN) enrolled patients who met ICHD \ncriteria for chronic migraine with \u2265 15 headache days per month, of which at least 8 had the features \nof migraine. Patients with recent acute cardiovascular events (including MI, unstable angina, CABG, \nstroke, DVT) and/or those deemed to be at serious cardiovascular risk were excluded from the \ngalcanezumab clinical trials. Patients > 65 years of age were also excluded. \n \nPatients received placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the \nfirst month) or galcanezumab 240 mg/month and were allowed to use medication for the acute \ntreatment of migraine. Across the 3 studies, patients were predominantly female (> 83 %) with a mean \nage of 41 years, and an average migraine history of 20 to 21 years. Approximately one-third of \npatients across the studies had at least 1 prior failure on a migraine prophylactic treatment for efficacy \nreasons and approximately 16 % of patients across the studies had at least 2 prior failure on a \nprophylactic treatment for efficacy reasons. \n \nIn all 3 studies, the overall mean change from baseline in number of monthly Migraine Headache \nDays (MHDs) was the primary efficacy measure. Response rate is the mean percentage of patients \nmeeting a defined threshold in the reduction of the number of monthly MHDs (\u2265 50 %, \u2265 75 % and \n100 %) across the double-blind treatment period. The impact of migraine on functioning was assessed \nby the Role Function-Restrictive domain of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire \n(MSQ) version 2.1, and by the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire. The MSQ \nmeasures impact of migraine on work or daily activities, relationships with family and friends, leisure \ntime, productivity, concentration, energy, and tiredness. Scoring ranges from 0 to 100, with higher \nscores indicating less impairment , that is, patients experience fewer restrictions on the performance of \nday-to-day activities. For the MIDAS, higher scores indicate more disability. The baseline scores of \nthe MIDAS reflected severe migraine related disability of patients in EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 \n(mean of 33.1) and a very severely disabled population (mean of 67.2) in REGAIN.   \n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nEpisodic migraine \nStudies EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 had a 6 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment \nperiod. Completion rate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab \nranged from 82.8 % to 87.7 %.  \n \nBoth galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see \nTable 2). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the \nnumber of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. \nGalcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ \nRole Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at \nmonth 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of \nimprovement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) \ncompared with those treated with placebo. Galcanezumab was associated with a statistically \nsignificant reduction in disability over placebo. \n \nCompared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had \nsignificantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at month 1 and at \nall subsequent months up to month 6 (see Figure 1). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated with \ngalcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs compared \nwith placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.  \n \n\nFigure 1 Reduction in monthly migraine headache days over time in studies EVOLVE-1 and \nEVOLVE-2 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2.

In patients failing two or more \nprophylactic treatments, the treatment difference was -2.64 days (p < 0.001) between 120 mg and \nplacebo and -3.04 days (p < 0.001) between 240 mg and placebo.  \n \nChronic Migraine \nStudy REGAIN had a 3 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by a \n9 month open-label extension. Approximately 15 % of the patients continued concurrent treatment \nwith topiramate or propranolol as allowed by the protocol for prophylaxis of migraine. Completion \nrate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab was 95.3 %.  \n \nBoth galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see \nTable 3).

In these patients, \nthe treatment difference observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo and between \ngalcanezumab 240 mg and placebo for the reduction of MHDs in these patients was respectively -\n2.53 days (p < 0.001) and -2.26 days (p < 0.001).  \n \nLong term efficacy \nEfficacy was sustained for up to 1 year in an open-label study in which patients with either episodic or \nchronic migraine (with an average baseline of 10.6 monthly MHDs) received galcanezumab \n120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the first month) or galcanezumab \n240 mg/month. 77.8 % of patients completed the treatment period. The overall mean reduction from \nbaseline in the number of monthly MHDs averaged over the treatment phase was 5.6 days for the \n120 mg dose group and 6.5 days for the 240 mg dose group. Over 72 % of patients completing the \nstudy reported a 50 % reduction in MHDs at month 12. In pooled data from studies EVOLVE-1 and \nEVOLVE-2, more than 19 % of the patients treated with galcanezumab maintained a \u2265 50 % response \nfrom Month 1 to Month 6 versus 8 % of the patients on placebo (p < 0.001). \n \nPhase 3 study in a population with previous failure to 2 to 4 migraine preventive medication \ncategories  \nStudy CONQUER, in episodic and chronic migraine patients that experienced previous failures to 2 to \n4 prophylactic medication categories in the past 10 years, supports the main findings of the previous \nmigraine efficacy studies, i.e. galcanezumab treatment led to a mean reduction in monthly migraine \nheadache days (4.1 days compared to 1.0 days in the placebo group; p<.0001).  Mean reduction in \nmonthly migraine headache days was also observed within the subpopulations of episodic migraine \n(2.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 0.3 days for placebo; p<.0001) and chronic migraine \n(5.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 2.2 days for placebo; p<.0001). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ngalcanezumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prophylaxis of migraine \nheadaches (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following a loading dose of 240 mg the \nmaximum serum concentration (Cmax) of galcanezumab was approximately 30 \u03bcg/mL \n(27 % coefficient of variation, (CV)) and the time to Cmax was 5 days postdose.  \n \nMonthly doses of 120 mg or 240 mg achieved a steady-state Cmax (Cmax, ss) of approximately 28 \u03bcg/mL \n(35 % CV) or 54 \u03bcg/mL (31 % CV), respectively. The galcanezumab Cmax, ss at monthly doses of \n120 mg is achieved after the 240 mg loading dose. \n \nInjection site location (abdomen, thigh, buttocks and arm) did not significantly influence the \nabsorption of galcanezumab. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nDistribution \n \nBased on a population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of galcanezumab was 7.3 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAs a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody, galcanezumab is expected to be degraded into small \npeptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. \n \nElimination \n \nBased on a population PK analysis, the apparent clearance of galcanezumab was approximately \n0.008 L/hour and the half life of galcanezumab was 27 days.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nGalcanezumab exposure increases proportionally with dose. \n \nBased on a population PK analysis that included doses ranging from 5 \u2013 300 mg, the rate of \nabsorption, apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution was independent of dose. \n \nAge, sex, weight, race, ethnicity \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed on the basis of age (18 to 65 years), sex, weight, race or ethnicity as \nthere was no clinically meaningful effect of these factors on the apparent clearance or apparent volume \nof distribution of galcanezumab.  \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nSpecific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic \nimpairment on the PK of galcanezumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of IgG \nmonoclonal antibody is low. Similarly, IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via \nintracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence the clearance of \ngalcanezumab. Based on a population PK analysis, bilirubin concentration or Cockcroft-Gault \ncreatinine clearance (range: 24 to 308 mL/min) did not significantly influence the apparent clearance \nof galcanezumab. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazards for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies \nconducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and safety pharmacology evaluations conducted in \ncynomolgus monkeys at exposures approximately 10 to 80 times higher than clinical exposures in \npatients receiving 240 mg. \n \nNonclinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of \ngalcanezumab. There is no evidence to suggest that chronic treatment with galcanezumab would \nincrease the risk of carcinogenesis based on data from pharmacology and chronic toxicology studies \nwith galcanezumab, as well as an assessment of the literature regarding CGRP.  \n \nNo effects on fertility parameters such as oestrous cycle, sperm analysis, or mating and reproductive \nperformance were observed in rats that were administered galcanezumab (exposures approximately 4 \nto 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg). In male fertility study, right testis weight was \nsignificantly reduced at exposures to 4 times the human exposure at 240 mg. \n \nAt Gestational Day 20, an increase in the number of foetuses and litters with short ribs and a decrease \nin the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae occurred in the rat embryo-foetal toxicity \ndevelopment study at an exposure approximately 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg. These \n\n\n\n13 \n\nfindings were noted at no maternal toxicity and were considered to be related to galcanezumab but \nnon-adverse.  \n \nAt Gestational Day 29, in rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study skull anomaly was found in \none male foetus from mother treated with galcanezumab at an exposure approximately 33 times the \nhuman exposure at 240 mg. \n \nIn a juvenile toxicology study in which rats were administered galcanezumab twice weekly from \nPostnatal Day 21 through 90, systemic effects were limited to reversible, minimal, nonadverse \ndecreases in total bone mineral content and bone mineral density at exposures approximately 50 times \nthe human exposure at 240 mg.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEmgality 120 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 120 mg of galcanezumab in 1 mL. \n \nGalcanezumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \ncells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nThe solution is clear and colourless to slightly yellow. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEmgality is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per \nmonth. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 120 mg galcanezumab injected subcutaneously once monthly, with a \n240 mg loading dose as the initial dose. \n \nPatients should be instructed to inject a missed dose as soon as possible and then resume monthly \ndosing. \n \nThe treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further \ndecision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to \ncontinue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter. \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nThere is limited information in subjects aged \u2265 65 years. No dose adjustment is required as the \npharmacokinetics of galcanezumab are not affected by age.   \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nRenal impairment/hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of galcanezumab in children aged 6 to 18 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of galcanezumab in children below the age of 6 years for the prevention of \nmigraine.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nA patient may self-inject galcanezumab by following the Instructions for Use. Galcanezumab is to be \ninjected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, back of the upper arm, or in the gluteal region. After \ntraining, patients may self-inject galcanezumab if a healthcare professional determines that it is \nappropriate. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the Package Leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCardiovascular risk \n \nPatients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see \nsection 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. \n \nSerious hypersensitivity \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions including cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema and urticaria have been \nreported. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of galcanezumab should be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nExcipients  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, i.e., is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo drug interaction studies were conducted. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions are expected based \non the characteristics of galcanezumab.  \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of galcanezumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nHuman immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. As a precautionary measure, it \nis preferable to avoid the use of galcanezumab during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether galcanezumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be excreted \nin breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \nafterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. \nAfterwards, use of galcanezumab could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed.  \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of galcanezumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Fertility studies in animals do \nnot indicate harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGalcanezumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo may \noccur following the administration of galcanezumab (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nOver 2500 patients were exposed to galcanezumab in clinical studies in migraine prophylaxis. Over \n1400 patients were exposed to galcanezumab during the double-blind treatment phase of the placebo-\ncontrolled phase 3 studies. 279  patients were exposed for 12 months. \n \nThe reported adverse drug reactions for 120 mg and 240 mg in the migraine clinical trials were injection \nsite pain (10.1 %/11.6 %),  injection site reactions (9.9 %/14.5 %), vertigo (0.7 %/1.2 %), constipation \n(1.0 %/1.5 %), pruritus (0.7 %/1.2 %) and urticaria (0.3 %/0.1 %). Most of the reactions were mild or \nmoderate in severity. Less than 2.5 % of patients in these studies discontinued due to adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1. List of adverse reactions in clinical studies and post-marketing reports \nFrequency estimate: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylaxis \nAngioedema \n\nEar and Labyrinth \nSystem \n\n Vertigo   \n\nGastrointestinal \nSystem \n\n Constipation   \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneous \nTissue \n\n Pruritus \nRash \n\nUrticaria  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \npain \nInjection site \nreactionsa \n\n   \n\na Most frequently reported terms (\u2265 1 %) were: Injection site reaction, Injection site erythema, \nInjection site pruritus, Injection site bruising, Injection site swelling. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site pain or reactions  \nThe majority of events related to the injection site were mild to moderate and less than 0.5 % of \npatients exposed to galcanezumab during the phase 3 studies discontinued the treatment due to an \ninjection site reaction. The majority of injection site reactions were reported within 1 day and on \naverage resolved within 5 days. In 86 % of the patients reporting injection site pain, the event occurred \nwithin 1 hour of injection and resolved on average in 1 day. One percent of the patients exposed to \ngalcanezumab during the phase 3 studies experienced severe pain at the injection site. \n \nUrticaria \nWhile urticaria is uncommon, serious cases of urticaria have been reported in galcanezumab clinical \nstudies. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the clinical studies, the incidence of anti-drug antibody development during the double-blind \ntreatment phase was 4.8 % in patients receiving galcanezumab once monthly (all but one of whom had \nin vitro neutralizing activity). With 12 months of treatment, up to 12.5 % of galcanezumab-treated \npatients developed anti-drug antibodies, most of which were of low titre and tested positive for \nneutralising activity in vitro. However, the presence of anti-drug antibodies did not affect the \npharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of galcanezumab. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 600 mg have been administered subcutaneously to humans without dose-limiting toxicity. \nIn case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, ATC \ncode: N02CD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nGalcanezumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds calcitonin gene-related peptide \n(CGRP) thus preventing its biological activity. Elevated blood concentrations of CGRP have been \nassociated with migraine attacks. Galcanezumab binds to CGRP with high affinity (KD = 31 pM) and \nhigh specificity (> 10,000-fold vs related peptides adrenomedullin, amylin, calcitonin and intermedin).  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of galcanezumab has been studied in 3 phase 3, randomized, placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind studies in adult patients (N = 2886). The 2 episodic migraine studies \n(EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2) enrolled patients who met International Classification of Headache \nDisorders (ICHD) criteria for a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura with 4-14 migraine \nheadache days per month. The chronic migraine study (REGAIN) enrolled patients who met ICHD \ncriteria for chronic migraine with \u2265 15 headache days per month, of which at least 8 had the features \nof migraine. Patients with recent acute cardiovascular events (including MI, unstable angina, CABG, \nstroke, DVT) and/or those deemed to be at serious cardiovascular risk were excluded from the \ngalcanezumab clinical trials. Patients > 65 years of age were also excluded. \n \nPatients received placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the \nfirst month) or galcanezumab 240 mg/month and were allowed to use medication for the acute \ntreatment of migraine. Across the 3 studies, patients were predominantly female (> 83 %) with a mean \nage of 41 years, and an average migraine history of 20 to 21 years. Approximately one-third of \npatients across the studies had at least 1 prior failure on a migraine prophylactic treatment for efficacy \nreasons and approximately 16 % of patients across the studies had at least 2 prior failure on a \nprophylactic treatment for efficacy reasons. \n \nIn all 3 studies, the overall mean change from baseline in number of monthly Migraine Headache \nDays (MHDs) was the primary efficacy measure. Response rate is the mean percentage of patients \nmeeting a defined threshold in the reduction of the number of monthly MHDs (\u2265 50 %, \u2265 75 % and \n100 %) across the double-blind treatment period. The impact of migraine on functioning was assessed \nby the Role Function-Restrictive domain of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire \n(MSQ) version 2.1, and by the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire. The MSQ \nmeasures impact of migraine on work or daily activities, relationships with family and friends, leisure \ntime, productivity, concentration, energy, and tiredness. Scoring ranges from 0 to 100, with higher \nscores indicating less impairment , that is, patients experience fewer restrictions on the performance of \nday-to-day activities. For the MIDAS, higher scores indicate more disability. The baseline scores of \nthe MIDAS reflected severe migraine related disability of patients in EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 \n(mean of 33.1) and a very severely disabled population (mean of 67.2) in REGAIN.   \n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nEpisodic migraine \nStudies EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 had a 6 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment \nperiod. Completion rate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab \nranged from 82.8 % to 87.7 %.  \n \nBoth galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see \nTable 2). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the \nnumber of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. \nGalcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ \nRole Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at \nmonth 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of \nimprovement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) \ncompared with those treated with placebo. Galcanezumab was associated with a statistically \nsignificant reduction in disability over placebo. \n \nCompared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had \nsignificantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at month 1 and at \nall subsequent months up to month 6 (see Figure 1). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated with \ngalcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs compared \nwith placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.  \n \n\nFigure 1 Reduction in monthly migraine headache days over time in studies EVOLVE-1 and \nEVOLVE-2 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 2.

Approximately 15 % of the patients continued concurrent treatment \nwith topiramate or propranolol as allowed by the protocol for prophylaxis of migraine. Completion \nrate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab was 95.3 %.  \n \nBoth galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see \nTable 3). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the \nnumber of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. \nGalcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ \nRole Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at \nmonth 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of \nimprovement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) \ncompared with those treated with placebo. The 120 mg dose was associated with a statistically \nsignificant reduction in disability over placebo.  \n \nCompared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had \nsignificantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at the first month \nand at all subsequent months up to month 3 (see Figure 2). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated \nwith galcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs \ncompared with placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.  \n \n\nFigure 2 Reduction in monthly migraine headache days over time in study REGAIN \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 3.

In patients failing two or more prophylactic treatments, the treatment difference was -\n4.48 days (p < 0.001) between 120 mg and placebo and -1.86 days (p < 0.01) between 240 mg and \nplacebo. \n \nSixty-four percent of the patients had acute headache medication overuse at baseline. In these patients, \nthe treatment difference observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo and between \ngalcanezumab 240 mg and placebo for the reduction of MHDs in these patients was respectively -\n2.53 days (p < 0.001) and -2.26 days (p < 0.001).  \n \nLong term efficacy \nEfficacy was sustained for up to 1 year in an open-label study in which patients with either episodic or \nchronic migraine (with an average baseline of 10.6 monthly MHDs) received galcanezumab \n120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the first month) or galcanezumab \n240 mg/month. 77.8 % of patients completed the treatment period. The overall mean reduction from \nbaseline in the number of monthly MHDs averaged over the treatment phase was 5.6 days for the \n120 mg dose group and 6.5 days for the 240 mg dose group. Over 72 % of patients completing the \nstudy reported a 50 % reduction in MHDs at month 12. In pooled data from studies EVOLVE-1 and \nEVOLVE-2, more than 19 % of the patients treated with galcanezumab maintained a \u2265 50 % response \nfrom Month 1 to Month 6 versus 8 % of the patients on placebo (p < 0.001). \n \nPhase 3 study in a population with previous failure to 2 to 4 migraine preventive medication \ncategories  \nStudy CONQUER, in episodic and chronic migraine patients that experienced previous failures to 2 to \n4 prophylactic medication categories in the past 10 years, supports the main findings of the previous \nmigraine efficacy studies, i.e. galcanezumab treatment led to a mean reduction in monthly migraine \nheadache days (4.1 days compared to 1.0 days in the placebo group; p<.0001).  Mean reduction in \nmonthly migraine headache days was also observed within the subpopulations of episodic migraine \n(2.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 0.3 days for placebo; p<.0001) and chronic migraine \n(5.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 2.2 days for placebo; p<.0001). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ngalcanezumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prophylaxis of migraine \nheadaches (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following a loading dose of 240 mg the \nmaximum serum concentration (Cmax) of galcanezumab was approximately 30 \u03bcg/mL \n(27 % coefficient of variation, (CV)) and the time to Cmax was 5 days postdose.  \n \nMonthly doses of 120 mg or 240 mg achieved a steady-state Cmax (Cmax, ss) of approximately 28 \u03bcg/mL \n(35 % CV) or 54 \u03bcg/mL (31 % CV), respectively. The galcanezumab Cmax, ss at monthly doses of \n120 mg is achieved after the 240 mg loading dose. \n \nInjection site location (abdomen, thigh, buttocks and arm) did not significantly influence the \nabsorption of galcanezumab. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nDistribution \n \nBased on a population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of galcanezumab was 7.3 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAs a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody, galcanezumab is expected to be degraded into small \npeptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. \n \nElimination \n \nBased on a population PK analysis, the apparent clearance of galcanezumab was approximately \n0.008 L/hour and the half life of galcanezumab was 27 days.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nGalcanezumab exposure increases proportionally with dose. \n \nBased on a population PK analysis that included doses ranging from 5 \u2013 300 mg, the rate of \nabsorption, apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution was independent of dose. \n \nAge, sex, weight, race, ethnicity \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed on the basis of age (18 to 65 years), sex, weight, race or ethnicity as \nthere was no clinically meaningful effect of these factors on the apparent clearance or apparent volume \nof distribution of galcanezumab.  \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nSpecific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic \nimpairment on the PK of galcanezumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of IgG \nmonoclonal antibody is low. Similarly, IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via \nintracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence the clearance of \ngalcanezumab. Based on a population PK analysis, bilirubin concentration or Cockcroft-Gault \ncreatinine clearance (range: 24 to 308 mL/min) did not significantly influence the apparent clearance \nof galcanezumab. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazards for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies \nconducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and safety pharmacology evaluations conducted in \ncynomolgus monkeys at exposures approximately 10 to 80 times higher than clinical exposures in \npatients receiving 240 mg. \n \nNonclinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of \ngalcanezumab. There is no evidence to suggest that chronic treatment with galcanezumab would \nincrease the risk of carcinogenesis based on data from pharmacology and chronic toxicology studies \nwith galcanezumab, as well as an assessment of the literature regarding CGRP.  \n \nNo effects on fertility parameters such as oestrous cycle, sperm analysis, or mating and reproductive \nperformance were observed in rats that were administered galcanezumab (exposures approximately 4 \nto 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg). In male fertility study, right testis weight was \nsignificantly reduced at exposures to 4 times the human exposure at 240 mg. \n \nAt Gestational Day 20, an increase in the number of foetuses and litters with short ribs and a decrease \nin the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae occurred in the rat embryo-foetal toxicity \ndevelopment study at an exposure approximately 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg. These \n\n\n\n26 \n\nfindings were noted at no maternal toxicity and were considered to be related to galcanezumab but \nnon-adverse.  \n \nAt Gestational Day 29, in rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study skull anomaly was found in \none male foetus from mother treated with galcanezumab at an exposure approximately 33 times the \nhuman exposure at 240 mg. \n \nIn a juvenile toxicology study in which rats were administered galcanezumab twice weekly from \nPostnatal Day 21 through 90, systemic effects were limited to reversible, minimal, nonadverse \ndecreases in total bone mineral content and bone mineral density at exposures approximately 50 times \nthe human exposure at 240 mg.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n39 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nEmgality 120 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n\ngalcanezumab \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Emgality is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Emgality  \n3. How to use Emgality  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Emgality  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Emgality is and what it is used for \n \nEmgality contains galcanezumab, a medicine that stops the activity of a naturally occurring substance \nin the body called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). People with migraine may have increased \nlevels of CGRP.  \n \nEmgality is used to prevent migraine in adult patients who have at least 4 migraines days per month.  \n \nEmgality can reduce the frequency of migraine headache and improve your quality of life. It starts \nworking in about a week. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Emgality \n \nDo not use Emgality: \n- if you are allergic to galcanezumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).   \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or during treatment with Emgality if: \n\n- you have a serious cardiovascular disease. Emgality has not been studied in patients with \nserious cardiovascular diseases. \n\n \nLook out for allergic reactions \nEmgality can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. You must look out for signs of these \nreactions while you are using Emgality. Stop using Emgality and tell your doctor or seek medical help \n\n\n\n40 \n\nimmediately if you notice any signs of a serious allergic reaction. Such signs are listed under \u201cSerious \nside effects\u201d in section 4.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not \nbeen studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Emgality  \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are a woman able to have children, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant while using \nEmgality.  \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Emgality in pregnancy as the \neffects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. \nYou and your doctor should decide if you should breast feed and use Emgality .    \n \nDriving and using machines \nGalcanezumab could have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. Some patients \nhave had vertigo whilst using Emgality. \n \nEmgality contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say it is \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use Emgality \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you.
