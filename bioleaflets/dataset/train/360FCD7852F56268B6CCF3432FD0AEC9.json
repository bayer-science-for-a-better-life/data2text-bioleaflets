This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLENVIMA 4 mg hard capsules\nLENVIMA 10 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nLENVIMA 4 mg hard capsules\nEach hard capsule contains 4 mg of lenvatinib (as mesilate)\n\nLENVIMA 10 mg hard capsules\nEach hard capsule contains 10 mg of lenvatinib (as mesilate)\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nLENVIMA 4 mg hard capsules\nA yellowish-red body and yellowish-red cap, approximately 14.3 mm in length, marked in black ink \nwith \u201c\u0404\u201d on the cap, and \u201cLENV 4 mg\u201d on the body.\n\nLENVIMA 10 mg hard capsules\nA yellow body and yellowish-red cap, approximately 14.3 mm in length, marked in black ink with \u201c\u0404\u201d \non the cap, and \u201cLENV 10 mg\u201d on the body.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nLENVIMA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally \nadvanced or metastatic, differentiated (papillary/follicular/H\u00fcrthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC), \nrefractory to radioactive iodine (RAI).\n\nLENVIMA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or \nunresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received no prior systemic therapy (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nLENVIMA treatment should be initiated and supervised by a health care professional experienced in \nthe use of anticancer therapies.\n\nOptimal medical management (i.e. treatment or therapy) for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea should be \ninitiated prior to any lenvatinib therapy interruption or dose reduction; gastrointestinal toxicity should \nbe actively treated in order to reduce the risk of development of renal impairment or failure (see \nsection 4.4, Renal failure and impairment).\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nIf a patient misses a dose, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be skipped and \nthe next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. \n\nTreatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.\n\nDifferentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)\nThe recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 24 mg (two 10 mg capsules and one 4 mg capsule) once \ndaily. The daily dose is to be modified as needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan.\n\nDose adjustments and discontinuations for DTC\nManagement of adverse reactions may require dose interruption, adjustment, or discontinuation of \nlenvatinib therapy (see section 4.4). Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally \ndo not warrant interruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management.\nSevere (e.g., Grade 3) or intolerable adverse reactions require interruption of lenvatinib until \nimprovement of the reaction to Grade 0-1 or baseline.\n\nFor lenvatinib related toxicities (see Table 3), upon resolution/improvement of an adverse reaction to \nGrade 0-1 or baseline, treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose of lenvatinib as suggested in \nTable 1. \n\nTable 1 Dose modifications from recommended lenvatinib daily dose in DTC patientsa\n\nDose level Daily dose Number of capsules\nRecommended daily \ndose\n\n24 mg orally once daily Two 10 mg capsules plus one 4 mg capsule\n\nFirst dose reduction 20 mg orally once daily Two 10 mg capsules\nSecond dose reduction 14 mg orally once daily One 10 mg capsule plus one 4 mg capsule\nThird dose reduction 10 mg orally once dailya One 10 mg capsule\na: Further dose reductions should be considered on an individual patient basis as limited data are \n\navailable for doses below 10 mg.\n\nTreatment should be discontinued in case of life-threatening reactions (e.g., Grade 4) with the \nexception of laboratory abnormality judged to be non-life-threatening, in which case they should be \nmanaged as severe reaction (e.g., Grade 3).\n\nHepatocellular Carcinoma\nThe recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 8 mg (two 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients with a \nbody weight of < 60 kg and 12 mg (three 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients with a body weight of \n\u2265 60 kg. Dose adjustments are based only on toxicities observed and not on body weight changes \nduring treatment. The daily dose is to be modified, as needed, according to the dose/toxicity \nmanagement plan.\n\nDose adjustments and Discontinuation for HCC\nManagement of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption, adjustment, or discontinuation \nof lenvatinib therapy. Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally do not warrant \ninterruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management. Details for \nmonitoring, dose adjustment and discontinuation are provided in Table 2.\n\n\n\n4\n\nTable 2 Dose modifications from recommended lenvatinib daily dose in HCC patients\n\nStarting Dose\n\n\u226560 kg BW\n12 mg (three 4 mg \ncapsules orally once \ndaily)\n\n<60 kg BW \n8 mg (two 4 mg \ncapsules orally \nonce daily)\n\nPersistent and Intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 Toxicitiesa\n\nAdverse Reaction Modification\nAdjusted Doseb\n\n(\u226560 kg BW)\nAdjusted Doseb\n\n(<60 kg BW)\n\nFirst occurrence c\nInterrupt until resolved to \nGrade 0-1 or baselined\n\n8 mg \n(two 4 mg capsules) \norally once daily\n\n4 mg \n(one 4 mg capsule) \norally once daily\n\nSecond occurrence\n(same reaction or \nnew reaction)\n\nInterrupt until resolved to \nGrade 0-1 or baselined\n\n4 mg \n(one 4 mg capsule) \norally once daily\n\n4 mg \n(one 4 mg capsule) \norally every other \nday\n\nThird occurrence\n(same reaction or \nnew reaction)\n\nInterrupt until resolved to \nGrade 0-1 or baselined\n\n4 mg \n(one 4 mg capsule) \norally every other day\n\nDiscontinue\n\nLife-threatening toxicities (Grade 4): Discontinuee\n\na.

All patients other than those with severe hepatic or renal \nimpairment (see below) should initiate treatment at the recommended 24 mg dose, following which \nthe dose should be further adjusted on the basis of individual tolerability.\n\nHCC\nPatients \u226575 years, of white race or female sex or those with worse baseline hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A score of 6 compared to score of 5) appear to have reduced tolerability to lenvatinib. \n\nHCC patients other than those with moderate and severe hepatic impairment or severe renal \nimpairment should initiate treatment at the recommended starting dose of 8 mg (two 4 mg capsules) \nfor body weight < 60 kg and 12 mg (three 4 mg capsules) for body weight \u2265 60 kg, following which \nthe dose should be further adjusted on the basis of individual tolerability.\n\nPatients with hypertension\nBlood pressure should be well controlled prior to treatment with lenvatinib, and should be regularly \nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.4). Refer also to section 4.8, Other special populations.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nDTC\nNo adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of hepatic function in patients with mild \n(Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. In patients with severe (Child-Pugh \nC) hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 14 mg taken once daily. Further dose \n\n\n\n6\n\nadjustments may be necessary on the basis of individual tolerability. Refer also to section 4.8, Other \nspecial populations.\n\nHCC\nIn the patient populations enrolled in the HCC study no dose adjustments were required on the basis of \nhepatic function in those patients who had mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). The available \nvery limited data are not sufficient to allow for a dosing recommendation for HCC patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in \nthese patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Lenvatinib has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic imparement (Child-Pugh C) and is not recommended for use in these patients.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nDTC\nNo adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended starting dose \nis 14 mg taken once daily. Further dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual tolerability.\nPatients with end-stage renal disease were not studied, therefore the use of lenvatinib in these patients \nis not recommended. Refer also to section 4.8, Other special populations.\n\nHCC\nNo dose adjustments are required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or moderate renal \nimpairment. The available data do not allow for a dosing recommendation for patients with HCC and \nsevere renal impairment.\n\nElderly population\nNo adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of age. Limited data are available on use in \npatients aged \u226575 years (see also section 4.8, Other special populations).\n\nPaediatric population\nLenvatinib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns \nidentified in animal studies (see section 5.3). The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in children aged \n2 to <18 years have not yet been established (see section 5.1). No data are available.\n\nRace\nNo adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of race (see section 5.2). Limited data are \navailable on use in patients from ethnic origins other than Caucasian or Asian (see also section 4.8, \nOther special populations).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nLenvatinib is for oral use. The capsules should be taken at about the same time each day, with or \nwithout food (see section 5.2). The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. Caregivers should \nnot open the capsule, in order to avoid repeated exposure to the contents of the capsule.\n\nAlternatively, the lenvatinib capsules may be added without breaking or crushing them to a tablespoon \nof water or apple juice in a small glass to produce a suspension. The capsules must be left in the liquid \nfor at least 10 minutes and stirred for at least 3 minutes to dissolve the capsule shells. The suspension \nis to be swallowed. After drinking, the same amount of water or apple juice (one tablespoon) must be \nadded to the glass and swirled a few times. The additional liquid must be swallowed. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n\n\n\n7\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypertension\n\nHypertension has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in the \ncourse of treatment (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). Blood pressure (BP) \nshould be well controlled prior to treatment with lenvatinib and, if patients are known to be \nhypertensive, they should be on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week prior to \ntreatment with lenvatinib. Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension, including aortic \ndissection, have been reported. The early detection and effective management of hypertension are \nimportant to minimise the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and reductions. Antihypertensive \nagents should be started as soon as elevated BP is confirmed. BP should be monitored after 1 week of \ntreatment with lenvatinib, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and monthly thereafter. The \nchoice of antihypertensive treatment should be individualised to the patient\u2019s clinical circumstances \nand follow standard medical practice. For previously normotensive subjects, monotherapy with one of \nthe classes of antihypertensives should be started when elevated BP is observed. For those patients \nalready on an antihypertensive medicinal product , the dose of the current agent may be increased, if \nappropriate, or one or more agents of a different class of antihypertensive should be added. When \nnecessary, manage hypertension as recommended in Table 4.\n\nTable 4 Recommended management of hypertension\n\nBlood Pressure (BP) level Recommended action\n\nSystolic BP \u2265140 mmHg up to <160 mmHg or \ndiastolic BP \u226590 mmHg up to <100 mmHg \n\nContinue lenvatinib and initiate antihypertensive \ntherapy, if not already receiving\n\nOR\nContinue lenvatinib and increase the dose of the \ncurrent antihypertensive therapy or initiate \nadditional antihypertensive therapy\n\nSystolic BP \u2265160 mmHg or \ndiastolic BP \u2265100 mmHg \ndespite optimal antihypertensive therapy\n\n1. Withhold lenvatinib\n2. When systolic BP \u2264150 mmHg, diastolic BP \n\n\u226495 mmHg, and patient has been on a stable \ndose of antihypertensive therapy for at least \n48 hours, \nresume lenvatinib at a reduced dose (see \nsection 4.2)\n\nLife-threatening consequences\n(malignant hypertension, neurological deficit, or \nhypertensive crisis)\n\nUrgent intervention is indicated. Discontinue \nlenvatinib and institute appropriate medical \nmanagement.\n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating lenvatinib, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm.\n\n\n\n8\n\nProteinuria\n\nProteinuria has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in the course \nof treatment (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). Urine protein should be \nmonitored regularly. If urine dipstick proteinuria \u22652+ is detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or \ndiscontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2). Cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported \nin patients using lenvatinib. Lenvatinib should be discontinued in the event of nephrotic syndrome.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nIn DTC, liver-related adverse reactions most commonly reported in patients treated with lenvatinib \nincluded increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood \nbilirubin. Hepatic failure and acute hepatitis (<1%; see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse \nreactions) have been reported in patients with DTC treated with lenvatinib. The hepatic failure cases \nwere generally reported in patients with progressive metastatic liver metastases disease.\n\nIn HCC patients treated with lenvatinib in the REFLECT trial, liver-related adverse reactions \nincluding hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure (including fatal reactions) were reported at a \nhigher frequency (see Section 4.8) compared to patients treated with sorafenib . Patients with worse \nhepatic impairment and/or greater liver tumour burden at baseline had a higher risk of developing \nhepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure. Hepatic encephalopathy also occurred more frequently in \npatients aged 75 years and older. Approximately half of the events of hepatic failure and one third of \nthe events of the hepatic encephalopathy were reported in patients with disease progression.\n\nData in HCC patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) are very limited and there are \ncurrently no data available in HCC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Since \nlenvatinib is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism, an increase in exposure in patients with \nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment is expected.\n\nClose monitoring of the overall safety is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2). Liver function tests should be monitored before initiation \nof treatment, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter during treatment.\nPatients with HCC should be monitored for worsening liver function including hepatic \nencephalopathy. In the case of hepatotoxicity, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may \nbe necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal failure and impairment\n\nRenal impairment and renal failure have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see \nsection 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). The primary risk factor identified was \ndehydration and/or hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Gastrointestinal toxicity should be \nactively managed in order to reduce the risk of development of renal impairment or renal failure. Dose \ninterruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nIf patients have severe renal impairment, the initial dose of lenvatinib should be adjusted (see sections \n4.2 and 5.2).\n\nDiarrhoea\n\nDiarrhoea has been reported frequently in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in \nthe course of treatment (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). Prompt medical \nmanagement of diarrhoea should be instituted in order to prevent dehydration. Lenvatinib should be \ndiscontinued in the event of persistence of Grade 4 diarrhoea despite medical management.\n\n\n\n9\n\nCardiac dysfunction\n\nCardiac failure (<1%) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported in patients \ntreated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). Patients should be \nmonitored for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac decompensation, as dose interruptions, \nadjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy \nsyndrome (RPLS)\n\nPRES, also known as RPLS, has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (<1%; see \nsection 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions). PRES is a neurological disorder which can \npresent with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other \nvisual or neurological disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance \nimaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES. Appropriate measures should be taken to \ncontrol blood pressure (see section 4.4, Hypertension). In patients with signs or symptoms of PRES, \ndose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nArterial thromboembolisms\n\nArterial thromboembolisms (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, and myocardial \ninfarction) have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8, Description of \nselected adverse reactions). Lenvatinib has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial \nthromboembolism within the previous 6 months, and therefore should be used with caution in such \npatients. A treatment decision should be made based upon an assessment of the individual patient's \nbenefit/risk. Lenvatinib should be discontinued following an arterial thrombotic event.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking lenvatinib and \nfor one month after stopping treatment (see section 4.6). It is currently unknown if lenvatinib increases \nthe risk of thromboembolic events when combined with oral contraceptives.\n\nHaemorrhage\n\nSerious tumour related bleeds, including fatal haemorrhagic events have occurred in clinical trials and \nhave been reported in post-marketing experience (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse \nreactions). In post-marketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery haemorrhages were seen \nmore frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in DTC or other tumour \ntypes. The degree of tumour invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be \nconsidered because of the potential risk of severe haemorrhage associated with tumour \nshrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy. Some cases of bleeding have occurred secondarily to \ntumour shrinkage and fistula formation, e.g. tracheo-oesophageal fistulae. Cases of fatal intracranial \nhaemorrhage have been reported in some patients with or without brain metastases. Bleeding in sites \nother than the brain (e.g. trachea, intra-abdominal, lung) has also been reported. One fatal case of \nhepatic tumour haemorrhage in a patient with HCC has been reported.\n\nScreening for and subsequent treatment of oesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis should \nbe performed as per standard of care before starting treatment with lenvatinib\n\nIn the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be required (see \nSection 4.2, Table 3).\n\n\n\n10\n\nGastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation\n\nGastrointestinal perforation or fistulae have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see \nsection 4.8). In most cases, gastrointestinal perforation and fistulae occurred in patients with risk \nfactors such as prior surgery or radiotherapy. In the case of a gastrointestinal perforation or fistula, \ndose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nNon-gastrointestinal fistula\n\nPatients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with lenvatinib. Cases \nof fistula formation or enlargement that involve areas of the body other than stomach or intestines \nwere observed in clinical trials and in post-marketing experience (e.g. tracheal, tracheo-oesophageal, \noesophageal, cutaneous, female genital tract fistulae). In addition, pneumothorax has been reported \nwith and without clear evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Some reports of fistula and pneumothorax \noccurred in association with tumour regression or necrosis. Prior surgery and radiotherapy may be \ncontributing risk factors. Lung metastases may also increase the risk of pneumothorax. Lenvatinib \nshould not be started in patients with fistula to avoid worsening and lenvatinib should be permanently \ndiscontinued in patients with oesophageal or tracheobronchial tract involvement and any Grade 4 \nfistula (see section 4.2); limited information is available on the use of dose interruption or reduction in \nmanagement of other events, but worsening was observed in some cases and caution should be taken. \nLenvatinib may adversely affect the wound healing process as for other agents of the same class.\n\nQT interval prolongation \n\nQT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported at a higher incidence in patients treated with \nlenvatinib than in patients treated with placebo (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse \nreactions). Electrocardiograms should be monitored at baseline and periodically during treatment in all \npatients with particular attention to those with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, \nbradyarrhythmias, and those taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, including \nClass Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Lenvatinib should be withheld in the event of development of QT \ninterval prolongation greater than 500 ms. Lenvatinib should be resumed at a reduced dose when QTc \nprolongation is resolved to < 480 ms or baseline.\n\nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesaemia increase the risk \nof QT prolongation; therefore, electrolyte abnormalities should be monitored and corrected in all \npatients before starting treatment. Electrolytes (magnesium, potassium and calcium) should be \nmonitored periodically during treatment. Blood calcium levels should be monitored at least monthly \nand calcium should be replaced as necessary during lenvatinib treatment. Lenvatinib dose should be \ninterrupted or dose adjusted as necessary depending on severity, presence of ECG changes, and \npersistence of hypocalcaemia.\n\nImpairment of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression/ Thyroid dysfunction\n\nHypothyroidism has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8, Description of \nselected adverse reactions). Thyroid function should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically \nthroughout, treatment with lenvatinib. Hypothyroidism should be treated according to standard \nmedical practice to maintain euthyroid state.\n\nLenvatinib impairs exogenous thyroid suppression (see section 4.8, Description of selected adverse \nreactions). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be monitored on a regular basis and \nthyroid hormone administration should be adjusted to reach appropriate TSH levels, according to the \npatient\u2019s therapeutic target.\n\n\n\n11\n\nWound Healing Complications\nNo formal studies of the effect of lenvatinib on wound healing have been conducted. Impaired wound \nhealing has been reported in patients receiving lenvatinib. Temporary interruption of lenvatinib should \nbe considered in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience \nregarding the timing of reinitiation of lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure. Therefore, the \ndecision to resume lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure should be based on clinical \njudgment of adequate wound healing.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nLimited data are available for patients of ethnic origin other than Caucasian or Asian, and in patients \naged \u226575 years. Lenvatinib should be used with caution in such patients, given the reduced tolerability \nof lenvatinib in Asian and elderly patients (see section 4.8, Other special populations).\n\nThere are no data on the use of lenvatinib immediately following sorafenib or other anticancer \ntreatments and there may be a potential risk for additive toxicities unless there is an adequate washout \nperiod between treatments. The minimal washout period in clinical trials was 4 weeks.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on lenvatinib\n\nChemotherapeutic agents\n\nConcomitant administration of lenvatinib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has no significant impact on the \npharmacokinetics of any of these 3 substances.\n\nEffect of lenvatinib on other medicinal products\n\nA clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of \nmidazolam (a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in the presence of lenvatinib. No \nsignificant drug-drug interaction is therefore expected between lenvatinib and other CYP3A4/Pgp \nsubstrates.\n\nOral contraceptives\nIt is currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, \nand therefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see section \n4.6).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly effective \ncontraception while on treatment with lenvatinib and for at least one month after finishing treatment. It \nis currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and \ntherefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data on the use of lenvatinib in pregnant women. Lenvatinib was embryotoxic and \nteratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits (see section 5.3).\n\nLenvatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after a careful \nconsideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus.\n\n\n\n12\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk. Lenvatinib and its metabolites are \nexcreted in rat milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns or infants cannot be excluded and, therefore, \nlenvatinib is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\n\nEffects in humans are unknown. However, testicular and ovarian toxicity has been observed in rats, \ndogs, and monkeys (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLenvatinib has  minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, due to undesirable effects \nsuch as fatigue and dizziness.

The \nadverse reactions presented in this section are based on safety data of both DTC and HCC patients (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nDTC\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (occurring in \u226530% of patients) are hypertension \n(68.6%), diarrhoea (62.8%), decreased appetite (51.5%), decreased weight (49.1%), fatigue (45.8%), \nnausea (44.5%), proteinuria 36.9%), stomatitis (35.8%), vomiting (34.5%), dysphonia (34.1%), \nheadache (34.1%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPE) (32.7%). Hypertension \nand proteinuria tend to occur early during lenvatinib treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8, Description of \nselected adverse reactions). The majority of Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions occurred during the first \n6 months of treatment except for diarrhoea, which occurred throughout treatment, and weight loss, \nwhich tended to be cumulative over time.\n\nThe most important serious adverse reactions were renal failure and impairment (2.4%),\narterial thromboembolisms (3.9%), cardiac failure (0.7%), intracranial tumour haemorrhage (0.7%), \nPRES / RPLS (0.2%), hepatic failure (0.2%), and arterial thromboembolisms (cerebrovascular \naccident (1.1%), transient ischaemic attack (0.7%), and myocardial infarction (0.9%).\n\nIn 452 patients with RAI-refractory DTC, dose reduction and discontinuation were the actions taken \nfor an adverse reaction in 63.1% and 19.5% of patients, respectively. Adverse reactions that most \ncommonly led to dose reductions (in \u22655% of patients) were hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhoea, \nfatigue, PPE, decreased weight, and decreased appetite. Adverse reactions that most commonly led to \ndiscontinuation of lenvatinib were proteinuria, asthenia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, \ndiarrhoea, and pulmonary embolism.\n\nHCC\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (occurring in \u226530% of patients) are hypertension \n(44.0%), diarrhoea (38.1%), decreased appetite (34.9%), fatigue (30.6%), and decreased weight \n(30.4%).\n\n\n\n13\n\nThe most important serious adverse reactions were hepatic failure (2.8%), hepatic encephalopathy \n(4.6%), oesophageal varices haemorrhage (1.4%), cerebral haemorrhage (0.6%), arterial \nthromboembolic events (2.0%) including myocardial infarction (0.8%), cerebral infarction (0.4%) and \ncerebrovascular accident (0.4%) and renal failure/impairment events (1.4%). There was a higher \nincidence of decreased neutrophil count in patients with HCC (8.7% on lenvatinib than in other non-\nHCC tumour types (1.4%)), which was not associated with infection, sepsis or bacterial peritonitis.\n\nIn 496 patients with HCC, dose modification (interruption or reduction) and discontinuation were the \nactions taken for an adverse reaction in 62.3% and 20.2% of patients, respectively. Adverse reactions \nthat most commonly led to dose modifications (in \u22655% of patients) were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, \nproteinuria, hypertension, fatigue, PPE and decreased platelet count. Adverse reactions that most \ncommonly led to discontinuation of lenvatinib were hepatic encephalopathy, fatigue, increased blood \nbilirubin, proteinuria and hepatic failure.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nSimilar adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials in DTC and HCC. \nAdverse reactions observed in clinical trials in DTC and HCC and reported from post-marketing use \nof lenvatinib are listed in Table 5. The adverse reaction frequency category represents the most \nconservative estimate of frequency from the two individual populations.\n\nFrequencies are defined as:\n\uf0b7 Very common (\u22651/10)\n\uf0b7 Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10)\n\uf0b7 Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100)\n\uf0b7 Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nWithin each frequency category, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 5 Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with lenvatinib\n\nSystem Organ \nClass\n(MedDRA \nterminology*)\n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nInfections and \ninfestation\n\nUrinary tract \ninfection\n\nPerineal abscess \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \ndisorders\n\nThrombocytopeniaa\n\nLeukopeniaa\n\nNeutropeniaa\n\nLymphopeniaa Splenic infarction\n\nEndocrine \ndisorders\n\nHypothyroidism Increased blood \nthyroid stimulating \n\nhormone \u2021\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nHypocalcaemia\u2021\nHypokalaemia \n\nDecreased weight \nDecreased appetite\n\nDehydration\nHypomagnesaemiab\n\nHypercholesterolaemia\nb\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nInsomnia\n\n\n\n14\n\nTable 5 Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with lenvatinib\n\nSystem Organ \nClass\n(MedDRA \nterminology*)\n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nDizziness\nHeadache\nDysgeusia\n\nCerebrovascular \naccident \u2020\n\nPosterior \nreversible \n\nencephalopathy \nsyndrome \n\nMonoparesis\nTransient \n\nischaemic attack\n\nCardiac \ndisorders\n\nMyocardial \ninfarctionc,\u2020\n\nCardiac failure\nProlonged \n\nelectrocardiogram QT \nDecreased ejection \n\nfraction \n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nHaemorrhaged, \u2020,\u2021\n\nHypertensione,\u2021\n\nHypotension\n\nAneurysms \nand artery \ndissections\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDysphonia Pulmonary embolism\u2020, Pneumothorax\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nDiarrhoea\nGastrointestinal and \n\nabdominal painsf\n\nVomiting\nNausea\n\nOral inflammationg\n\nOral painh\n\nConstipation\nDyspepsia\nDry mouth\n\nAnal fistula\nFlatulence\n\nIncreased lipase \nIncreased amylase \n\nPancreatitis i,\u2020\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nIncreased blood \nbilirubin j, \u2021\n\nHypoalbuminaemiaj\n, \u2021 \n\nIncreased alanine \naminotransferase \u2021\n\nIncreased aspartate \naminotransferase \u2021\n\nHepatic failurek,\u2021,\u2020\n\nHepatic \nencephalopathyl,\u2021,\u2020\n\nIncreased blood \nalkaline phosphatase \n\nHepatic function \nabnormal\n\nIncreased gamma-\nglutamyltransferase \n\nCholecystitis\n\nHepatocellular \ndamage/hepatitis\n\nm\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nPalmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia \n\nsyndrome\nRash\n\nAlopecia\n\nHyperkeratosis\n\n\n\n15\n\nTable 5 Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with lenvatinib\n\nSystem Organ \nClass\n(MedDRA \nterminology*)\n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Not known\n\nMusculoskeleta\nl and \nconnective \ntissue disorders\n\nBack pain\nArthralgia\nMyalgia\n\nPain in extremity\nMusculoskeletal \n\npain\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nProteinuria\u2021 Renal failure cases n, \u2020\n\nRenal impairment\nIncreased blood \n\ncreatinine \nIncreased blood urea \n\nNephrotic \nsyndrome\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nFatigue\nAsthenia\n\nPeripheral oedema \n\nMalaise Impaired healing* Non-\ngastrointestina\n\nl fistulao\n\n* Identified from post-marketing use of lenvatinib\n\u2020: Includes cases with a fatal outcome.\n\u2021: See section 4.8 Description of selected adverse reactions for further characterisation.\nThe following terms have been combined:\na: Thrombocytopenia includes thrombocytopenia and decreased platelet count.

The median \ntime to onset in lenvatinib-treated patients was 16 days. Reactions of Grade 3 or higher (including \n1 reaction of Grade 4) occurred in 44.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients compared with 3.8% of \nplacebo-treated patients. The majority of cases recovered or resolved following dose interruption or \nreduction, which occurred in 13.0% and 13.4% of patients, respectively. In 1.1% of patients, \nhypertension led to permanent treatment discontinuation.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 -REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), hypertension (including hypertension, increased \nblood pressure, increased diastolic blood pressure and orthostatic hypertension) was reported in 44.5% \nof lenvatinib-treated patients and Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 23.5%. The median time to onset \nwas 26 days. The majority of cases recovered following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred \nin 3.6% and 3.4% of patients respectively. One subject (0.2%) discontinued lenvatinib due to \nhypertension.\n\nProteinuria (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), proteinuria was reported in 33.7% of lenvatinib-\ntreated patients and 3.1% of patients in the placebo-treated group. The median time to onset was \n6.7 weeks. Grade 3 reactions occurred in 10.7% of lenvatinib-treated patients and none in placebo-\ntreated patients. The majority of cases had an outcome of recovered or resolved following dose \ninterruption or reduction, which occurred in 16.9% and 10.7% of patients, respectively. Proteinuria led \nto permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.8% of patients.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), proteinuria was reported in 26.3% of lenvatinib-\ntreated patients and Grade 3 reactions occurred in 5.9%. The median time to onset was 6.1 weeks. The \nmajority of cases recovered following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 6.9% and \n2.5% of patients respectively. Proteinuria led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.6% of \npatients.\n\nRenal failure and impairment (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), 5.0% of patients developed renal failure and \n1.9% developed renal impairment (3.1% of patients had a Grade \u2265 3 event of renal failure or \n\n\n\n17\n\nimpairment). In the placebo group 0.8% of patients developed renal failure or impairment (0.8% were \nGrade \u2265 3).\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), 7.1% of lenvatinib-treated patients developed a renal \nfailure/impairment event. Grade 3 or greater reactions occurred in 1.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients.\n\nCardiac dysfunction (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), decreased ejection fraction/cardiac failure was \nreported in 6.5% of patients (1.5% were Grade \u2265 3) in the lenvatinib treated group, and 2.3% in the \nplacebo group (none were Grade \u2265 3).\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), cardiac dysfunction (including congestive cardiac \nfailure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiopulmonary failure) was reported in 0.6% of patients (0.4% were \nGrade \u2265 3) in the lenvatinib-treated group.\n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy \nsyndrome (RPLS) (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), there was 1 event of PRES (Grade 2) in the \nlenvatinib-treated group and no reports in the placebo group.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), there was 1 event of PRES (Grade 2) in the \nlenvatinib-treated group.\n\nAmongst 1,823 patients treated with lenvatinib monotherapy in clinical trials, there were 5 cases \n(0.3%) of PRES (0.2% were Grade 3 or 4), all of which resolved after treatment and/or dose \ninterruption, or permanent discontinuation.\n\nHepatotoxicity (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), the most commonly reported liver-related \nadverse reactions were hypoalbuminaemia (9.6% lenvatinib vs. 1.5% placebo) and elevations of liver \nenzyme levels, including increases in alanine aminotransferase (7.7% lenvatinib vs. 0 placebo), \naspartate aminotransferase (6.9% lenvatinib vs. 1.5% placebo), and blood bilirubin (1.9% lenvatinib \nvs. 0 placebo). The median time to onset of liver reactions in lenvatinib-treated patients was \n12.1 weeks. Liver-related reactions of Grade 3 or higher (including 1 Grade 5 case of hepatic failure) \noccurred in 5.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients compared with 0.8% in placebo-treated patients. Liver-\nrelated reactions led to dose interruptions and reductions in 4.6% and 2.7% of patients, respectively, \nand to permanent discontinuation in 0.4%.\n\nAmongst 1,166 patients treated with lenvatinib, there were 3 cases (0.3%) of hepatic failure, all with a \nfatal outcome. One occurred in a patient with no liver metastases. There was also a case of acute \nhepatitis in a patient without liver metastases.\n\n\n\n18\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), the most commonly reported hepatotoxicity adverse \nreactions were increased blood bilirubin (14.9%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (13.7%), \nincreased alanine aminotransferase (11.1%), hypoalbuminaemia (9.2%), hepatic encephalopathy \n(8.0%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (7.8%) and increased blood alkaline phosphatase \n(6.7%). The median time to onset of hepatotoxocity adverse reactions was 6.4 weeks. Hepatotoxicity \nreactions of \u2265 Grade 3 occurred in 26.1% of lenvatinib-treated patients. Hepatic failure (including fatal \nevents in 12 patients) occurred in 3.6% of patients (all were \u2265 Grade 3). Hepatic encephalopathy \n(including fatal events in 4 patients) occurred in 8.4% of patients (5.5% were \u2265 Grade 3). There were \n17 (3.6%) deaths due to hepatotoxicity events in the lenvatinib arm and 4 (0.8%) deaths in the \nsorafenib arm. Hepatotoxicity adverse reactions led to dose interruptions and reductions in 12.2% and \n7.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients respectively, and to permanent discontinuation in 5.5%.\n\nAcross clinical trials in which 1327 patients received lenvatinib monotherapy in indications other than \nHCC, hepatic failure (including fatal events) was reported in 4 patients (0.3%), liver injury in \n2 patients (0.2%), acute hepatitis in 2 patients (0.2%), and hepatocellular injury in 1 patient (0.1%).\n\nArterial thromboembolisms (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), arterial thromboembolic events were reported in \n5.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 2.3% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2.3% \nof patients treated with lenvatinib. \n\nAmongst 1,823 patients treated with lenvatinib monotherapy in clinical trials, there were 10 cases \n(0.5%) of arterial thromboembolisms (5 cases of myocardial infarction and 5 cases of cerebrovascular \naccident) with a fatal outcome.\n\nHaemorrhage (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), haemorrhage was reported in 34.9% (1.9% were \nGrade \u2265 3) of lenvatinib-treated patients versus 18.3% (3.1% were Grade \u2265 3) of placebo-treated \npatients.

No differences between \nlenvatinib- and placebo-treated patients were observed in the incidences of serious reactions (3.4% vs. \n3.8%), reactions leading to premature discontinuation (1.1% vs. 1.5%), or reactions leading to dose \ninterruption (3.4% vs. 3.8%) or reduction (0.4% vs. 0).\n\n\n\n19\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), haemorrhage was reported in 24.6% of patients and \n5.0% were Grade \u2265 3. Grade 3 reactions occurred in 3.4%, Grade 4 reactions in 0.2% and 7 patients \n(1.5%) had a grade 5 reaction including cerebral haemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, \nintestinal haemorrhage and tumour haemorrhage. The median time to first onset was 11.9 weeks. A \nhaemorrhage event led to dose interruption or reduction in 3.2% and 0.8% patients respectively and to \ntreatment discontinuation in 1.7% of patients.\n\nAcross clinical trials in which 1,327 patients received lenvatinib monotherapy in indications other than \nHCC, Grade \u2265 3 or greater haemorrhage was reported in 2% of patients, 3 patients (0.2%) had a \nGrade 4 haemorrhage and 8 patients (0.6%) had a Grade 5 reaction including arterial haemorrhage, \nhaemorrhagic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial tumour haemorrhage, haematemesis, \nmelaena, haemoptysis and tumour haemorrhage. \n\nHypocalcaemia (see section 4.4, QT interval prolongation)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), hypocalcaemia was reported in 12.6% of \nlenvatinib-treated patients vs. no cases in the placebo arm. The median time to first onset in lenvatinib-\ntreated patients was 11.1 weeks. Reactions of Grade 3 or 4 severity occurred in 5.0% of lenvatinib-\ntreated vs 0 placebo-treated patients. Most reactions resolved following supportive treatment, without \ndose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 1.5% and 1.1% of patients, respectively; 1 patient \nwith Grade 4 hypocalcaemia discontinued treatment permanently.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), hypocalcaemia was reported in 1.1% of patients, with \ngrade 3 reactions occurring in 0.4%. Lenvatinib dose interruption due to hypocalcaemia occurred in \none subject (0.2%) and there were no dose reductions or discontinuations.\n\nGastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), events of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula \nwere reported in 1.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 0.8% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), events of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula were \nreported in 1.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients.\n\nNon-Gastrointestinal fistulae (see section 4.4)\nLenvatinib use has been associated with cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in death. \nReports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than stomach or intestines were observed \nacross various indications. Reactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging \nfrom two weeks to greater than 1 year from initiation of lenvatinib, with median latency of about \n3 months.\n\n\n\n20\n\nQT interval prolongation (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), QT/QTc interval prolongation was reported in \n8.8% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of QT \ninterval prolongation of greater than 500 ms was 2% in the lenvatinib-treated patients compared to no \nreports in the placebo group.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), QT/QTc interval prolongation was reported in 6.9% \nof lenvatinib-treated patients. The incidence of QTcF interval prolongation of greater than 500ms was \n2.4%.\n\nIncreased blood thyroid stimulating hormone (see section 4.4 Impairment of thyroid stimulating \nhormone suppression / Thyroid dysfunction)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), 88% of all patients had a baseline TSH level \nless than or equal to 0.5 mU/L. In those patients with a normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level \nabove 0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of lenvatinib-treated patients as compared with \n14% of placebo-treated patients.\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), 89.6% of patients had a baseline TSH level of less \nthan the upper limit of normal. Elevation of TSH above the upper limit of normal was observed post \nbaseline in 69.6% of lenvatinib-treated patients. \n\nDiarrhoea (see section 4.4)\n\nDTC\n\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was reported in 67.4% of patients in \nthe lenvatinib-treated group (9.2% were Grade \u2265 3) and in 16.8% of patients in the placebo group \n(none were Grade \u2265 3).\n\nHCC\n\nIn the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was reported in 38.7% of patients treated \nwith lenvatinib (4.2% were Grade \u2265 3).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical data are not available in this population (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n21\n\nOther special populations\n\nElderly\n\nDTC\n\nPatients of age \u226575 years were more likely to experience Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, proteinuria, \ndecreased appetite, and dehydration. \n\nHCC\n\nPatients of age \u226575 years were more likely to experience hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, \nasthenia, dehydration, dizziness, malaise, peripheral oedema, pruritus and hepatic encephalopathy.\nHepatic encephalopathy occurred at more than twice the incidence in patients aged \u226575 years (17.2%) \nthan in those <75 years (7.1%). Hepatic encephalopathy tended to be associated with adverse disease \ncharacteristics at baseline or with the use of concomitant medicinal products . Arterial \nthromboembolic events also occurred at an increased incidence in this age group.\n\nGender\n\nDTC\n\nFemales had a higher incidence of hypertension (including Grade 3 or 4 hypertension), proteinuria, \nand PPE, while males had a higher incidence of decreased ejection fraction and gastrointestinal \nperforation and fistula formation.\n\nHCC\n\nFemales had a higher incidence of hypertension, fatigue, ECG QT prolongation and alopecia. Men had \na higher incidence (26.5%) of dysphonia than women (12.3%), decreased weight and decreased \nplatelet count. Hepatic failure events were observed in male patients only.\n\nEthnic origin\n\nDTC\n\nAsian patients had a higher incidence than Caucasian patients of peripheral oedema, hypertension, \nfatigue, PPE, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and increased blood thyroid stimulating hormone.\n\nHCC\n\nAsian patients had a higher incidence than Caucasian patients of proteinuria, decreased neutrophil \ncount, decreased platelet count, decreased white blood count and PPE syndrome, while Caucasian \npatients had a higher incidence of fatigue, hepatic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, anxiety, \nasthenia, nausea, thrombocytopenia and vomiting.\n\nBaseline hypertension\n\nDTC\n\nPatients with baseline hypertension had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, proteinuria, \ndiarrhoea, and dehydration, and experienced more serious cases of dehydration, hypotension, \npulmonary embolism, malignant pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, and GI symptoms (abdominal \npain, diarrhoea, vomiting).\n\n\n\n22\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nDTC\n\nPatients with baseline hepatic impairment had a higher incidence of hypertension and PPE, and a \nhigher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, asthenia, fatigue, and hypocalcaemia compared with \npatients with normal hepatic function. \n\nHCC\n\nPatients with a baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score of 6 (about 20% patients in the REFLECT study) had a \nhigher incidence of decreased appetite, fatigue, proteinuria, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure \ncompared to patients with a baseline CP score of 5. Hepatotoxicity events and haemorrhage events \nalso occurred at a higher incidence in CP score 6 patients compared to CP score 5 patients.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nDTC\n\nPatients with baseline renal impairment had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, \nproteinuria, fatigue, stomatitis, oedema peripheral, thrombocytopenia, dehydration, prolonged QT, \nhypothyroidism, hyponatraemia, increased blood thyroid stimulating hormone, pneumonia compared \nwith subjects with normal renal function. These patients also had a higher incidence of renal reactions \nand a trend towards a higher incidence of liver reactions.\n\nHCC\n\nPatients with baseline renal impairment had a higher incidence of fatigue, hypothyroidism, \ndehydration, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, proteinuria and hepatic encephalopathy. These patients \nalso had a higher incidence of renal reactions and arterial thromboembolic events.\n\nPatients with body weight <60 kg\n\nDTC\n\nPatients with low body weight (<60 kg) had a higher incidence of PPE, proteinuria, of Grade 3 or 4 \nhypocalcaemia and hyponatraemia, and a trend towards a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nappetite.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe highest doses of lenvatinib studied clinically were 32 mg and 40 mg per day. Accidental \nmedication errors resulting in single doses of 40 to 48 mg have occurred in clinical trials. The most \nfrequently observed adverse drug reactions at these doses were hypertension, nausea, diarrhoea, \nfatigue, stomatitis, proteinuria, headache, and aggravation of PPE. There have also been reports of \noverdose with lenvatinib involving single administrations of 6 to 10 times the recommended daily \ndose. These cases were associated with adverse reactions consistent with the known safety profile of \nlenvatinib (i.e., renal and cardiac failure), or were without adverse reactions.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23\n\nSymptoms and Management\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with lenvatinib. In case of suspected overdose, lenvatinib \nshould be withheld and appropriate supportive care given as required.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE29\n\nLenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor which has shown mainly antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in \nvivo, and direct inhibition of tumour growth was also observed in in vitro models.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nLenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of \nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and \nVEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including \nfibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor \n(PDGF) receptor PDGFR\u03b1, KIT, and RET.\n\nIn addition, lenvatinib had selective, direct antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular cell lines \ndependent on activated FGFR signalling, which is attributed to the inhibition of FGFR signalling by \nlenvatinib.\n\nAlthough not studied directly with lenvatinib, the mechanism of action (MOA) for hypertension is \npostulated to be mediated by the inhibition of VEGFR2 in vascular endothelial cells. Similarly, \nalthough not studied directly, the MOA for proteinuria is postulated to be mediated by downregulation \nof VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in the podocytes of the glomerulus.\n\nThe mechanism of action for hypothyroidism is not fully elucidated.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nRadioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer\nThe SELECT study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was \nconducted in 392 patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer with independent, \ncentrally reviewed, radiographic evidence of disease progression within 12 months (+1 month \nwindow) prior to enrolment. Radioiodine-refractory was defined as one or more measurable lesions \neither with a lack of iodine uptake or with progression in spite of radioactive-iodine (RAI) therapy, or \nhaving a cumulative activity of RAI of >600 mCi or 22 GBq with the last dose at least 6 months prior \nto study entry. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region (Europe, North America, and \nOther), prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy (patients may have received 0 or 1 prior \nVEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy), and age (\u226465 years or >65 years). The main efficacy outcome \nmeasure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by blinded independent radiologic review \nusing Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome \nmeasures included overall response rate and overall survival. Patients in the placebo arm could opt to \nreceive lenvatinib treatment at the time of confirmed disease progression.\n\nEligible patients with measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 were randomised 2:1 to receive \nlenvatinib 24 mg once daily (n=261) or placebo (n=131). Baseline demographics and disease \ncharacteristics were well balanced for both treatment groups. Of the 392 patients randomised, 76.3% \nwere na\u00efve to prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies, 49.0% were female, 49.7% were European, and \nthe median age was 63 years. Histologically, 66.1% had a confirmed diagnosis of papillary thyroid \ncancer and 33.9% had follicular thyroid cancer which included H\u00fcrthle cell 14.8% and clear cell 3.8%.\nMetastases were present in 99% of the patients: lungs in 89.3%, lymph nodes in 51.5%, bone in \n\n\n\n24\n\n38.8%, liver in 18.1%, pleura in 16.3%, and brain in 4.1%. The majority of patients had an ECOG \nperformance status of 0; 42.1% had a status of 1; 3.9% had a status above 1. The median cumulative \nRAI activity administered prior to study entry was 350 mCi (12.95 GBq).\n\nA statistically significant prolongation in PFS was demonstrated in lenvatinib-treated patients \ncompared with those receiving placebo (p<0.0001) (see figure 1). The positive effect on PFS was seen \nacross the subgroups of age (above or below 65 years), sex, race, histological subtype, geographic \nregion, and those who received 0 or 1 prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies. Following independent \nreview confirmation of disease progression, 109 (83.2%) patients randomised to placebo had crossed \nover to open-label lenvatinib at the time of the primary efficacy analysis.\n\nThe objective response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) per independent \nradiological review was significantly (p<0.0001) higher in the lenvatinib-treated group (64.8%) than in \nthe placebo-treated group (1.5%). Four (1.5%) subjects treated with lenvatinib attained a CR and 165 \nsubjects (63.2%) had a PR, while no subjects treated with placebo had a CR and 2 (1.5%) subjects had \na PR.\n\nThe median time to first dose reduction was 2.8 months. The median time to objective responsive was \n2.0 (95% CI: 1.9, 3.5) months; however, of the patients who experienced a complete or partial \nresponse to lenvatinib, 70.4% were observed to develop the response on or within 30 days of being on \nthe 24-mg dose.\n\nThe overall survival analysis was confounded by the fact that placebo-treated subjects with confirmed \ndisease progression had the option to cross over to open-label lenvatinib. There was no statistically \nsignificant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups at the time of the primary \nefficacy analysis (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.07, p=0.1032). The median Overall Survival (OS) had \nnot been reached for either the lenvatinib group or the placebo crossover group.\n\nTable 6 Efficacy results in DTC patients\n\nLenvatinib\nN=261\n\nPlacebo\nN=131\n\nProgression-Free Survival (PFS)a\n\nNumber of progressions or deaths (%) 107 (41.0) 113 (86.3)\nMedian PFS in months (95% CI) 18.3 (15.1, NE) 3.6 (2.2, 3.7)\nHazard ratio (99% CI)b,c 0.21 (0.14, 0.31)\nP-valueb <0.0001\n\nPatients who had received 0 prior \nVEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy (%)\n\n195 (74.7) 104 (79.4)\n\nNumber of progressions or deaths 76 88\nMedian PFS in months (95% CI) 18.7 (16.4, NE) 3.6 (2.1, 5.3)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b,c 0.20 (0.14, 0.27)\n\nPatients who had received 1 prior \nVEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy (%)\n\n66 (25.3) 27 (20.6)\n\nNumber of progressions or deaths 31 25\nMedian PFS in months (95% CI) 15.1 (8.8, NE) 3.6 (1.9, 3.7)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b,c 0.22 (0.12, 0.41)\n\nObjective Response Ratea\n\nNumber of objective responders (%) 169 (64.8) 2 (1.5)\n(95% CI) (59.0, 70.5) (0.0, 3.6)\nP-valueb <0.0001\nNumber of complete responses 4 0\nNumber of partial responses 165 2\nMedian time to objective response,d months (95% CI) 2.0 (1.9, 3.5) 5.6 (1.8, 9.4)\nDuration of response,d months, median (95% CI) NE (16.8, NE) NE (NE, NE)\n\n\n\n25\n\nOverall Survival\nNumber of deaths (%) 71 (27.2) 47 (35.9)\nMedian OS in months (95% CI) NE (22.0, NE) NE (20.3, \n\nNE)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b, e 0.73 (0.50, 1.07)\nP-value b, e 0.1032\n\nCI, confidence interval; NE, not estimable; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression-free survival; \nRPSFT, rank preserving structural failure time model; VEGF/VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth \nfactor / vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. \na: Independent radiologic review.\nb: Stratified by region (Europe vs. North America vs. Other), age group (\u226465 years vs >65 years), \n\nand previous VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy (0 vs. 1).\nc: Estimated with Cox proportional hazard model.\nd: Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the 95% CI was constructed with a generalised \n\nBrookmeyer and Crowley method in patients with a best overall response of complete response \nor partial response.\n\ne: Not adjusted for crossover effect.\n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier Curve of Progression-Free Survival - DTC\n\nCI, confidence interval; NE, not estimable.\n\nHepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of lenvatinib have been evaluated in an international, multicenter, \nopen-label, randomised phase 3 study (REFLECT) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (HCC).\n\nIn total, 954 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either lenvatinib (12 mg [baseline body weight \n\u226560 kg] or 8 mg [baseline body weight <60 kg]) given orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg given \norally twice daily.\n\n\n\n26\n\nPatients were eligible to participate if they had a liver function status of Child-Pugh class A and \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1. Patients were excluded \nwho had prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced/unresectable HCC or any prior anti-VEGF \ntherapy. Target lesions previously treated with radiotherapy or locoregional therapy had to show \nradiographic evidence of disease progression. Patients with \u226550% liver occupation, clear invasion into \nthe bile duct or a main branch of the portal vein (Vp4) on imaging were also excluded.\n\n\uf0b7 Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the lenvatinib and the \nsorafenib groups and are shown below for all 954 randomised patients:\n\n\uf0b7 Median age: 62 years \n\uf0b7 Male: 84% \n\uf0b7 White: 29%, Asian: 69%, Black or African American: 1.4%\n\uf0b7 Body weight: <60 kg -31%, 60-80 kg \u2013 50%, >80 kg - 19%\n\uf0b7 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0: 63%, ECOG PS of \n\n1: 37% \n\uf0b7 Child-Pugh A: 99%, Child-Pugh B: 1% \n\uf0b7 Aetiology: Hepatitis B (50%), Hepatitis C (23%), alcohol (6%) \n\uf0b7 Absence of macroscopic portal vein invasion (MPVI): 79%\n\uf0b7 Absence of MPVI, extra-hepatic tumour spread (EHS) or both: 30% \n\uf0b7 Underlying cirrhosis (by independent imaging review): 75%\n\uf0b7 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B: 20%; BCLC stage C: 80% \n\uf0b7 Prior treatments: hepatectomy (28%), radiotherapy (11%), loco-regional therapies including \n\ntransarterial (chemo)embolisation (52%), radiofrequency ablation (21%) and percutaneous \nethanol injection (4%)\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). Lenvatinib was non-inferior for OS to \nsorafenib with HR = 0.92 [95% CI of (0.79, 1.06)] and a median OS of 13.6 months vs 12.3 months \n(see Table 7 and Figure 2).

HR was estimated from the Cox proportional hazard model with treatment as independent variable and \n\nstratified by IxRS stratification factors. The Efron method was used for ties.\n5. + = censored observations.\n\nIn subgroup analyses by stratification factors (presence or absence of MPVI or EHS or both, ECOG \nPS 0 or 1, BW <60 kg or \u226560 kg and region) the HR consistently favoured lenvatinib over sorafenib, \nwith the exception of Western region [HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.82, 1.42], patients without EHS [HR of \n1.01 (95% CI 0.78, 1.30)] and patients without MPVI, EHS or both [HR of 1.05 (0.79, 1.40)]. The \nresults of subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution.\nThe median duration of treatment was 5.7 months (Q1: 2.9, Q3: 11.1) in the lenvatinib arm and \n3.7 months (Q1: 1.8, Q3: 7.4) in the sorafenib arm.\nIn both treatment arms in the REFLECT study, median OS was approximately 9 months longer in \nsubjects who received post-treatment anticancer therapy than in those who did not. In the lenvatinib \narm, median OS was 19.5 months (95% CI: 15.7, 23.0) for subjects who received post-treatment \nanticancer therapy (43%) and 10.5 months (95% CI: 8.6, 12.2) for those who did not. In the sorafenib \narm, median OS was 17.0 months (95% CI: 14.2, 18.8) for subjects who received posttreatment \nanticancer therapy (51%) and 7.9 months (95% CI: 6.6, 9.7) for those who did not. Median OS was \nlonger by approximately 2.5 months in the lenvatinib compared with the sorafenib arm in both subsets \nof subjects (with or without post-treatment anticancer therapy).\n\nQT interval prolongation\n\nA single 32-mg dose of lenvatinib did not prolong the QT/QTc interval based on results from a \nthorough QT study in healthy volunteers; however, QT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported at \na higher incidence in patients treated with lenvatinib than in patients treated with placebo (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has deferred the obligation to submit the results of a study \nwith lenvatinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of radioiodine-\nrefractory differentiated thyroid cancer and has has waived the obligation to submit the results of \nstudies with lenvatinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\n\n29\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of lenvatinib have been studied in healthy adult subjects, adult subjects \nwith hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and solid tumours.\n\nAbsorption\n\nLenvatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with tmax typically observed from 1 to 4 hours \npostdose. Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but slows the rate of absorption. When \nadministered with food to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are delayed by 2 hours.\nAbsolute bioavailability has not been determined in humans; however, data from a mass-balance study \nsuggest that it is in the order of 85%. Lenvatinib exhibited good oral bioavailability in dogs (70.4%) \nand monkeys (78.4%).\n\nDistribution\n\nIn vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins is high and ranged from 98% to 99% \n(0.3 - 30 \u03bcg/mL, mesilate). This binding was mainly to albumin with minor binding to \u03b11-acid \nglycoprotein and \u03b3-globulin.\n\nIn vitro, the lenvatinib blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.589 to 0.608 (0.1 \u2013\n10 \u03bcg/mL, mesilate ).\n\nLenvatinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Lenvatinib is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K or the bile salt export pump BSEP.\n\nIn patients, the median apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of the first dose ranged from 50.5 L to \n92 L and was generally consistent across the dose groups from 3.2 mg to 32 mg. The analogous \nmedian apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vz/Fss) was also generally consistent and \nranged from 43.2 L to 121 L.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro, cytochrome P450 3A4 was demonstrated as the predominant (>80%) isoform involved in the \nP450-mediated metabolism of lenvatinib. However, in vivo data indicated that non-P450-mediated \npathways contributed to a significant portion of the overall metabolism of lenvatinib. Consequently, in \nvivo, inducers and inhibitors of CYP 3A4 had a minimal effect on lenvatinib exposure (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nIn human liver microsomes, the demethylated form of lenvatinib (M2) was identified as the main \nmetabolite. M2\u2019 and M3\u2019, the major metabolites in human faeces, were formed from M2 and \nlenvatinib, respectively, by aldehyde oxidase.\n\nIn plasma samples collected up to 24 hours after administration, lenvatinib constituted 97% of the \nradioactivity in plasma radiochromatograms while the M2 metabolite accounted for an additional \n2.5%. Based on AUC(0 \u2013 inf), lenvatinib accounted for 60% and 64% of the total radioactivity in plasma \nand blood, respectively.\n\n\n\n30\n\nData from a human mass balance/excretion study indicate lenvatinib is extensively metabolised in \nhumans. The main metabolic pathways in humans were identified as oxidation by aldehyde oxidase, \ndemethylation via CYP3A4, glutathione conjugation with elimination of the O-aryl group \n(chlorophenyl moiety), and combinations of these pathways followed by further biotransformations \n(e.g., glucuronidation, hydrolysis of the glutathione moiety, degradation of the cysteine moiety, and \nintramolecular rearrangement of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates with subsequent \ndimerisation). These in vivo metabolic routes align with the data provided in the in vitro studies using \nhuman biomaterials.\n\nIn vitro transporter studies\n\nFor the following transporters, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, and BSEP, clinically relevant \ninhibition was excluded based on a cutoff of IC50> 50 \uf0b4 Cmax,unbound.\n\nLenvatinib showed minimal or no inhibitory activities toward P-gp-mediated and breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP)-mediated transport activities. Similarly, no induction of P-gp mRNA \nexpression was observed .\n\nLenvatinib showed minimal or no inhibitory effect on OATP1B3 and MATE2-K. Lenvatinib weakly \ninhibits MATE1. In human liver cytosol, lenvatinib did not inhibit aldehyde oxidase activity.\n\nElimination\n\nPlasma concentrations decline bi-exponentially following Cmax. The mean terminal exponential half-\nlife of lenvatinib is approximately 28 hours.\n\nFollowing administration of radiolabelled lenvatinib to 6 patients with solid tumours, approximately \ntwo-thirds and one-quarter of the radiolabel were eliminated in the faeces and urine, respectively. The \nM3 metabolite was the predominant analyte in excreta (~17% of the dose), followed by M2\u2019 (~11% of \nthe dose) and M2 (~4.4 of the dose).\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nDose proportionality and accumulation\nIn patients with solid tumours administered single and multiple doses of lenvatinib once daily, \nexposure to lenvatinib (Cmax and AUC) increased in direct proportion to the administered dose over the \nrange of 3.2 to 32 mg once-daily.\n\nLenvatinib displays minimimal accumulation at steady state. Over this range, the median accumulation \nindex (Rac) ranged from 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). The Rac in HCC subjects with mild and \nmoderate liver impairment was similar to that reported for other solid tumours.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10-mg dose were evaluated in 6 subjects each \nwith mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B, respectively). A 5-mg \ndose was evaluated in 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Eight healthy, \ndemographically matched subjects served as controls and received a 10-mg dose. Lenvatinib exposure, \nbased on dose-adjusted AUC0-t and AUC0-inf data, was 119%, 107%, and 180% of normal for subjects \nwith mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. It has been determined that plasma \nprotein binding in plasma from hepatically impaired subjects was similar to the respective matched \nhealthy subjects and no concentration dependency was observed. See section 4.2 for dosing \nrecommendation.\n\n\n\n31\n\nThere are not sufficient data for HCC patients with Child-Pugh B (moderate hepatic impairment, 3 \npatients treated with lenvima in the pivotal trial) and no data available in Child-Pugh C HCC patients \n(severe hepatic impairment). Lenvatinib is mainly eliminated via the liver and exposure might be \nincreased in these patient populations.\n\nThe median half-life was comparable in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment \nas well as those with normal hepatic function and ranged from 26 hours to 31 hours. The percentage of \nthe dose of lenvatinib excreted in urine was low in all cohorts (<2.16% across treatment cohorts).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 24-mg dose were evaluated in 6 subjects each \nwith mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and compared with 8 healthy, demographically \nmatched subjects. Subjects with end-stage renal disease were not studied.\n\nLenvatinib exposure, based on AUC0-inf data, was 101%, 90%, and 122% of normal for subjects with \nmild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. It has been determined that plasma protein \nbinding in plasma from renally impaired subjects was similar to the respective matched healthy \nsubjects and no concentration dependency was observed. See section 4.2 for dosing recommendation.\n\nAge, sex, weight, race\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving up to 24 mg lenvatinib once \ndaily, age, sex, weight, and race (Japanese vs. other, Caucasian vs. other) had no significant effects on \nclearance (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric Population\nPaediatric patients have not been studied.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn the repeated-dose toxicity studies (up to 39 weeks), lenvatinib caused toxicologic changes in \nvarious organs and tissues related to the expected pharmacologic effects of lenvatinib including \nglomerulopathy, testicular hypocellularity, ovarian follicular atresia, gastrointestinal changes, bone \nchanges, changes to the adrenals (rats and dogs), and arterial (arterial fibrinoid necrosis, medial \ndegeneration, or haemorrhage) lesions in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Elevated transaminase \nlevels asociated with signs of hepatotoxicity, were also observed in rats, dogs and monkeys.\nReversibility of the toxicologic changes was observed at the end of a 4-week recovery period in all \nanimal species investigated.\n\nGenotoxicity\n\nLenvatinib was not genotoxic.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lenvatinib.\n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity\n\nNo specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility.\nHowever, testicular (hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium) and ovarian changes (follicular \natresia) were observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies in animals at exposures 11 to 15 times (rat) or \n0.6 to 7 times (monkey) the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the maximum tolerated \nhuman dose. These findings were reversible at the end of a 4-week recovery period.\n\nAdministration of lenvatinib during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and teratogenicity in \nrats (foetal external and skeletal anomalies) at exposures below the clinical exposure (based on AUC) \nat the maximum tolerated human dose, and rabbits (foetal external, visceral or skeletal anomalies) \nbased on body surface area; mg/m2 at the maximum tolerated human dose. These findings indicate that \n\n\n\n32\n\nlenvatinib has a teratogenic potential, likely related to the pharmacologic activity of lenvatinib as an \nantiangiogenic agent.\n\nLenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk. \n\nJuvenile animal toxicity studies\n\nMortality was the dose-limiting toxicity in juvenile rats in which dosing was initiated on postnatal day \n(PND) 7 or PND21 and was observed at exposures that were respectively 125- or 12-fold lower \ncompared with the exposure at which mortality was observed in adult rats, suggesting an increasing \nsensitivity to toxicity with decreasing age. Therefore, mortality may be attributed to complications \nrelated to primary duodenal lesions with possible contribution from additional toxicities in immature \ntarget organs.\nThe toxicity of lenvatinib was more prominent in younger rats (dosing initiated on PND7) compared \nwith those with dosing initiated on PND21 and mortality and some toxicities were observed earlier in \nthe juvenile rats at 10 mg/kg compared with adult rats administered the same dose level. Growth \nretardation, secondary delay of physical development, and lesions attributable to pharmacologic \neffects (incisors, femur [epiphyseal growth plate], kidneys, adrenals, and duodenum) were also \nobserved in juvenile rats.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What LENVIMA is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take LENVIMA\n3. How to take LENVIMA\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store LENVIMA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What LENVIMA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat LENVIMA is\nLENVIMA is a medicine that contains the active substance lenvatinib. It is used on its own to treat \nprogressive or advanced thyroid cancer in adults when radioactive iodine treatment has not helped to \nstop the disease.\n\nLENVIMA can also be used on its own to treat liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in adults who \nhave not previously been treated with another anticancer medicine that travels through the \nbloodstream. People get LENVIMA when their liver cancer has spread or cannot be taken out by \nsurgery. \n\nHow LENVIMA works\nLENVIMA blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved \nin the development of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to cells and help them to \ngrow. These proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action \nLENVIMA may slow the rate at which the cancer cells multiply and the tumour grows and help to cut \noff the blood supply that the cancer needs.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take LENVIMA\n\nDo not take LENVIMA if:\n\uf0b7 you are allergic to lenvatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\uf0b7 you are breast-feeding (see the section below on Contraception, pregnancy and breast-feeding).\n\n\n\n46\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking LENVIMA if you:\n\uf0b7 have high blood pressure \n\uf0b7 are a woman able to become pregnant (see the section below on Contraception, pregnancy and \n\nbreast-feeding)\n\uf0b7 have a history of heart problems or stroke\n\uf0b7 have liver or kidney problems\n\uf0b7 have had recent surgery or radiotherapy\n\uf0b7 need to have a surgical procedure. Your doctor may consider stopping LENVIMA if you will be \n\nundergoing a major surgical procedure as LENVIMA may affect wound healing. LENVIMA \nmay be restarted once adequate wound healing is established.\n\n\uf0b7 are over 75 years \n\uf0b7 belong to an ethnic group other than White or Asian \n\uf0b7 weigh less than 60 kg\n\uf0b7 have a history of abnormal connections (known as a fistula) between different organs in the \n\nbody or from an organ to the skin\n\uf0b7 If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a \n\ntear in a blood vessel wall.\n\nBefore taking LENVIMA, your doctor may carry out some tests, for example to check your blood \npressure and your liver or kidney function and to see if you have low levels of salt and high levels of \nthyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you \nand decide whether you can be given LENVIMA. You may need to have additional treatment with \nother medicines, to take a lower dose of LENVIMA, or to take extra care due to an increased risk of \nside effects.\n\nIf you are not sure talk to your doctor before taking LENVIMA.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nLENVIMA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. The effects of LENVIMA in \npeople younger than 18 years old are not known.\n\nOther medicines and LENVIMA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes herbal preparations and medicines without a prescription.\n\nContraception, pregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\uf0b7 If you could become pregnant, use highly effective contraception while taking this medicine, \n\nand for at least one month after you finish treatment. Because it is not known if LENVIMA can \nreduce the effect of the oral contraceptive pill, if this is your normal method of contraception \nyou should ensure you also add a barrier method such as the cap or condoms if you have sex \nduring treatment with LENVIMA.\n\n\uf0b7 Do not take LENVIMA if you are planning to become pregnant during your treatment. This is \nbecause it may seriously harm your baby.\n\n\uf0b7 If you become pregnant while being treated with LENVIMA, tell your doctor immediately. \nYour doctor will help you decide whether the treatment should be continued.\n\n\uf0b7 Do not breast-feed if you are taking LENVIMA. This is because the medicine passes into breast \nmilk and may seriously harm your breastfed baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nLENVIMA may cause side effects that can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving \nor using machines if you feel dizzy or tired.\n\n\n\n47\n\n3. How to take LENVIMA\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

After drinking, add the same amount of water or apple juice, \nswirl and swallow. \n\n\uf0b7 Take the capsules at about the same time each day.\n\uf0b7 Caregivers should not open the capsules to avoid exposure to the contents of the capsule.\n\nHow long to take LENVIMA\nYou will usually carry on taking this medicine as long as you are getting benefit.\n\nIf you take more LENVIMA than you should\nIf you take more LENVIMA than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away. Take the \nmedicine pack with you.\n\nIf you forget to take LENVIMA\nDo not take a double dose (two doses at the same time) to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nWhat to do if you forget to take your dose depends on how long it is until your next dose.\n\uf0b7 If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose: take the missed dose as soon as you remember. \n\nThen take the next dose at the normal time.\n\uf0b7 If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose: skip the missed dose.

used on its own to treat progressive or advanced thyroid cancer in adults when radioactive iodine treatment has not helped to stop the disease. lenvima can also be used on its own to treat liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in adults who have not previously been treated with another anticancer medicine that travels through the bloodstream. people get lenvima when their liver cancer has spread or cannot be taken out by surgery. how lenvima works lenvima blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks), which are involved in the development of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to cells and help them to grow. these proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action lenvima may slow the rate at which the cancer cells multiply and the tumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer needs.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "lenvima", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

connections (known as a fistula) between different organs in the body or from an organ to the skin if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in a blood vessel wall. before taking lenvima, your doctor may carry out some tests, for example to check your blood pressure and your liver or kidney function and to see if you have low levels of salt and high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you and decide whether you can be given lenvima. you may need to have additional treatment with other medicines, to take a lower dose of lenvima, or to take extra care due to an increased risk of side effects. if you are not sure talk to your doctor before taking lenvima. children and adolescents lenvima is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. the effects of lenvima in people younger than 18 years old are not known. other medicines and lenvima tell your doctor

become pregnant, use highly effective contraception while taking this medicine, and for at least one month after you finish treatment. because it is not known if lenvima can reduce the effect of the oral contraceptive pill, if this is your normal method of contraception you should ensure you also add a barrier method such as the cap or condoms if you have sex during treatment with lenvima. do not take lenvima if you are planning to become pregnant during your treatment. this is because it may seriously harm your baby. if you become pregnant while being treated with lenvima, tell your doctor immediately. your doctor will help you decide whether the treatment should be continued. do not breast-feed if you are taking lenvima. this is because the medicine passes into breast milk and may seriously harm your breastfed baby. driving and using machines lenvima may cause side effects that can affect your ability to drive or use machines. avoid driving or using machines if you feel dizzy
