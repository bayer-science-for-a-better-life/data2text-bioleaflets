NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMULTAQ 400 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 400 mg of dronedarone (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipient with known effect: \n \nEach tablet also contains 41.65 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite, oblong shaped tablets, engraved with a double wave marking on one side and “4142”code on \nthe other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMULTAQ is indicated for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after successful cardioversion in adult \nclinically stable patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Due to its safety profile \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4), MULTAQ should only be prescribed after alternative treatment options \nhave been considered. \nMULTAQ must not be given to patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or to patients with \ncurrent or previous episodes of heart failure. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and monitored only under specialist supervision (see section 4.4). \nTreatment with dronedarone can be initiated in an outpatient setting. \n \nTreatment with Class I or III antiarrhythmics (such as flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, \ndisopyramide, dofetilide, sotalol, amiodarone) must be stopped before starting dronedarone.  \nThere is limited information on the optimal timing to switch from amiodarone to dronedarone. It \nshould be considered that amiodarone may have a long duration of action after discontinuation due to \nits long half-life. If a switch is envisaged, this should be done under the supervision of a specialist (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.1). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 400 mg twice daily in adults. It should be taken as:  \n one tablet with the morning meal and  \n one tablet with the evening meal.  \n \nGrapefruit juice should not be taken together with to dronedarone (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIf a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose at the regular scheduled time and should not \ndouble the dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nEfficacy and safety were comparable in elderly patients who did not suffer from other cardiovascular \ndiseases and younger patients. In patients ≥75years old, clinical signs of heart failure and ECG should \nbe monitored on a regular basis when co-morbidities are present (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \nAlthough plasma exposure in elderly females was increased in a pharmacokinetic study conducted in \nhealthy subjects, dose adjustments are not considered necessary (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDronedarone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment because of the absence of \ndata (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment  \nDronedarone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n(CrCl) <30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). No dose adjustment is required in other patients with renal \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of MULTAQ in children aged below 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nIt is recommended to swallow the tablet whole with a drink of water during a meal. The tablet cannot \nbe divided into equal doses. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n Second- or third- degree atrio-ventricular block, complete bundle branch block, distal block, \n\nsinus node dysfunction, atrial conduction defects, or sick sinus syndrome (except when used in \nconjunction with a functioning pacemaker) \n\n Bradycardia <50 beats per minute (bpm) \n Permanent AF with an AF duration ≥6 months (or duration unknown) and attempts to restore \n\nsinus rhythm no longer considered by the physician \n Patients in unstable hemodynamic conditions \n History of, or current heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction  \n Patients with liver and lung toxicity related to the previous use of amiodarone \n Co-administration with potent cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone and \nritonavir (see section 4.5) \n\n Medicinal products inducing torsades de pointes such as phenothiazines, cisapride, bepridil, \ntricyclic antidepressants, terfenadine and certain oral macrolides (such as erythromycin), Class I \nand III antiarrhythmics (see section 4.5) \n\n QTc Bazett interval ≥500 milliseconds \n Severe hepatic impairment \n Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) \n Co-administration with dabigatran \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCareful monitoring during dronedarone administration is recommended by regular assessment of \ncardiac, hepatic and pulmonary function (see below). If AF reoccurs, discontinuation of dronedarone \nshould be considered.  \nTreatment with dronedarone should be stopped during the course of treatment, in case the patient \ndevelops any of the conditions which would lead to a contraindication as mentioned in section 4.3.  \nMonitoring of co-administered medicinal products like digoxin and anti-coagulants is necessary.  \n \nPatients developing permanent AF during treatment  \n \nA clinical study in patients with permanent AF (AF duration for at least 6 months) and cardiovascular \nrisk factors was stopped early due to an excess of cardiovascular death, stroke and heart failure in \npatients receiving dronedarone (see section 5.1). It is recommended to perform ECGs serially, at least \nevery 6 months. If patients treated with dronedarone develop permanent AF, treatment with \ndronedarone should be discontinued. \n \nPatients with history of, or current heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction \n \nDronedarone is contraindicated in patients in unstable hemodynamic conditions, with history of, or \ncurrent heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see section 4.3).  \nPatients should be carefully evaluated for symptoms of Congestive Heart Failure. There have been \nspontaneously reported events of new or worsening heart failure during treatment with dronedarone. \nPatients should be advised to consult a physician if they develop or experience signs or symptoms of \nheart failure, such as weight gain, dependent oedema, or increased dyspnoea. If heart failure develops, \ntreatment with dronedarone should be discontinued. \nPatients should be followed for the development of left ventricular systolic dysfunction during \ntreatment. If left ventricular systolic dysfunction develops, treatment with dronedarone should be \ndiscontinued. \n \nPatients with coronary artery disease  \n \nIn patients with coronary artery disease, clinical signs of heart failure and ECG should be regularly \nmonitored to detect early signs of heart failure. In ESC and ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines dronedarone \nhas a class IA recommendation in patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF and coronary artery disease. \n \nElderly \n \nIn elderly patients ≥75 years with multiple co-morbidities, clinical signs of heart failure and ECG \nshould be monitored on a regular basis (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nLiver injury \n \nHepatocellular liver injury, including life-threatening acute liver failure, has been reported in patients \ntreated with dronedarone in the post-marketing setting. Liver function tests should be performed prior \nto initiation of treatment with dronedarone, after one week and after one month following initiation of \ntreatment and then repeated monthly for six months, at months 9 and 12, and periodically thereafter.  \nIf alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are elevated ≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT levels \nshould be re-measured within 48 to 72 hours. If ALT levels are confirmed to be ≥3 × ULN, treatment \nwith dronedarone should be withdrawn. Appropriate investigation and close observation of patients \nshould continue until normalisation of ALT.  \nPatients should immediately report any symptoms of potential liver injury (such as sustained \nnew-onset abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, fatigue, jaundice, dark urine or \nitching) to their physician.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nManagement of plasma creatinine increase \n \nAn increase in plasma creatinine (mean increase 10 μmol/L) has been observed with dronedarone \n400 mg twice daily in healthy subjects and in patients. In most patients this increase occurs early after \ntreatment initiation and reaches a plateau after 7 days. It is recommended to measure plasma creatinine \nvalues prior to and 7 days after initiation of dronedarone. If an increase in creatininaemia is observed, \nserum creatinine should be re-measured after a further 7 days. If no further increase in creatininaemia \nis observed, this value should be used as the new reference baseline taking into account that this may \nbe expected with dronedarone. If serum creatinine continues to rise then consideration should be given \nto further investigation and discontinuing treatment.  \nAn increase in creatininaemia should not necessarily lead to the discontinuation of treatment with \nACE inhibitors or Angiotensin II Receptors Antagonists (AIIRAs). \nLarger increases in creatinine after dronedarone initiation have been reported in the post-marketing \nsetting. Some cases also reported increases in blood urea nitrogen possibly due to hypoperfusion \nsecondary to developing CHF (pre-renal azotaemia). In such cases dronedarone should be stopped (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). It is recommended to monitor renal function periodically and to consider further \ninvestigations as needed. \n \nElectrolytes imbalance  \n \nSince antiarrhythmic medicinal products may be ineffective or may be arrhythmogenic in patients with \nhypokalaemia, any potassium or magnesium deficiency should be corrected before initiation and \nduring dronedarone therapy. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nThe pharmacological action of dronedarone may induce a moderate QTc Bazett prolongation (about \n10 msec), related to prolonged repolarisation. These changes are linked to the therapeutic effect of \ndronedarone and do not reflect toxicity. Follow up, including ECG (electrocardiogram), is \nrecommended during treatment. If QTc Bazett interval is ≥500 milliseconds, dronedarone should be \nstopped (see section 4.3). \nBased on clinical experience, dronedarone has a low pro-arrhythmic effect and has shown a decrease \nin arrhythmic death in the ATHENA study (see section 5.1). \nHowever, proarrhythmic effects may occur in particular situations such as concomitant use with \nmedicinal products favouring arrhythmia and/or electrolytic disorders (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  \n \nCases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in \npost-marketing experience. Onset of dyspnoea or non-productive cough may be related to pulmonary \ntoxicity and patients should be carefully evaluated clinically. If pulmonary toxicity is confirmed, \ntreatment should be discontinued.  \n \nInteractions (see section 4.5) \n \nDigoxin  \nAdministration of dronedarone to patients receiving digoxin will bring about an increase in the plasma \ndigoxin concentration and thus precipitate symptoms and signs associated with digoxin toxicity. \nClinical, ECG and biological monitoring is recommended, and digoxin dose should be halved. A \nsynergistic effect on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction is also possible. \n \nBeta-blockers and calcium antagonists \nThe co-administration of beta-blockers or calcium antagonists with depressant effect on sinus and \natrio-ventricular node should be undertaken with caution. These medicinal products should be initiated \nat low dose and up titration should be done only after ECG assessment. In patients already on calcium \n\n\n\n6 \n\nantagonists or beta blockers at time of dronedarone initiation, an ECG should be performed and the \ndose should be adjusted if needed. \n \nVitamin K antagonists \nPatients should be appropriately anti-coagulated as per clinical AF guidelines. International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) should be closely monitored after initiating dronedarone in patients taking \nvitamin K antagonists as per their label. \n \nPotent CYP3A4 inducers  \nPotent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John’s \nWort are not recommended. \n \nStatins  \nStatins should be used with caution. Lower starting dose and maintenance doses of statins should be \nconsidered and patients monitored for clinical signs of muscular toxicity.  \n \nGrapefruit juice \nPatients should be warned to avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking dronedarone.  \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDronedarone is primarily metabolised by CYP 3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, inhibitors and \ninducers of CYP 3A4 have the potential to interact on dronedarone.  \nDronedarone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP 3A4, a mild inhibitor of CYP 2D6 and a potent inhibitor \nof P-glycoproteins (P-gp). Dronedarone has, therefore, the potential to interact on medicinal products \nsubstrates of P-glycoproteins, CYP 3A4 or CYP 2D6. Dronedarone and/or its metabolites also have \nbeen shown to inhibit transport proteins of the Organic Anion Transporter (OAT), Organic Anion \nTransporting Polypeptide (OATP) and Organic Cation Transporter (OCT) families in vitro. \nDronedarone has no significant potential to inhibit CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP 2C8 and \nCYP 2B6.  \nA potential pharmacodynamic interaction can also be expected with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists \nand digitalis. \n \nMedicinal products inducing torsades de pointes \n \nMedicinal products inducing torsades de pointes such as phenothiazines, cisapride, bepridil, tricyclic \nantidepressants, certain oral macrolides (such as erythromycin), terfenadine and Class I and III \nantiarrhythmics are contraindicated because of the potential risk of proarrhythmia (see section 4.3).  \nIn patients already taking beta-blockers at time of dronedarone initiation, an ECG should be performed \nand the dose of beta-blocker should be adjusted if needed (see section 4.4). \nClinical, ECG and biological monitoring is recommended, and digoxin dose should be halved (see \nsection 4.4). \n  \nEffect of other medicinal products on dronedarone  \n \nPotent CYP 3A4 inhibitors \nRepeated doses of 200 mg ketoconazole daily resulted in a 17-fold increase in dronedarone exposure. \nTherefore, concomitant use of ketoconazole as well as other potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as \nitraconazole, voriconazole, pozaconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin or nefazodone is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nModerate/weak CYP 3A4 inhibitors \n \nErythromycin \nErythromycin, an oral macrolide, may induce torsades de pointes and, as such, is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). Repeated doses of erythromycin (500 mg three times a day for 10 days) resulted in an \nincrease in steady state dronedarone exposure of 3.8-fold. \n \nCalcium antagonists \nCalcium antagonists, diltiazem and verapamil, are substrates and/or moderate inhibitors of CYP 3A4. \nMoreover, due to their heart rate-lowering properties, verapamil and diltiazem have the potential to \ninteract with dronedarone from a pharmacodynamic point of view. \nRepeated doses of diltiazem (240 mg twice daily), verapamil (240 mg once daily) and nifedipine \n(20 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase in dronedarone exposure of 1.7-, 1.4- and 1.2-fold, \nrespectively. Calcium antagonists also have their exposure increased by dronedarone (400 mg twice \ndaily) (verapamil by 1.4-fold, and nisoldipine by 1.5-fold). In clinical studies, 13% of patients received \ncalcium antagonists concomitantly with dronedarone. There was no increased risk of hypotension, \nbradycardia and heart failure. \nOverall, due to the pharmacokinetic interaction and possible pharmacodynamic interaction, calcium \nantagonists with depressant effects on sinus and atrio-ventricular node such as verapamil and diltiazem \nshould be used with caution when associated with dronedarone. These medicinal products should be \ninitiated at low dose and up-titration should be done only after ECG assessment. In patients already on \ncalcium antagonists at time of dronedarone initiation, an ECG should be performed and the calcium \nantagonist dose should be adjusted if needed (see section 4.4). \n \nOther moderate/weak CYP 3A4 Inhibitors \nOther moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are also likely to increase dronedarone exposure.  \n \nCYP 3A4 inducers \nRifampicin (600 mg once daily) decreased dronedarone exposure by 80% with no major change on its \nactive metabolite exposure. Therefore, co-administration of rifampicin and other potent CYP 3A4 \ninducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John’s Wort is not recommended as \nthey decrease dronedarone exposure. \n \nMAO inhibitors \nIn an in vitro study MAO contributed to the metabolism of the active metabolite of dronedarone. The \nclinical relevance of this observation is not known (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nEffect of dronedarone on other medicinal products \n \nInteraction with medicinal products metabolised by CYP 3A4 \n \nDabigatran \nWhen dabigatran etexilate 150 mg once daily was co-administered with dronedarone 400 mg twice \ndaily, the dabigatran AUC0-24, and Cmax were increased by 100% and 70%, respectively. No clinical \ndata are available regarding the co-administration of these medicinal products in AF patients. Their \nco-administration is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nStatins \nDronedarone can increase exposure of statins that are substrates of CYP 3A4 and/or P-gp substrates. \nDronedarone (400 mg twice daily) increased simvastatin and simvastatin acid exposure by 4-fold and \n2-fold respectively. It is predicted that dronedarone could also increase the exposure of lovastatin \nwithin the same range as simvastatin acid. There was a weak interaction between dronedarone and \natorvastatin (which resulted in a mean 1.7-fold increase in atorvastatin exposure). There was a weak \ninteraction between dronedarone and statins transported by OATP, such as rosuvastatin (which \nresulted in a mean 1.4-fold increase in rosuvastatin exposure). \n\n\n\n8 \n\nIn clinical trials, there was no evidence of safety concerns when dronedarone was co-administered \nwith statins metabolised by CYP 3A4. However, spontaneously reported cases of rhabdomyolysis \nwhen dronedarone was given in combination with a statin (simvastatin in particular) have been \nreported, and, therefore, concomitant use of statins should be undertaken with caution. Lower starting \ndose and maintenance doses of statins should be considered according to the statin label \nrecommendations and patients monitored for clinical signs of muscular toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nCalcium antagonists  \nThe interaction of dronedarone on calcium antagonists is described above (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunosupressants \nDronedarone could increase plasma concentrations of immunosupressants (tacrolimus, sirolimus, \neverolimus and cyclosporine). Monitoring of their plasma concentrations and appropriate dose \nadjustment is recommended in case of coadministration with dronedarone. \n \nOral contraceptives \nNo decreases in ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were observed in healthy subjects receiving \ndronedarone (800 mg twice daily) concomitantly with oral contraceptives. \n \nInteraction with medicinal products metabolised by CYP 2D6 \n \nBeta-blockers  \nSotalol must be stopped before starting dronedarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). Beta-blockers that are \nmetabolised by CYP 2D6 can have their exposure increased by dronedarone. Moreover, beta-blockers \nhave the potential to interact with dronedarone from a pharmacodynamic point of view. Dronedarone \n800 mg daily increased metoprolol exposure by 1.6-fold and propranolol exposure by 1.3-fold (i.e. \nmuch below the 6-fold differences observed between poor and extensive CYP 2D6 metabolisers). In \nclinical studies, bradycardia was more frequently observed when dronedarone was given in \ncombination with beta-blockers.  \nDue to the pharmacokinetic interaction and possible pharmacodynamic interaction, beta-blockers \nshould be used with caution concomitantly with dronedarone. These medicinal products should be \ninitiated at low dose and up-titration should be done only after ECG assessment. In patients already \ntaking beta-blockers at time of dronedarone initiation, an ECG should be performed and the beta-\nblocker dose should be adjusted if needed (see section 4.4).  \n \nAntidepressants \nSince dronedarone is a weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6 in humans, it is predicted to have limited \ninteraction on antidepressant medicinal products metabolised by CYP 2D6. \n \nInteraction with P-gp substrates \n \nDigoxin  \nDronedarone (400 mg twice daily) increased digoxin exposure by 2.5-fold by inhibiting P-gp \ntransporter. Moreover, digitalis has the potential to interact with dronedarone from a \npharmacodynamic point of view. A synergistic effect on heart rate and atrio-ventricular conduction is \npossible. In clinical studies, increased levels of digitalis and/or gastrointestinal disorders indicating \ndigitalis toxicity were observed when dronedarone was co-administered with digitalis.  \nThe digoxin dose should be reduced by approximately 50%, serum levels of digoxin should be closely \nmonitored and clinical and ECG monitoring is recommended.  \n\nInteraction with medicinal products metabolised by CYP 3A4 and P-gp  \n\nRivaroxaban \nDronedarone is likely to increase the exposure of rivaroxaban (a CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate) and \nconsequently concomitant use may increase the risk of bleedings. Concomitant use of rivaroxaban and \ndronedarone is not recommended. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nApixaban \nDronedarone may increase the exposure of apixaban (a CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate). However, no \ndose adjustment for apixaban is required when co-administered with agents that are not strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as dronedarone. \n \nEdoxaban  \nIn in vivo studies edoxaban (a CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate) exposure was increased when \nadministered with dronedarone. The edoxaban dose should be reduced according to the edoxaban label \nrecommendations. \n \nInteraction with warfarin and losartan (CYP 2C9 substrates) \n \nWarfarin and other vitamin K antagonists \nDronedarone (600 mg twice daily) increased by 1.2-fold S-warfarin with no change in R-warfarin and \nonly a 1.07 increase in International Normalised Ratio (INR).  \nHowever, clinically significant INR elevations (≥5) usually within 1 week after starting dronedarone \nwere reported in patients taking oral anticoagulants. Consequently, INR should be closely monitored \nafter initiating dronedarone in patients taking vitamin K antagonists as per their label. \n \nLosartan and other Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \nNo interaction was observed between dronedarone and losartan and an interaction between \ndronedarone and other AIIRAs is not expected. \n \nInteraction with theophylline (CYP 1A2 substrate) \nDronedarone 400 mg twice daily does not increase the steady state theophylline exposure. \n \nInteraction with metformin (OCT1 and OCT2 substrate) \nNo interaction was observed between dronedarone and metformin, an OCT1 and OCT2 substrate. \n \nInteraction with omeprazole (CYP 2C19 substrate) \nDronedarone does not affect the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole, a CYP 2C19 substrate.  \n \nInteraction with clopidogrel  \nDronedarone does not affect the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its active metabolite.  \n \nOther information \nPantoprazole (40 mg once daily), a medicinal product which increases gastric pH without any effect \non cytochrome P450, did not interact significantly on dronedarone pharmacokinetics. \n \nGrapefruit juice (CYP 3A4 inhibitor) \n \nRepeated doses of 300 ml of grapefruit juice three times daily resulted in a 3-fold increase in \ndronedarone exposure. Therefore, patients should be warned to avoid grapefruit juice beverages while \ntaking dronedarone (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential and pregnancy  \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of dronedarone in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nMULTAQ is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether dronedarone and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of dronedarone and its \nmetabolites in milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nMULTAQ therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nDronedarone was not shown to alter fertility in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMULTAQ has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, ability to \ndrive and use machines may be affected by adverse reactions such as fatigue. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAssessment of intrinsic factors such as gender or age on the incidence of any treatment emergent \nadverse reactions showed an interaction for gender (female patients) for the incidence of any adverse \nreactions and for serious adverse reactions. \n  \nIn clinical studies, premature discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 11.8% of the \ndronedarone-treated patients and in 7.7% in the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for \ndiscontinuation of therapy with dronedarone were gastrointestinal disorders (3.2% of patients versus \n1.8% in the placebo group). \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with dronedarone 400 mg twice daily in the 5 studies \nwere diarrhoea (9%), nausea (5%) and vomiting (2%), fatigue and asthenia (7%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety profile of dronedarone 400 mg twice daily in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial \nflutter (AFL) is based on 5 placebo controlled studies, in which a total of 6,285 patients were \nrandomised (3,282 patients received dronedarone 400 mg twice daily, and 2,875 received placebo). \nThe mean exposure across studies was 13 months. In ATHENA study, the maximum follow-up was \n30 months. Some adverse reactions were also identified during post-marketing surveillance. \nAdverse reactions are presented by system organ class. \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n \nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery Common \n(1/10) \n\nCommon \n(1/100 to \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(1/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylactic \nreactions \nincluding \nangioedema \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n  Dysgeusia Ageusia \n\nCardiac disorders Congestive heart \nfailure \n(see below) \n\nBradycardia (see \nsections 4.3 and \n4.4) \n \n\n  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n   Vasculitis, \nincluding \nleukocytoclastic \nvasculitis \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Interstitial lung \ndisease including \npneumonitis and \npulmonary fibrosis \n(see below) \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Diarrhoea  \nVomiting  \nNausea \nAbdominal pain \nDyspepsia \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Liver function \ntest \nabnormalities \n\n Hepatocellular \nliver injury, \nincluding \nlife-threatening \nacute liver failure \n(see section 4.4) \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rashes \n(including \ngeneralised, \nmacular, \nmaculo-papular) \nPruritus \n\nErythemas \n(including \nerythema and rash \nerythematous) \nEczema \nPhotosensitivity \nreaction \nDermatitis allergic \nDermatitis \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n \n\n Fatigue \nAsthenia \n\n  \n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine \nincreased*  \n \nQTc Bazett \nprolonged # \n\n   \n\n* ≥10% five days after treatment initiation (see section 4.4) \n# >450 msec in male >470 msec in female (see section 4.4) \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCongestive heart failure \nIn the 5 placebo controlled studies, CHF occurred in the dronedarone group with rates comparable \nwith placebo (very commonly, 11.2% versus 10.9%). This rate should be considered in the context of \nthe underlying elevated incidence of CHF in AF patients. Cases of CHF have also been reported in \npost-marketing experience (frequency not known) (see section 4.4). \n \nInterstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis \nIn the 5 placebo controlled studies, 0.6% of patients in the dronedarone group had pulmonary events \nversus 0.8% of patients receiving placebo. Cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and \npulmonary fibrosis have been reported in post-marketing experience (frequency not known). A \nnumber of patients had been previously exposed to amiodarone (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of overdose, monitor the patient’s cardiac rhythm and blood pressure. Treatment should \nbe supportive and based on symptoms. \n \nIt is not known whether dronedarone and/or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, \nperitoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration). \n \nThere is no specific antidote available. In the event of overdose, treatment should be supportive and \ndirected toward alleviating symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: cardiac therapy, antiarrhythmics class III, ATC code: C01BD07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIn animals, dronedarone prevents atrial fibrillation or restores normal sinus rhythm depending on the \nmodel used. It also prevents ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in several animal \nmodels. These effects most likely result from its electrophysiological properties belonging to all four \nVaughan-Williams classes. Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker inhibiting the potassium currents \n(including IK(Ach), IKur, IKr, IKs) and thus prolonging cardiac action potential and refractory periods \n(Class III). It also inhibits the sodium currents (Class Ib) and the calcium currents (Class IV). It \nnon-competitively antagonises adrenergic activities (Class II). \n \nPharmacodynamic properties \n \nIn animal models, dronedarone reduces the heart rate. It prolongs Wenckebach cycle length and AH-, \nPQ-, QT- intervals; with no marked effect or weak increase on QTc-intervals, and with no change in \nHV- and QRS- intervals. It increases effective refractory periods (ERP) of the atrium, atrio-ventricular \n\n\n\n13 \n\nnode, and ventricular ERP was slightly prolonged with a minimal degree of reverse frequency \ndependency. \nDronedarone decreases arterial blood pressure and myocardial contractility (dP/dt max) with no \nchange in left ventricular ejection fraction and reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. \nDronedarone has vasodilatory properties, in coronary arteries (related to the activation of the nitric \noxide pathway) and in peripheral arteries. \nDronedarone displays indirect antiadrenergic effects and partial antagonism to adrenergic stimulation. \nIt reduces alpha-adrenergic blood pressure response to epinephrine and beta1 and beta2 responses to \nisoproterenol. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nReduction of risk of AF-related hospitalisation \nThe efficacy of dronedarone in the reduction of risk of AF-related hospitalisation was demonstrated in \npatients with AF or a history of AF and additional risk factors in the ATHENA multicenter, \nmultinational, double blind, and randomised placebo-controlled study.  \nPatients were to have at least one risk factor (including age, hypertension, diabetes, prior \ncerebrovascular accident, left atrium diameter ≥50 mm or LVEF <0.40) together with AF/AFL and \nsinus rhythm both documented within the last 6 months. Patients who received amiodarone within \n4 weeks prior to randomisation were not included. Patients could be in AF/AFL or in sinus rhythm \nafter spontaneous conversion or following any procedures. \n \nFour thousand six hundred and twenty eight (4,628) patients were randomised and treated for up to \n30 months maximum (median follow-up: 22 months) with either dronedarone 400 mg twice daily \n(2,301 patients) or placebo (2,327 patients), in addition to conventional therapy including \nbeta-blockers (71%), ACE inhibitors or AIIRAs (69%) digitalis (14%), calcium antagonists (14%), \nstatins (39%), oral anticoagulants (60%), chronic antiplatelet therapy (6%) and/or diuretics (54%). \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the time to first hospitalisation for cardiovascular reasons or \ndeath from any cause. \nPatients ranged in age from 23 to 97 years and 42% were over 75 years old. Forty seven percent (47%) \nof patients were female and a majority was Caucasian (89%).  \n \nThe majority had hypertension (86%) and structural heart disease (60%) (including coronary artery \ndisease: 30%; congestive heart failure (CHF): 30%; LVEF<45%: 12%). \nTwenty five percent (25%) had AF at baseline. \n \nDronedarone reduced the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalisation or death from any cause by \n24.2% when compared to placebo (p<0.0001). \n \nThe reduction in cardiovascular hospitalisation or death from any cause was consistent in all \nsubgroups, irrespective of baseline characteristics or medicinal products (ACE inhibitors or AIIRAs; \nbeta-blockers, digitalis, statins, calcium antagonists, diuretics) (see figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nFigure 1 - Relative risk (dronedarone 400 mg twice daily versus placebo) - first cardiovascular \nhospitalisation or death from any cause.  \n \n\n \na Determined from Cox regression model \nb P-value of interaction between baseline characteristics and treatment based on Cox regression model \nc Calcium antagonists with heart rate lowering effects restricted to diltiazem, verapamil and bepridil \n \nSimilar results were obtained on the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalisation with a risk reduction \nof 25.5% (p <0.0001). \nDuring the course of the study, the number of deaths from any cause was comparable between the \ndronedarone (116/2,301) and placebo (139/2,327) groups. \n \nMaintenance of sinus rhythm \nIn EURIDIS and ADONIS, a total of 1,237 patients with a prior episode of AF or AFL were \nrandomised in an outpatient setting and treated with either dronedarone 400 mg twice daily (n = 828) \nor placebo (n = 409) on top of conventional therapies (including oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, \nACE inhibitors or AIIRAs, chronic antiplatelet agents, diuretics, statins, digitalis, and calcium \nantagonists). Patients had at least one ECG-documented AF/AFL episode during the last 3 months and \nwere in sinus rhythm for at least one hour and were followed for 12 months. In patients who were \ntaking amiodarone, an ECG was to be performed about 4 hours after the first administration to verify \ngood tolerability. Other antiarrhythmic medicinal products had to be withdrawn for at least 5 plasma \nhalf-lives prior to the first administration. \nPatients ranged in age from 20 to 88 years, with the majority being Caucasian (97%), male (69%) \npatients. The most common co-morbidities were hypertension (56.8%) and structural heart disease \n(41.5%) including coronary heart disease (21.8%). \n \nIn the pooled data from EURIDIS and ADONIS as well as in the individual trials, dronedarone \nconsistently delayed the time to first recurrence of AF/AFL (primary endpoint). As compared to \nplacebo, dronedarone lowered the risk of first AF/AFL recurrence during the 12-month study period \n\n\n\n15 \n\nby 25% (p = 0.00007). The median time from randomised to first AF/AFL recurrence in the \ndronedarone group was 116 days, i.e. 2.2-fold longer than in the placebo group (53 days).  \n \nThe DIONYSOS study compared the efficacy and safety of dronedarone (400 mg twice daily) versus \namiodarone (600 mg daily for 28 days, then 200 mg daily thereafter) over 6 months. A total of \n504 patients with documented AF were randomised, 249 received dronedarone and 255 received \namiodarone. Patients ranged in age from 28 to 90 years, 49% were more than 65 years old. The \nincidence of the primary efficacy endpoint defined as first recurrence of AF or premature study drug \ndiscontinuation for intolerance or lack of efficacy at 12 months was 75% in the dronedarone group and \n59% in the amiodarone group (hazard ratio = 1.59, log-rank p-value <0.0001). AF recurrence was \n63.5% versus 42%, respectively. Recurrences of AF (including absence of conversion) were more \nfrequent in the dronedarone group, whereas premature study drug discontinuations due to intolerance \nwere more frequent in the amiodarone group. The incidence of the main safety endpoint defined as the \noccurrence of thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary, neurological, skin, eye or gastrointestinal specific events or \npremature study drug discontinuation following any adverse event was reduced by 20% in the \ndronedarone group compared to the amiodarone group (p = 0.129). This reduction was driven by the \noccurrence of significantly fewer thyroid and neurological events and a trend for less skin or ocular \nevents, and fewer premature study drug discontinuations compared to the amiodarone group. \nMore gastrointestinal adverse events, mainly diarrhoea, were observed in the dronedarone group \n(12.9% versus 5.1%). \n \nPatients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion within the previous month or \nwho were hospitalised for heart failure during the previous month \nThe ANDROMEDA study was conducted in 627 patients with left ventricular dysfunction, \nhospitalised with new or worsening heart failure and who had had at least one episode of shortness of \nbreath on minimal exertion or at rest (NYHA class III or IV) or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea within \nthe month before admission. Patients ranged in age from 27 to 96 years, 68% were more than 65 years \nold. The study was stopped prematurely due to an observed imbalance of deaths in the dronedarone \ngroup [n = 25 versus 12 (placebo), p = 0.027] (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nPatients with permanent atrial fibrillation \nThe PALLAS study was a randomised placebo-controlled study investigating the clinical benefit of \ndronedarone 400 mg BID on top of standard therapy in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and \nadditional risk factors (patients with congestive heart failure ~ 69%, coronary heart disease ~ 41%, \nprior stroke or TIA ~ 27%; LVEF ≤40% ~ 20.7% and patients ≥75 years with hypertension and \ndiabetes ~ 18%). The study was prematurely stopped after randomization of 3,149 patients \n(placebo = 1,577; dronedarone = 1,572) due to the significant increase in heart failure (placebo = 33; \ndronedarone = 80; HR = 2.49 (1.66-3.74)]; stroke [placebo = 8; dronedarone = 17; HR = 2.14 \n(0.92-4.96)] and cardiovascular death [placebo = 6; dronedarone = 15; HR = 2.53 (0.98-6.53)] (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration in fed condition, dronedarone is well absorbed (at least 70%). However \ndue to presystemic first pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability of dronedarone (given with food) \nis 15%. Concomitant intake of food increases dronedarone bioavailability by on average 2- to 4-fold. \nAfter oral administration in fed conditions, peak plasma concentrations of dronedarone and the main \ncirculating active metabolite (N-debutyl metabolite) are reached within 3 to 6 hours. After repeated \nadministration of 400 mg twice daily, steady state is reached within 4 to 8 days of treatment and the \nmean accumulation ratio for dronedarone ranges from 2.6 to 4.5. The steady state mean dronedarone \nCmax is 84-147 ng/ml and the exposure of the main N-debutyl metabolite is similar to that of the parent \ncompound. The pharmacokinetics of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite both deviate \nmoderately from dose proportionality: a 2-fold increase in dose results in an approximate 2.5- to \n3.0-fold increase with respect to Cmax and AUC. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite is 99.7% and 98.5% \nrespectively and is not saturable. Both compounds bind mainly to albumin. After intravenous \nadministration the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) ranges from 1,200 to 1,400 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDronedarone is extensively metabolised, mainly by CYP 3A4 (see section 4.5). The major metabolic \npathway includes N-debutylation to form the main circulating active metabolite followed by \noxidation, oxidative deamination to form the inactive propanoic acid metabolite, followed by \noxidation, and direct oxidation. Monoamine Oxidases contribute partially to the metabolism of the \nactive metabolite of dronedarone (see section 4.5).  \nThe N-debutyl metabolite exhibits pharmacodynamic activity but is 3 to 10-times less potent than \ndronedarone. This metabolite contributes to the pharmacological activity of dronedarone in humans. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter oral administration, approximately 6% of the labelled dose is excreted in urine mainly as \nmetabolites (no unchanged compound excreted in urine) and 84% are excreted in faeces mainly as \nmetabolites. After intravenous administration the plasma clearance of dronedarone ranges from 130 to \n150 L/h. The terminal elimination half-life of dronedarone is around 25-30 hours and that of its \nN-debutyl metabolite around 20-25 hours. In patients, dronedarone and its metabolite are completely \neliminated from the plasma within 2 weeks after the end of a 400 mg twice daily-treatment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of dronedarone in patients with AF is consistent with that in healthy subjects. \nGender, age and weight are factors that influence the pharmacokinetics of dronedarone. Each of these \nfactors has a limited influence on dronedarone. \n \nGender \nIn female patients, dronedarone exposures and its N-debutyl metabolite exposure are on average \n1.3- to 1.9-fold higher as compared to male patients. \n \nElderly  \nOf the total number of subjects in clinical studies of dronedarone, 73% were 65 years of age and over \nand 34% were 75 years of age and over. In patients aged 65 years of age and over, dronedarone \nexposures are 23% higher in comparison with patients aged below 65 years of age. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, dronedarone unbound exposure is increased by 2-fold. \nThe mean exposure of the N-debutyl metabolite is decreased by 47% (see section 4.2).  \nThe effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of dronedarone was not assessed (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of renal impairment on dronedarone pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated in a specific \nstudy. Renal impairment is not expected to modify the pharmacokinetics of dronedarone because no \nunchanged compound was excreted in urine and only approximately 6% of the dose was excreted in \nurine as metabolites (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDronedarone had no genotoxic effects, based on one in vivo micronucleus test in mice and four in vitro \ntests. \nIn 2-year oral carcinogenicity studies, the highest dronedarone dose administered for 24 months was \n70 mg/kg/day in rats and 300 mg/kg/day in mice. \nObservations were increased incidence of mammary gland tumors in female mice, histiocytic \nsarcomas in mice and hemangiomas at the mesenteric lymph node level in rats, all at the highest tested \ndose only (corresponding to an exposure of 5 to 10 times that of the human therapeutic dose). \nHemangiomas are not precancerous changes and do not transform into malignant hemangiosarcomas \nin either animals or man. None of these observations was considered relevant for humans. \n \nIn chronic toxicity studies, slight and reversible phospholipidosis (accumulation of foamy \nmacrophages) was observed in mesenteric lymph nodes mainly in the rat. This effect is considered \nspecific to this species and not relevant to humans. \n \nDronedarone caused marked effects on embryo-foetal development at high doses in rats, such as \nincreased post-implantation losses, reduced foetal and placental weights, and external, visceral and \nskeletal malformations. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What MULTAQ is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take MULTAQ \n3. How to take MULTAQ \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store MULTAQ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What MULTAQ is and what it is used for \n \nMULTAQ contains an active substance named dronedarone. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nanti-arrhythmics that help regulate your heart beat. \n \nMULTAQ is used if you have a problem with your heart rhythm (your heart beats out of time - atrial \nfibrillation) and spontaneously, or through a treatment called cardioversion has changed your heartbeat \nback to normal rhythm.  \nMULTAQ prevents repetition of your problem of irregular heart rhythm. MULTAQ is used only in \nadults. \n \nYour doctor will consider all available treatment options before prescribing MULTAQ to you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take MULTAQ \n \nDo not take MULTAQ: \n \n- if you are allergic to dronedarone or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6), \n- if you have a problem with the nerves in your heart (heart block). Your heart might beat very \n\nslowly or you may feel dizzy. If you have had a pacemaker fitted for this problem, you can use \nMULTAQ,  \n\n- if you have a very slow heart beat (less than 50 beats a minute), \n- if your ECG (electrocardiogram) shows a heart problem called “prolonged QT corrected \n\ninterval” (this interval is more than 500 milliseconds), \n- if you have a type of atrial fibrillation called permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). In permanent \n\nAF, the AF has been present for a long time (at least during 6 months) and a decision has been \nmade not to change back your heart rhythm to atrial normal rhythm with a treatment called \ncardioversion, \n\n- if you have instability (drops) in your blood pressure which can lead to inadequate arterial blood \nflow to your organs, \n\n\n\n29 \n\n- if you have or had a problem where your heart cannot pump the blood round your body as well \nas it should (condition called heart failure). You may have swollen feet or legs, trouble \nbreathing when lying down or sleeping, or shortness of breath when moving around,  \n\n- if the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts is too low (condition called \nleft ventricular dysfunction), \n\n- if you took amiodarone (another antiarrhythmic medicine) previously and experienced lung or \nliver problems, \n\n- if you take medicines for infection (including fungal infection or AIDS), allergies, heart beat \nproblems, depression, after a transplant (see section below on “Other medicines and \nMULTAQ”. This will give you more details on exactly what medicines you cannot take with \nMULTAQ), \n\n- if you have a severe liver problem, \n- if you have a severe kidney problem, \n- if you take dabigatran (see section below on “Other medicines and MULTAQ”). \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, do not take MULTAQ.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking MULTAQ if \n you have a problem that gives you a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood. This \n\nproblem should be corrected before starting treatment with MULTAQ, \n you are more than 75 years old, \n you have a condition when the vessel that supplies blood to heart muscle becomes hardened and \n\nnarrowed (coronary artery disease). \n \nWhile taking MULTAQ, tell your doctor if  \n your atrial fibrillation becomes permanent while you are taking MULTAQ. You should stop \n\ntaking MULTAQ, \n you have swollen feet or legs, trouble breathing when lying down or sleeping, shortness of \n\nbreath when moving around, or weight increase (which are signs and symptoms of heart \nfailure), \n\n tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: \nstomach (abdominal) area pain or discomfort, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, yellowing of \nthe skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), unusual darkening of the urine, fatigue (especially \nin association with other symptoms listed above), itching, \n\n you have breathlessness or non-productive cough. Tell your doctor, he/she will check your lung. \n \nIf this applies to you (or you are not sure), please talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nMULTAQ.  \n \nHeart, lung and blood tests \nWhile you are taking MULTAQ, your doctor may perform tests to check your medical condition and \nhow the medicine is working for you. \n Your doctor may look at your heart’s electrical activity using an ECG (electrocardiogram) \n\nmachine. \n Your doctor will order blood tests to check your liver function before you start taking \n\nMULTAQ and during treatment.  \n If you are taking some medicines against blood clot formation such as warfarin, your doctor will \n\norder a blood test called INR to check how well your medicine is working.  \n Your doctor may also do other blood tests. The results of one of the blood tests to check kidney \n\nfunction (blood creatinine levels) may be changed by MULTAQ. Your doctor will take this into \naccount when checking your blood levels and will use another reference of the “normal” value \nof blood creatinine.  \n\n Your doctor may check your lungs. \nIn some cases, MULTAQ treatment may need to be stopped. \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPlease tell any other person who checks your blood that you are taking MULTAQ. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nMULTAQ is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.  \n \nOther medicines and MULTAQ \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nYour doctor may recommend that you use a medicine against blood clot formation according to your \ncondition.  \n \nMULTAQ and some other medicines can affect each other and cause serious side effects. Your doctor \nmay change the dose of any other medicines you are taking. \n \nYou must not take any of the following with MULTAQ: \n other medicines used to control an irregular or fast heart beat such as flecainide, propafenone, \n\nquinidine, disopyramide, dofetilide, sotalol, amiodarone, \n some medicines for fungal infections such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole or \n\nposaconazole, \n some medicines for depression called tricyclic antidepressants,  \n some tranquilising medicines called phenothiazines, \n bepridil for chest pain caused by heart disease, \n telithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin (antibiotics for infections), \n terfenadine (a medicine for allergies), \n nefazodone (a medicine for depression),  \n cisapride (a medicine for food and acid reflux from your stomach to your mouth), \n ritonavir (a medicine for AIDS infection), \n dabigatran (a medicine for prevention of blood clot formation). \n \nYou must tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n other medicines for high blood pressure, for chest pain caused by heart disease, or other heart \n\nproblems, such as verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, metoprolol, propranolol or digoxin, \n some medicines for reducing the cholesterol in your blood (such as simvastatin, lovastatin, \n\natorvastatin, or rosuvastatin),  \n some medicines against blood clot formation such as warfarin, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and \n\napixaban. \n some medicines for epilepsy called phenobarbital, carbamazepine or phenytoin, \n sirolimus, tacrolimus, everolimus and cyclosporine (used after a transplant), \n St John’s Wort - a herbal medicine for depression, \n rifampicin - for tuberculosis. \n \nMULTAQ with food and drink \nDo not drink grapefruit juice while taking MULTAQ.

The increased bleeding risk resolved after \ndiscontinuation of dronedarone while rivaroxaban use continued. \n\nThe non-interventional retrospective cohort study (DRONEC09460) evaluating the “Concomitant \nUse of Dronedarone and Direct Oral Anticoagulants and the Risk of Major Bleeding in Patients \nwith Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation” reported an increased risk of major bleeding, driven by GI \nbleeding with concomitant use of rivaroxaban with dronedarone compared to those taking \nrivaroxaban alone. For both dabigatran and rivaroxaban, major bleeding was higher among those \ntaking dronedarone and dabigatran/rivaroxaban concomitantly compared to those taking \ndabigatran/rivaroxaban alone. This increased bleeding risk was not seen with concomitant use of \napixaban and dronedarone, but this could be explained by the different non-metabolic clearance of \napixaban that reduces the potential for drug-drug interaction. \n\nLiterature shows that in vitro there might be an 31% increase in rivaroxaban exposure due to \ninhibition of metabolism by dronedarone. A physiological based pharmacokinetic model showed a \nweak to moderate increase of the AUC of rivaroxaban in combination with dronedarone. \n\nIn relation to non-vit K antagonist regarding concomitant use with dronedarone the European Heart \nRhythm Association guide 2018 states: \"There are no interaction pharmacokinetic data available for \nrivaroxaban and apixaban but effects on their plasma levels can be anticipated based on P-gp and \nCYP3A4 interactions, calling for caution (i.e. ‘yellow’) or avoidance (for rivaroxaban).\"  \n\nFurthermore, the SmPC of rivaroxaban mentions that active substances strongly inhibiting only one \nof the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either CYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase \nrivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. Dronedarone is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor \nand a moderate -strong Pgp inhibitor.  \n\nIn view of available data, concomitant use of dronedarone and rivaroxaban is expected to increase \nthe plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban. The interaction may not be clinically relevant in most \npatients but could be significant in high-risk patients. Based on similar mechanism of action, the \nsame can be expected for apixaban and edoxaban. As the level of evidence for drug-drug \ninteractions between dronedarone and the different DOACs leading to increased exposure of the \nDOAC varies, slightly different recommendations on concomitant use with the different DOACs in \nsection 4.5 of SmPC are recommended. A warning is also included in the corresponding part of the \nPackage leaflet. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for dronedarone the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dronedarone is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information \n\n\n\n37 \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
