PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nPowder vial: \nWhite to off-white lyophilisate. \n \nSolvent bottle: \nClear isotonic solution (295 mOsml/l, pH approx. 7.4). \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nSavene is indicated in adults for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nSavene must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of anti-\ncancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \nTreatment should be given once daily for 3 consecutive days. The recommended dose is: \nDay 1: 1000 mg/m2 \nDay 2: 1000 mg/m2 \nDay 3:   500 mg/m2 \n \nThe first infusion should be initiated as soon as possible, within the first six hours after the accident. \nTreatment Day 2 and Day 3 should start at the same hour (+/- 3 hours) as Day 1. \n \nFor patients with a body surface area of more than 2 m2 the single dose should not exceed 2000 mg. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 mL/min) the Savene \ndose should be reduced by 50% (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \nDexrazoxane has not been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and its use in such \npatients is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly \nSafety and efficacy have not been evaluated in the elderly and the use of dexrazoxane in such patients \nis not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Savene in children below the age of 18 years have not been established and \nno data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use after reconstitution and dilution. \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \nThe indicated dose should be administered as an intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours into a large vein \nof an extremity or area other than the one affected by the extravasation. Cooling procedures such as \nice packs should have been removed from the area at least 15 minutes before the Savene \nadministration in order to allow sufficient blood flow. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Women of childbearing potential not using contraceptive measures (see section 4.6). \n\u2022 Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n\u2022 Concomitant vaccination with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nContinuous monitoring \nLocal examination should be performed on a regular basis after treatment until resolution. \n \nIf there is suspicion of extravasation by vesicant compounds other than anthracyclines through the \nsame IV access, e.g. vincristine, mitomycin, and vinorelbine, Savene would not be effective against \nthe effects from these compounds. \n \nSince Savene will be administered to patients undergoing cytotoxic therapy with anthracyclines its \ncytotoxic potential (especially resulting in reversible haematological toxicity with a nadir occurring on \ndays 11-12) will therefore add to that of the other chemotherapy administered. Haematological \nmonitoring should therefore be undertaken regularly. \n \nHepatic and renal-function monitoring \nSince liver dysfunction (increases in transaminases and bilirubin) may occur (especially after doses of \nabove 1 000 mg/m2 dexrazoxane), it is recommended that routine liver function tests be performed \nbefore each administration of dexrazoxane in patients with known liver function disorders (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nSince renal dysfunction may decrease the rate of elimination of dexrazoxane, patients with impaired \nrenal function should be monitored for signs of haematological toxicity (see section 4.2 for dosing \nrecommendations in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<40 mL/min)). \n \nAnaphylactic reaction \nAnaphylactic reaction including angioedema, skin reactions, bronchospasm, respiratory distress, \nhypotension and loss of consciousness have been observed in patients treated with dexrazoxane and \n\n\n\n4 \n\nanthracyclines (see section 4.8). Previous history of allergy to dexrazoxane should be carefully \nconsidered prior to administration (see section 4.3). \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nSince dexrazoxane possesses mutagenic activity and is used with anthracyclines known to have \ncytotoxic, mutagenic and embryotoxic properties, both sexually active men and women of \nchildbearing potential should be advised not to father a child/become pregnant and must use effective \ncontraceptive measures during and up to 6 months after treatment. Women must inform their doctor \nimmediately if they become pregnant (see section 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nPotassium and sodium contents \nSavene solvent contains 98 mg potassium per 500 ml bottle. This must be taken into consideration by \npatients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. Plasma potassium \nlevel must be closely monitored in patients at risk of hyperkalaemia. \nSavene solvent also contains 1.61 g sodium per 500 ml bottle, equivalent to 81% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated:  \nYellow fever vaccine: Risk of fatal generalised vaccinial disease (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended:  \n\u2022 Other live attenuated vaccines: risk of systemic, possible fatal disease. This risk is increased in \n\nsubjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease or by concomitant \nchemotherapy. Use an inactivated vaccine where this exists (poliomyelitis). \n\n\u2022 Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) should not be used in patients who are administered dexrazoxane to \ntreat anthracycline extravasation (see section 5.3) \n\n\u2022 Phenytoin: cytotoxic agents may reduce the absorption of phenytoin leading to an exacerbation \nof convulsions. Dexrazoxane is not recommended in combination with phenytoin. \n\n \nConcomitant use to assess carefully: \nCiclosporin, tacrolimus: Excessive immunosuppression with risk of lymphoproliferative disease. \n \nInteractions common to all cytotoxics: \n\u2022 Due to an increased thrombotic risk in patients with malignant diseases, the use of \n\nanticoagulants treatment is frequent. Patients treated with anticoagulants should be monitored \nmore frequently as cytotoxic agents may interact with oral anticoagulants. \n\n\u2022 Dexrazoxane may add to the toxicity induced by the chemotherapy cycle during which the \naccident took place, requiring careful monitoring of haematological parameters (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \nInteraction specific to dexrazoxane: \nWhen tested in five major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4, none of these were inhibited by dexrazoxane. \n \nCo-administration of doxorubicin (50 to 60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (60 to 100 mg/m2) did not affect \ndexrazoxane pharmacokinetics significantly.  In studies, dexrazoxane did not affect the \npharmacokinetics of doxorubicin. There is limited evidence from studies that suggests epirubicin \nclearance may be increased when dexrazoxane is pre-administered, this occurred at high doses of \nepirubicin (120-135 mg/m2).  Note that in these studies dexrazoxane was administered prior to \nanthracyline administration. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  \nSince dexrazoxane possesses mutagenic activity and is used with anthracyclines known to have \ncytotoxic, mutagenic and embryotoxic properties, both sexually active men and women of \nchildbearing potential should be advised not to father a child/become pregnant and must use effective \ncontraceptive measures during and up to 6 months after treatment. Women must inform their doctor \nimmediately if they become pregnant (see section 4.3). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of dexrazoxane in pregnant women. Dexrazoxane may cause foetal \nharm when administered to pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). Dexrazoxane should not be administered to pregnant women unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether dexrazoxane is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \nadverse reactions in breast-fed infants exposed to dexrazoxane, breast-feeding is contraindicated \nduring Savene therapy (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are limited fertility data from animal studies available, but testicular changes were observed in \nrats and rabbits following repeat dosing (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDizziness, somnolence and syncope have been reported in a few patients included in Savene studies \nTT01 and TT02 (see section 4.8). Dexrazoxane has minor influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines.  \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nA number of published reports comprising more than 1000 patients have demonstrated a uniform \npattern of dose dependent adverse reactions. Most common adverse reactions are nausea/vomiting, \nbone marrow suppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), injection site reactions, diarrhoea, \nstomatitis and increase in hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST). All adverse reactions have been rapidly \nreversible. \n \nThe following information is based on two clinical studies, TT01 and TT02, of Savene administered to \nextravasation patients already receiving cycles of chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nThe adverse reactions were those typically seen with standard chemotherapy and also with \ndexrazoxane: Nausea/vomiting in about one third of the patients, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in \nabout half of the patients, more rarely increased concentration of liver enzymes (ALT/AST). \nAdverse reactions observed in the two studies are listed below. \n \nIncidence of adverse reactions (MedDRA) in studies TT01 and TT02 (n=80 patients)  \n(Note that numbers for Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders are described in a separate table of \nlaboratory examinations) \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem Organ Classes (SOC) Frequency  Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations Very common Postoperative infection \n\nCommon Infection \nNeutropenic infection \n\nImmune system disorders Not known Anaphylactic reactions \n Not known Hypersensitivity \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common Decreased appetite \nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \n  Sensory loss \n  Syncope \n  Tremor \nVascular disorders Common Phlebitis \n  Superficial thrombophlebitis  \n  Venous thrombosis limb \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\n  Pneumonia \nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea \n Common Vomiting \n  Diarrhoea \n  Stomatitis \n  Dry mouth \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Alopecia \n\n  Pruritus \nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nCommon Myalgia \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nCommon Vaginal haemorrhage \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common Injection site pain \n\n Common Pyrexia \n  Injection site phlebitis \n  Injection site erythema \n  Fatigue \n  Injection site induration \n  Injection site swelling \n  Peripheral oedema  \n  Somnolence \nInvestigations Common Weight decreased \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\nCommon Wound complication \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIncidence of laboratory abnormalities in TT01 and TT02 (n=80 patients) \n\nLab test \nNo of patients with \npost baseline value \n\nCTC grade 3-4 \nN % \n\nHaemoglobin 80 2 2.5% \nWBC 80 36 45.0% \nNeutrophils 78 36 46.2% \nPlatelets 80 17 21.3% \nSodium (Hypo) 79 5 6.3% \nPotassium (Hypo) 79 2 2.5% \nPotassium (Hyper) 79 0 0.0% \nAlkaline Phosphatase 77 0 0.0% \nBilirubin 77 1 1.3% \nAST 57 2 3.5% \nALT 71 3 3.9% \nCreatinine 76 2 2.6% \nLDH 78 0 0.0% \nCalcium Total (Hypo) 28 2 7.1% \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reaction via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms of overdosage are likely to consist of leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, skin reactions and alopecia. Treatment should be symptomatic. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic agents, ATC code: V03AF02 \n \nTwo pharmacodynamic properties of dexrazoxane are described in the literature:  \n1. Prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity, and \n2. Antineoplastic action \n \nMechanism of action \nDexrazoxane has two major mechanisms of action: \n1. Chelation of iron, especially through its ring-opened metabolite thus reducing the iron-\n\ndependent oxidative stress causing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. \n2. Inhibition of topoisomerase II. \n \nIt is not known to what extent each of these mechanisms contributes to the preventive effect on tissue \ndestruction following anthracycline extravasation. \n \nThe chelating property is probably also responsible for an increased urinary excretion of iron and zinc \nand a decreased serum concentration of calcium as described in a few studies. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe clinical programme for Savene (dexrazoxane) included two open, single-arm, multicentre studies. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nThe overall purpose of each trial was to investigate the efficacy of intravenous Savene in preventing \ntissue damage from accidentally extravasated anthracycline, and thus preventing the patients from \nundergoing the routinely used surgical excision of the affected tissue. \n \nDue to the rarity of the condition only historical data could be used for comparison (demonstrating \nsurgical rates of 35-50 %, in one country 100% in biopsy proven cases). \n \nIn both studies the dosage regimen was the same. Treatment with Savene had to be started within \n6 hours from the incident and was repeated after 24 and 48 hours. The first and second doses were \n1000 mg/m2 and the third was 500 mg/m2. \n \nA requirement for inclusion in the efficacy part of the study was that the anthracycline extravasation \nwas proven by fluorescence microscopy of one or more biopsies. \n \nFor study purposes, patients with extravasations from a central venous access device (CVAD) were \nnot included in the efficacy evaluation. \n \nPatients with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia > CTC grade 1 (Common Toxicity Criteria) have not \nbeen included in the clinical studies. \n \nIn study TT01, 23 patients were entered and received treatment with Savene. Eighteen were evaluable \nfor efficacy and safety and a further five patients were evaluable for toxicity only. None of the patients \nrequired surgical intervention. \n \nIn study TT02, 57 patients entered the study and received the first dose of Savene. 36 patients were \nevaluable for efficacy. Only one of the 36 patients required surgery. \n \nIn both studies all patients had received anthracycline. Overall, the most commonly received \nanthracycline was epirubicin (56 % of the patients). \n \nIn both studies dexrazoxane treatment prevented the development of necrosis, allowed cancer \ntreatment to continue as scheduled in the majority of patients (70.4 %), and reduced the occurrence of \nsequelae (only few and mild long-term sequelae were observed). \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSavene must only be administered intravenously. \n \nDistribution \nBibliographical data demonstrate that serum kinetics of dexrazoxane after intravenous administration \nfollow an open two-compartment model independent of schedule and dose. The apparent volumes of \ndistribution are 0.13-1.3 l/kg (median 0.49 l/kg). Volume of distribution is independent of dose. AUCs \nwere dose-proportional. Tissue distribution is rapid, with the highest levels of unchanged parent \ncompound and hydrolysed product appearing in liver and kidneys. About 2% of dexrazoxane is \nprotein-bound. \n \nBiotransformation \nDexrazoxane undergoes intracellular hydrolysis first to its two one-ring open intermediates (B and C) \nand then to the two-ring opened form (ADR-925) which has a structure similar to EDTA and is a \nstrong chelator of iron and divalent cations as calcium ions. \n \nElimination \nDexrazoxane displays biphasic elimination kinetics. Initial elimination half lives (alpha) are 0.18-1 h \n(median 0.34 h) and terminal elimination half lives 1.9-9.1 h (median 2.8 h). Total urinary recovery of \nunchanged dexrazoxane is 34-60 %. Systemic clearance is independent of dose. The pharmacokinetics \nof the metabolites is derived from a single study with five patients. The mean elimination half-lives of \nthe one-ring opened metabolite B and metabolite C are 0.9-3.9 h (n=5) and 0.5-0.8 h (n=3), \n\n\n\n9 \n\nrespectively. The elimination half-life of the two-ring opened metabolite ADR-925 is not given in \nliterature. ADR-925 is reported to increase three-fold within 15 min after infusion of 1500 mg/m2 and \nremain relatively constant on a plateau for 4 hours and then decreased to about half at 24 hours.  \n \nIn-vitro studies on dexrazoxane in human microsomes have shown high stability of dexrazoxane \nindicating that major metabolism via cytochrome P450 is unlikely. \n \nThere is insufficient data available to draw any definite conclusions regarding intrinsic pharmaco-\nkinetic factors such as age, gender, race and weight. Inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic \nvariabilities have not been studied systematically. Based on a limited number of patients, inter-\nindividual variability calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV %) was estimated to be \napproximately 30 % for the main pharmacokinetic parameters. \n \nRenal impairment \nCompared with normal subjects (creatinine clearance (CLCR) >80 mL/min), exposure was 2- fold \ngreater in subjects with moderate (CLCR of 30 to 50 mL/min) to severe (CLCR <30 mL/min) renal \nimpairment. Modelling suggested that equivalent exposure (AUC0-inf) could be achieved if dosing were \nreduced by 50% in subjects with CLCR less than 40 mL/min compared with control subjects (CLCR \n>80 mL/min) (see section 4.2). \n \nPharmacokinetics in patients with extravasations \nClinical trial TT04 was conducted on 6 female patients undergoing treatment for anthracycline \nextravasations. The aim was to examine the pharmacokinetics of a 3-day dosing regimen of \ndexrazoxane and its efficacy in patients for anthracycline extravasation. The systemic clearances were \nsimilar between day 1 (9.9 L/h \u00b1 3.1) and day 2 (11.1 L/h \u00b1 4.5), and did not differ from those \nreported in the literature. The steady-state volume of distribution of dexrazoxane was 30.5 L \u00b1 11.1 for \nday 1 and 35.8 L \u00b1 19.7 for day 2. The terminal elimination half-life was consistent throughout days \n1 - 3 (2.1 - 2.2 h). The mean AUC0-24 values for day 1 and day 2 were comparable with each other, and \nthe AUC0-last at day 3 was approximately half that of the first two days, suggesting that the \npharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane are dose-dependent. The overall ranges and mean of AUC0-24 \nbetween days were very similar; it does not appear that there is any significant accumulation of \ndexrazoxane. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies with dexrazoxane have shown that primary target organs were tissues that \nundergo rapid cell division: bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, testes and digestive tract. \nMyelosuppression is thus common. The apparent effects were greater during chronic than acute \nadministration. The toxicity in combination with doxorubicin was additive and not synergistic. \nDexrazoxane has been shown to possess mutagenic activity. The carcinogenic potential of \ndexrazoxane has not been investigated, however, razoxane (the racemic mixture of dexrazoxane and \nlevrazoxane) has been reported to be associated with the development of malignancies in mice \n(lymphoid neoplasms) and rats (uterine carcinomas) after administration for a prolonged period of \ntime. Both of these effects are expected for this class of compound. \n \nThere are limited fertility data from animal studies available, but testicular changes were observed in \nrats and rabbits following repeat dosing. \n \nThe related razoxane has been demonstrated to be embryotoxic in mice, rats and rabbits and \nteratogenic in rats and mice. \n \nWhen mice with experimental daunorubicin extravasation were treated with dexrazoxane systemically \ncombined with topical treatment with DMSO on the daunorubicin-affected skin area, 67 % of the mice \ndeveloped small skin wounds, whereas dexrazoxane treatment alone completely prevented the \ndaunorubicin-induced skin necrosis in another group of mice.  Thus, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) \nshould not be used in patients who are administered dexrazoxane to treat anthracycline extravasation. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n23 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nSavene 20 mg/ml powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion \nDexrazoxane \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See Section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Savene is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Savene \n3. How to use Savene \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Savene \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Savene is and what it is used for \n \nSavene contains the active substance dexrazoxane, which acts as an antidote to anti-cancer medicines \ncalled anthracyclines. \n \nMost anti-cancer medicines are administered intravenously (into a vein). Occasionally an accident \noccurs and the medicine is infused outside the vein and into the surrounding tissue or leaks from the \nvein into the surrounding tissue. This event is called extravasation. It is a serious complication as it \ncan cause severe tissue damage. \n \nSavene is used to treat anthracyline extravasation in adults. It can reduce the amount of tissue damage \ncaused by anthracycline extravasation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Savene \n \nDo not use Savene: \n- If you are allergic to dexrazoxane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- If you are planning to become pregnant and do not use adequate contraceptive measures \n- If you are breast-feeding \n- If you are given yellow-fever vaccine \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Savene: \n- Savene should only be given to you if you have an extravasation in connection with \n\nanthracycline-containing chemotherapy. \n- During treatment with Savene the area where the extravasation has occurred will be examined \n\non a regular basis and you will have blood tests taken regularly to check your blood cells. \n- If you have liver problems, your doctor will monitor your liver function during treatment. \n- If you have kidney problems, your doctor will monitor for signs of changes to your blood cells. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nSavene should not be administered to children below the age of 18 years. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nOther medicines and Savene \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or may take any of the following medicines: \n- Vaccines: you must not use Savene if you are going to receive yellow fever vaccine and it is not \n\nrecommended that you use Savene if you are going to receive a vaccine containing live virus \nparticles. \n\n- A product called DMSO (which is a cream to treat some skin diseases). \n- Phenytoin (a treatment against seizures) (Savene may reduce the effectiveness of this medicine). \n- Anticoagulants (blood thinners) (your blood may need to be monitored more frequently). \n- Ciclosporin or tacrolimus (both treatments lower the body's immune system and are used to \n\nprevent organ rejection after an organ transplant). \n- Myelosuppressive medicines (decrease production of red, white, or coagulating blood cells). \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \nSavene should not be administered if you are pregnant.  \nYou must not breast-feed while you are treated with Savene. \nIf you are sexually active, you are advised to use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy during \nand for six months after treatment, whether you are male or female  (see section 2 \u2018Do not use \nSavene\u2019). \nThere is limited information about the effect of Savene on fertility \u2013 if you have a concern about this \nspeak to you doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness, tiredness and sudden fainting have been reported in a few patients treated with Savene. The \ntreatment is considered to have a limited influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nSavene contains potassium and sodium \nThe Savene solvent contains 98 mg potassium in each 500 ml bottle which may be harmful to people \non a low-potassium diet or who have kidney problems. If you are at risk of high potassium levels in \nyour blood, your doctor will monitor this. \nSavene solvent also contains 1.61 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 500 ml \nbottle.  This is equivalent to 81% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an \nadult. \n \n \n3. How to use Savene \n \nSavene will be given to you under the control of a doctor experienced in the use of anti-cancer \ntreatments. \n \nRecommended dose \nThe dose will depend on your height, weight and kidney function. Your doctor will calculate your \nbody surface area in square meter (m2) to determine the dose you should receive. The recommended \nadult dose (with normal kidney function) is: \n \nDay 1:  1000 mg/m2  \nDay 2:  1000 mg/m2 \nDay 3:    500 mg/m2 \n \nYour doctor may reduce your dose if you have kidney problems. \nSavene will be given by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last 1-2 hours. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nFrequency of administration \nYou will receive your infusion once daily for 3 consecutive days. The first infusion will be given as \nsoon as possible and within the first six hours after extravasation of an anthracycline medicine. Savene \ninfusion will be given at the same time every day of your treatment. \nSavene will not be used again at the time of your next anthracycline cycle, except if extravasation \noccurs again. \n \nIf you receive more Savene than you should \nIf you receive more Savene than you should, you will be closely monitored with specific attention to \nyour blood cells, potential gastro-intestinal signs, skin reactions and hair loss.  \n \nIf Savene comes into contact with the skin, the affected area should immediately be rinsed thoroughly \nwith water. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSome side effects can be serious and need immediate medical attention.  \nThe following serious side effect has been reported in patients during treatment with Savene \n(frequency not known):  \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, symptoms of which could be itching (pruritis), rash, facial/throat swelling, \n\nwheezing, breathlessness or difficult breathing, changes in levels of consciousness, hypotension, \nsudden fainting \n\n \nIf you get any of the above symptoms, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nOther possible side effects are listed below: \n \nVery common:  may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Reactions at the site of injection (pain at the site, red, swollen or painful skin at the site or \n\nhardening of the skin at the site) \n\u2022 Reduction in the number of white blood cells and platelets \n\u2022 Infection (after an operation or other infections) \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Feeling tired, feeling sleepy, feeling dizzy, sudden fainting \n\u2022 Reduction in any of your senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste) \n\u2022 Fever \n\u2022 Inflammation of the blood vessel where the treatment is given (phlebitis) \n\u2022 Inflammation of a blood vessel just under the skin, often with a small blood clot \n\u2022 Blood clot in the vein, usually in an arm or leg \n\u2022 Inflammation in the mouth \n\u2022 Dry mouth \n\u2022 Hair loss \n\u2022 Itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 Weight loss, loss of appetite \n\u2022 Muscle pain, tremor (uncontrolled muscle movement) \n\u2022 Vaginal bleeding \n\u2022 Difficulties in breathing \n\n\n\n26 \n\n\u2022 Pneumonia (lung infection) \n\u2022 Swelling in arms or legs (oedema) \n\u2022 Wound complications \n\u2022 Changes in liver function (these may be seen in test results) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

FORMULATION \n \nSavene is supplied as: \n1. Savene powder for concentrate \n2. Solvent for Savene \n \nSavene powder must be reconstituted in 25 ml Savene solvent to obtain a concentrate that must be \nfurther diluted in the remaining Savene solvent prior to administration. \n \n \n2. RECOMMENDATION FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \nSavene is an anti-cancer agent and the normal procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-\ncancer medicines should be adopted, namely: \n- Personnel should be trained to reconstitute the medicine \n- Pregnant staff should be excluded from working with this medicine \n- Personnel handling this medicine during reconstitution should wear protective clothing \n\nincluding mask, goggles and gloves \n- Accidental contact with the skin or eyes should be treated immediately and thoroughly with \n\ncopious amounts of water \n \n \n3. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n \n3.1 Reconstitution of Savene powder to prepare a concentrate \n3.1.1 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, withdraw aseptically 25 ml from the Savene solvent bottle. \n3.1.2 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial containing the Savene powder. \n3.1.3  Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions until the powder is \n\nfully dissolved. Do not shake. \n3.1.4  Allow the vial with the concentrate to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature and check if the \n\nsolution is homogenous and clear. The concentrate is slightly yellow. \n The concentrate contains 20 mg dexrazoxane per ml and should be used immediately for further \n\ndilution. It contains no antibacterial preservative. \n3.1.5 Keep and store the opened solvent bottle under aseptic conditions because it is needed for \n\ndilution of the concentrate. \n \n3.2 Dilution of the concentrate \n3.2.1 Up to four vials containing Savene concentrate may be necessary to obtain the required dose for \n\nthe patient. Based on the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, withdraw aseptically the \ncorresponding volume containing 20 mg dexrazoxane per ml from the appropriate number of \nvials containing concentrate. Use a graduated syringe filled with a needle. \n\n3.2.2 Inject the required volume back into the opened Savene solvent bottle (see point 3.1.5). The \nsolution must not be mixed with any other medicines. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n3.2.3 Mix the solution by agitating gently the infusion bottle. \n3.2.4 Savene should be administered aseptically as a 1-2 hours infusion under room temperature and \n\nnormal light conditions. \n3.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Savene concentrate and infusion solution should be inspected \n\nvisually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Solutions containing a \nprecipitate should be discarded. \n\n \n \n4. STORAGE \n \n4.1 Before reconstitution and dilution: \n- Store below 25 \u00b0C. \n- Keep the powder vials and solvent bottles in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \n4.2 After reconstitution and dilution: \n- Chemical and physical in-use stability after reconstitution and subsequent dilution in the solvent \n\nhas been demonstrated for 4 hours when stored at 2 to 8 \u00b0C. \n- In order to avoid the potential contamination of the medicine by microbes, the product should \n\nbe used immediately. \n- If the medicine is not used immediately, it should be kept at a temperature of 2 to 8 \u00b0C (in the \n\nrefrigerator) and no longer than 4 hours. \n \n \n5. DISPOSAL \n \nAll items for preparation, administration or cleaning, including gloves, as well as liquid waste should \nbe disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
