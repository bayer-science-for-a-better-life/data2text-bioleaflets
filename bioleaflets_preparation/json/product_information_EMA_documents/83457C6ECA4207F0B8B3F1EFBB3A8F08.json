NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGlubrava 15 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 15 mg of pioglitazone (as hydrochloride) and 850 mg of metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nThe tablets are white to off-white, oblong, film-coated, embossed ‘15 / 850’ on one face and ‘4833M’ \non the other.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nGlubrava is indicated as second line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients, particularly \noverweight patients, who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally \ntolerated dose of oral metformin alone. \n \nAfter initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess \nadequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate \nresponse, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, \nprescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 mL/min) \nThe recommended dose of Glubrava is 30 mg/day pioglitazone plus 1,700 mg/day of metformin \nhydrochloride (this dose is achievable with one tablet of Glubrava 15 mg/850 mg, taken twice a day).  \n \nDose titration with pioglitazone (added to the optimal dose of metformin) should be considered before \nthe patient is switched to Glubrava. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, direct change from metformin monotherapy to Glubrava may be \nconsidered. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nAs metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal \nfunction, elderly patients taking Glubrava should have their renal function monitored regularly (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPhysicians should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually, \nparticularly when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and \ncardiac failure). \n \nRenal impairment \nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing products and at \nleast annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in \nthe elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g every 3-6 months. \n \nThe maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that \nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering \ninitiation of metformin in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min.  \nIf no adequate strength of Glubrava is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead \nof the fixed dose combination. \n \nGFR \nmL/min \n \n\nMetformin Pioglitazone \n\n60-89 Maximum daily dose is 3,000 mg  \nDose reduction may be considered in \nrelation to declining renal function. \n\n \n \n \nNo dose adjustment. \nMaximum daily dose is 45 mg \n \n \n\n45-59 Maximum daily dose is 2,000 mg \nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose. \n\n30-44 Maximum daily dose is 1,000 mg. \nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose. \n\n< 30 Metformin is contra-indicated \n \nHepatic impairment \nGlubrava should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Glubrava in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTablets should be swallowed with a glass of water. Taking Glubrava with, or just after food, may \nreduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with metformin. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nGlubrava is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) \n- Current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer  \n- Uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria \n- Acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as cardiac or respiratory failure, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, shock \n- Hepatic impairment \n- Acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism  \n- Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis) \n- Diabetic pre-coma \n- Severe renal failure (GFR < 30 mL/min) \n\n\n\n4 \n\n- Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: \n- Dehydration \n- Severe infection \n- Shock \n\n- Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4) \n- Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nThere is no clinical experience of pioglitazone in triple combination with other oral antidiabetic \nmedicinal products. \n \nLactic acidosis \n \nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.  \n \nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, heat, reduced fluid intake), Glubrava \nshould be temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) should be initiated with caution in metformin treated \npatients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, \ninadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with \nhypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic acidosis (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed on the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia \nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking Glubrava and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. \n \nRenal function \n \nGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter, see section 4.2. Metformin \nis contraindicated in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min and should be temporarily discontinued in the \npresence of conditions that alter renal function, see section 4.3. \n \nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive therapy or diuretic therapy and when starting treatment with a NSAID. \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \n \nPioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When \ntreating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e.g. \nprior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease or the elderly), physicians should \nstart with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually. Patients should be observed for \nsigns and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema; particularly those with reduced cardiac \nreserve. There have been post-marketing cases of cardiac failure reported when pioglitazone was used \nin combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Since insulin and \npioglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration of insulin and \nGlubrava may increase the risk of oedema. Post marketing cases of peripheral oedema and cardiac \nfailure have also been reported in patients with concomitant use of pioglitazone and nonsteroidal \n\n\n\n5 \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Glubrava should be discontinued if \nany deterioration in cardiac status occurs. \n \nA cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease. Pioglitazone or placebo was \nadded to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years. This study showed an \nincrease in reports of heart failure; however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.  \n \nElderly \n \nCombination use with insulin should be considered with caution in the elderly because of increased \nrisk of serious heart failure. \n \nIn light of age- related risks (especially bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure), the balance of \nbenefits and risks should be considered carefully both before and during treatment in the elderly. \n \nBladder cancer \n \nCases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials \nwith pioglitazone (19 cases from 12,506 patients, 0.15%) than in control groups (7 cases from \n10,212 patients, 0.07%) HR=2.64 (95% CI 1.11-6.31, p=0.029). After excluding patients in whom \nexposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were \n7 cases (0.06%) on pioglitazone and 2 cases (0.02%) in control groups. Epidemiological studies have \nalso suggested a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone, \nalthough not all studies identified a statistically significant increased risk. \n \nRisk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks \ninclude age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents \ne.g. cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region). Any macroscopic haematuria \nshould be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy.  \n \nPatients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if macroscopic haematuria \nor other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment. \n \nMonitoring of liver function \n \nThere have been rare reports of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction during \npost-marketing experience with pioglitazone (see section 4.8). Although in very rare cases fatal \noutcome has been reported, causal relationship has not been established. \nIt is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with Glubrava undergo periodic monitoring of liver \nenzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with Glubrava in all \npatients. Therapy with Glubrava should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver \nenzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 x upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease.  \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy with Glubrava, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored \nperiodically according to clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 x upper limit of normal \nduring Glubrava therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels \nremain > 3 x the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops \nsymptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision \nwhether to continue the patient on therapy with Glubrava should be guided by clinical judgement \npending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, the medicinal product should be discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nWeight gain \n \nIn clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due \nto fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increase \nmay be a symptom of cardiac failure; therefore weight should be closely monitored. \n \nHaematology \n \nThere was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% \nrelative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes \nwere seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6-4.1% relative reductions) treated \npatients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nPatients receiving pioglitazone in dual oral therapy with a sulphonylurea may be at risk for \ndose-related hypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea may be necessary. \n \nEye disorders \n \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should \nbe considered. \n \nSurgery \n \nAs Glubrava contains metformin hydrochloride, it must be discontinued at the time of surgery under \ngeneral, spinal or epidural anesthesia. Therapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following \nsurgery or resumption of oral nutrition and provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and \nfound to be stable. \n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent \n \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Glubrava should be \ndiscontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable, see sections 4.2 \nand 4.5. \n \nPolycystic ovarian syndrome \n \nAs a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic \novarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. \nPatients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if \npregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nOthers \n \nAn increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse reactions \nof bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n \nThe fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with \npioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator. The observed \n\n\n\n7 \n\nexcess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per \n100 patient years of use. \n \nSome epidemiological studies have suggested a similarly increased risk of fracture in both men and \nwomen. The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with \npioglitazone (see section 4.8). \n \nPioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 \ninhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored \nclosely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for Glubrava. The following statements reflect the \ninformation available on the individual active substances (pioglitazone and metformin). \n \nPioglitazone \n \nCo-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported \nto result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. Since there is a potential for an increase in \ndose-related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is \nconcomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see \nsection 4.4). Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) \nis reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The pioglitazone dose may need to be \nincreased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment. If necessary, the dose of the antihyperglycaemic \nmedicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its \ndiscontinuation. \n \nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels. If necessary, \nthe dose of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and on its discontinuation. \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Studies in man suggest \nno induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/9 and 3A4. In vitro studies have shown \nno inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450. Interactions with substances metabolised by these \nenzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blockers, and HMGCoA reductase \ninhibitors are not to be expected. \n \nMetformin \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nAlcohol \nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment.  \n \nIodinated contrast agents \nGlubrava must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until \nat least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable, see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCombinations requiring precautions for use \nSome medicinal products that can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDS, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such \nproducts in combination with Glubrava, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. \n \nCationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may \ninteract with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted \nin seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, \nincreased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring \nof glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n \nGlubrava is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If a patient \nwishes to become pregnant, treatment with Glubrava should be discontinued. \n \nPregnancy \n \nPioglitazone \nThere are no adequate human data from the use of pioglitazone in pregnant women. Studies of \npioglitazone in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. \n \nMetformin \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of metformin in pregnant women. Animal studies have \nnot revealed teratogenic effects or do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nGlubrava should not be used during pregnancy. If a pregnancy occurs, treatment with Glubrava should \nbe discontinued. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pioglitazone and metformin are excreted in human milk. Available \ntoxicological data in animals have shown excretion of pioglitazone and metformin in the milk of \nlactating rats (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nGlubrava is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal fertility studies with pioglitazone, there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or \nfertility index. \nFertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as \n600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose \nbased on body surface area comparisons. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGlubrava has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However patients \nwho experience visual disturbance should be cautious when driving or using machines. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials have been conducted with Glubrava tablets and co-administered pioglitazone and \nmetformin (see section 5.1). At the initiation of the treatment abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loss of \nappetite, nausea and vomiting may occur, these reactions are very common but usually disappear \nspontaneously in most cases. Lactic acidosis is a serious reaction which may occur very rarely \n(< 1/10,000) (see section 4.4) and other reactions such as bone fracture, weight increase and oedema \nmay occur commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) (see section 4.4).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported in double-blind studies and post-marketing experience are listed below as \nMedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing incidence \nfollowed by decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nAdverse reaction Frequency of adverse reactions \n Pioglitazone Metformin Glubrava \n\nInfections and infestations   \nupper respiratory tract infection common  common \nsinusitis uncommon  uncommon \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified \n(including cysts and polyps) \n\n \n\nbladder cancer uncommon  uncommon \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders   \nanaemia   common \nImmune System Disorders    \nhypersensitivity and allergic reactions1 not known  not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders     \nVitamin B12 absorption decreased2  very rare very rare \nlactic acidosis  very rare very rare \nNervous system disorders     \nhypo-aesthesia common  common \ninsomnia uncommon  uncommon \nheadache   common \ntaste disturbance  common common \nEye disorders   \nvisual disturbance3 common  common \nmacular oedema not known  not known \nGastrointestinal disorders4   \nabdominal pain  very \n\ncommon \nvery \n\ncommon \ndiarrhoea  very \n\ncommon \nvery \n\ncommon \nflatulence   uncommon \nloss of appetite  very \n\ncommon \nvery \n\ncommon \nnausea  very \n\ncommon \nvery \n\ncommon \nvomiting  very \n\ncommon \nvery \n\ncommon \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAdverse reaction Frequency of adverse reactions \n Pioglitazone Metformin Glubrava \n\nHepatobiliary disorders    \nhepatitis5  not known not known \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders    \nerythema  very rare very rare \npruritis  very rare very rare \nurticaria  very rare very rare \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders    \nbone fracture6 common  common \narthralgia   common \nRenal and urinary disorders     \nhaematuria   common \nReproductive system and breast disorders    \nerectile dysfunction   common \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions  \n\n   \n\noedema7   common \nInvestigations    \nweight increased8 common  common \nalanine aminotransferase increased9 not known  not known \nliver function tests abnormal5  not known not known \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n1 Postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with pioglitazone have been \nreported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria.  \n \n2 Long term treatment of metformin has been associated with a decrease of vitamin B12 absorption \nwith decrease of serum levels. Consideration of such aetiology is recommended if a patient presents \nwith megaloplastic anaemia. \n \n3 Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood \nglucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.  \n \n4 Gastrointestinal disorders occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve \nspontaneously in most cases. \n \n5 Isolated reports: liver function tests abnormalities or hepatitis resolving upon metformin \ndiscontinuation. \n \n6 A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised, \ncomparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8,100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated \ngroups and 7,400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration. A higher rate of \nfractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%). No increase in \nfracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%).  \nIn the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of \npioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per \n100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator. The observed excess risk of fractures for \nwomen on pioglitazone in this study is therefore 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years of use. No increase \nin fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). \nPost-marketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4). \n \n7 In active comparator controlled trials oedema was reported in 6.3% of patients treated with \nmetformin and pioglitazone, whereas the addition of sulphonylurea to metformin treatment resulted in \n\njavascript:%20OpenTerm%20('PT:10001551')\n\n\n11 \n\noedema in 2.2% of patients. The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did \nnot require discontinuation of treatment. \n \n8 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy \nwas 2-3 kg over one year. In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean \nweight increase over one year of 1.5 kg. \n \n9 In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the \nupper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea \ncomparator groups. Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone.  \n \nIn controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the \nsame as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used in \ncombination therapy with insulin. In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major \nmacrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than \nwith placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin. However, this did not lead to an increase in \nmortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher percentage \nof patients with heart failure was observed in patients aged ≥ 65 years compared with those less than \n65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the incidence of heart \nfailure was 8.2% in those ≥ 65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than 65 years. Heart failure has \nbeen reported with marketing use of pioglitazone and more frequently when pioglitazone was used in \ncombination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of \n45 mg daily. The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/day for four days, then 180 mg/day for seven \ndays was not associated with any symptoms.  \n \nA large overdose of metformin (or coexisting risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which \nis a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital. \n \nThe most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is haemodialysis.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD05. \n \nGlubrava combines two antihyperglycaemic active substances with complementary mechanisms of \naction to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pioglitazone, a member \nof the thiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. \nThiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and biguanides act primarily by \ndecreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nPioglitazone and metformin combination \n \nThe fixed dose combination tablet of pioglitazone 15 mg/metformin 850 mg BID (N=201), \npioglitazone 15 mg BID (N=189), and metformin 850 mg BID (N=210) were evaluated in type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus patients with mean baseline HbA1c of 9.5% in a randomised double-blind, \nparallel-group study. Previous anti-diabetic medicinal products were discontinued for 12 weeks prior \nto baseline measurements. After 24 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint of mean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c was -1.83% in the combination group versus -0.96% in the pioglitazone group \n(p< 0.0001) and -0.99% in the metformin group (p< 0.0001). \n \nThe safety profile seen in this study reflected the known adverse reactions seen with the individual \nproducts and did not suggest any new safety issues. \n \nPioglitazone \n \nPioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone appears to act \nvia activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading \nto increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals. Treatment with \npioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose \ndisposal in the case of insulin resistance. \n \nFasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma \ninsulin concentrations. A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to \ntwo years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥8.0% after the \nfirst six months of therapy). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients \ntreated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone. At two years, glycaemic control (defined as \nHbA1c <8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of \npatients on gliclazide. In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with \ngliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in \nHbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year. The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during \nthe second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide. \n \nIn a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin \noptimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months. Patients receiving \npioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin \nalone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group. \n \nHOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin \nsensitivity. Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect. \n \nIn one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the \nalbumin/creatinine ratio compared to baseline. \n \nThe effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in \ntype 2 diabetics. Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain. Visceral fat was \nsignificantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass. Similar changes in \nbody fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. \nIn most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased \nHDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically \nsignificant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels. In clinical trials of up to two years duration, \npioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-cholesterol \nlevels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide. Pioglitazone did not cause statistically \nsignificant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions where \nobserved with metformin and gliclazide. In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, \npioglitazone reduced postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and \n\n\n\n13 \n\nhepatically synthesised triglycerides. These effects were independent of pioglitazone’s effects on \nglycaemia and were statistically significantly different to glibenclamide. \n \nIn PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \npre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to \nexisting antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years. The study population had an \naverage age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Approximately one third of \npatients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea. To be eligible \npatients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous \ncardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, \nor peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial \ninfarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke. Approximately half of the study population had at \nleast two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria. Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving \ncardiovascular medicinal products (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium \nchannel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, acetylsalicylic acid, statins, fibrates). \n \nAlthough the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause \nmortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, \ncoronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term \ncardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone. However, the incidence of oedema, weight gain \nand heart failure were increased. No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed. \n \nMetformin \n \nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia.  \n \nMetformin may act via three mechanisms: \n \n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis  \n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \n\nutilisation \n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. \n \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin \nincreases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and \nGLUT-4). \n \nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels. \n \nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed: \n \n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: \nmetformin 7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: \nmetformin 13.5 events/1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years, \n(p=0.011), and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n18.9 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.021) \n\n\n\n14 \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: \nmetformin 11 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01). \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nGlubrava in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGlubrava \n \nBioequivalence studies in healthy volunteers have shown Glubrava to be bioequivalent to the \nadministration of pioglitazone and metformin given as separate tablets. \n \nFood had no effect on the AUC and Cmax of pioglitazone when Glubrava was administered to healthy \nvolunteers. However, in the case of metformin, in the fed state the mean AUC and Cmax were lower \n(13% and 28% respectively). Tmax was delayed by food by approximately 1.9 h for pioglitazone and \n0.8 h for metformin. \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nGlubrava. \n \nPioglitazone \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of \nunchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration. Proportional increases of \nthe plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2-60 mg. Steady state is achieved after \n4-7 days of dosing. Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites. \nAbsorption is not influenced by food intake. Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%. \n \nDistribution \nThe estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 L/kg. \n \nPioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%). \n \nBiotransformation \nPioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. \nThis is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser \ndegree. Three of the six identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, and M-IV). When activity, \nconcentrations and protein binding are taken into account, pioglitazone and metabolite M-III \ncontribute equally to efficacy. On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold \nthat of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450. \nThere is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A, 2C8/9, and 3A4 in man. \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Concomitant \nadministration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with \nrifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the \nplasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nElimination \nFollowing oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in \nfaeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%). In animals, only a small amount of unchanged \npioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces. The mean plasma elimination half-life of \nunchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nSingle dose studies demonstrate linearity of pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. \n \nElderly \nSteady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower \nthan those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is \nsimilar. Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nTotal plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged, but with an increased volume of distribution. \nIntrinsic clearance is therefore reduced, coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone. \n \nMetformin \n \nAbsorption \nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg \nmetformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral dose, the non-absorbed \nfraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear. At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n1 µg/mL. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n4 µg/mL, even at maximum doses. \n \nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin. Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min \nprolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed. The clinical relevance of this \ndecrease is unknown. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean Vd ranged between 63-276 L. \n \nBiotransformation \nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans. \n \nElimination \nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 mL/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 h. When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to \nthat of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combined products of Glubrava. The following data \nare findings in studies performed with pioglitazone or metformin individually. \n \nPioglitazone \n \nIn toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric \ncardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. \nIn addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed. These findings were observed \nacross species at plasma concentrations ≤4 times the clinical exposure. Foetal growth restriction was \napparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in \ndiminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during \npregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.  \n \nPioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro \ngenotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) \nof the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.  \n \nThe formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was \npostulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A \n24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in \nan increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly \ndecreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated the \nhyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. The \nrelevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.  \n \nThere was no tumourigenic response in mice of either sex. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not \nseen in dogs or monkeys treated with pioglitazone for up to 12 months. \n \nIn an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other \nthiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is \nunknown. \n \nMetformin \n \nNon-clinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nGlubrava 15 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets \npioglitazone/metformin hydrochloride \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Glubrava is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Glubrava  \n3. How to take Glubrava  \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Glubrava \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Glubrava is and what it is used for \n \nGlubrava contains pioglitazone and metformin which are anti-diabetic medicines, used to control \nblood sugar level.  \n \nIt is used in adults to treat type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus when treatment with \nmetformin alone is not sufficient. This type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood particularly as a \nresult of the person being overweight and where the body either does not produce enough insulin (a \nhormone that controls blood sugar levels), or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.  \n \nGlubrava helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by helping your \nbody make better use of the insulin it produces. If 3 to 6 months after starting Glubrava your sugar \ncontrol is not improved, the medicine should be discontinued. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Glubrava  \n \nDo not take Glubrava: \n- if you are allergic to pioglitazone, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past. \n- if you recently had a heart attack, have severe circulatory problems including shock, or \n\nbreathing difficulties. \n- if you have liver disease. \n- if you drink alcohol excessively (either every day or only from time to time). \n- if you have uncontrolled diabetes with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see section “Risk of \nlactic acidosis”) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called 'ketone \nbodies' accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell. \n\n- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. \n- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n- if you have severely reduced kidney function. \n- if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated. \n- if you are going to have a certain type of X-ray with an injectable dye, talk to your doctor as you \n\nmust stop taking Glubrava for a certain period of time before and after the examination. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Glubrava (also see section 4) \n- if you have a problem with your heart. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes \n\nmellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin \ntogether experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if \nyou experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in \nweight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n\n- if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over \n75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and \nswelling, you must also tell your doctor. \n\n- if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back \nof the eye), talk to your doctor if you notice any change to your vision. \n\n- if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased \npossibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Glubrava. If \nthis applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned \npregnancy. \n\n- if you have a problem with your liver. Before you start taking Glubrava you will have a blood \nsample taken to check your liver function. This check should be repeated at intervals. Inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms suggesting a problem with your liver \n(like feeling sick without explanations, vomiting, stomach ache, tiredness, loss of appetite \nand/or dark urine) as your liver function should be checked.  \n\n \nYou may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia).  \nYour doctor may take blood tests to monitor your blood cell levels and liver function. \n \nRisk of lactic acidosis \nGlubrava may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your \nkidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).  \nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. \n \nStop taking Glubrava for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions. \n \nStop taking Glubrava and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience \nsome of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.  \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include: \n- vomiting \n- stomach ache (abdominal pain) \n- muscle cramps \n- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness \n- difficulty in breathing \n- reduced body temperature and heartbeat \n \nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. \n \nDuring treatment with Glubrava, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or \nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nIf you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Glubrava during and for some time after the \nprocedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nGlubrava. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nIf you take Glubrava with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood sugar could \nfall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). If you experience symptoms of hypoglycaemia such as \nweakness, dizziness, increased sweating, fast heart-beating, vision disorders or difficulty in \nconcentration, you should take some sugar to increase your blood sugar level again. Ask your doctor \nor pharmacist for more information if you are not sure how to recognise this. It is recommended that \nyou carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. \nThe level of sugar in your blood or urine should be checked regularly.  \n \nBroken bones \nA higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your \ndoctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Glubrava \nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Glubrava before or at the time of the \ninjection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nGlubrava. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may \nneed to adjust the dose of Glubrava. This is because some medicines can weaken or strenghten the \neffect of Glubrava on the level of sugar in your blood.  \n \nThe following medicines can increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Glubrava. This can lead to a \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar): \n- gemfibrozil (to lower high cholesterol level) \n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (to \n\ntreat high blood pressure) \n- cimetidine (to reduce stomach acid) \n \nThe following medicines may decrease the blood sugar lowering effect of Glubrava. This can lead to a \nrisk of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar level): \n- rifampicin (to treat tuberculosis and other infections) \n- glucocorticoids (to treat allergies and inflammation) \n- beta-2-agonists (to treat asthma) \n- medicines which increase urine production (diuretics, to treat high blood pressure) \n \nOther:  \nMedicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen and  \ncelecoxib). \n \nGlubrava with alcohol \nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Glubrava since this may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis (see section “Risk of lactic acidosis”). \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n- you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have \n\na baby. You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant. If you wish to become pregnant, \nyour doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine.  \n\n \n- do not use this medicine if you are breastfeeding or are planning to breast-feed (see section “Do \n\nnot take Glubrava”).  \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience \nabnormal vision. \n \n \n3. How to take Glubrava  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet taken twice daily. If necessary your doctor may tell you to take a \ndifferent dose. If you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose, which \nmay need to be given as separate tablets of pioglitazone and metformin.  \nYou should swallow the tablets with a glass of water. You may take your tablets with or just after food \nto reduce the chance of an upset stomach. \n \nIf you are following a special diet for diabetes, you should continue with this while you are taking \nGlubrava. \n \nYour weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. \n \nYour doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with Glubrava. This is to \ncheck that your liver is working normally. At least once a year (more often if you are elderly or have \nkidney problems) your doctor will check that your kidneys are working normally. \n \nIf you take more Glubrava than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a \ndoctor or pharmacist immediately. Your blood sugar could fall below the normal level and can be \nincreased by taking sugar. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or \nsugary fruit juice. \n \nIf you forget to take Glubrava \nTake Glubrava daily as prescribed. However if you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and just carry on \nwith the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking Glubrava \nGlubrava should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using Glubrava, your blood sugar \nmay go up. Talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn particular, patients have experienced the following serious side effects: \n \nGlubrava may cause a very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000), but very serious side effect called \nlactic acidosis (see section “Warnings and precautions”). If this happens you must stop taking \nGlubrava and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately, as lactic acidosis may lead to \ncoma. \n \nBladder cancer has been experienced uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) in patients \ntaking Glubrava. Signs and symptoms include blood in your urine, pain when urinating or a sudden \nneed to urinate. If you experience any of these, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nLocalised swelling (oedema) has also been experienced commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in \npatients taking Glubrava in combination with insulin. If you experience this side effect, talk to your \ndoctor as soon as possible. \n \nBroken bones have been reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in female patients \ntaking Glubrava and have also been reported in male patients (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data) taking Glubrava. If you experience this side effect, talk to your doctor as soon as \npossible. \n \nBlurred vision due to swelling (or fluid) at the back of the eye (macular oedema) has also been \nreported in patients taking Glubrava (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). If you \nexperience this symptom for the first time, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. Also, if you already \nhave blurred vision and the symptom gets worse, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nAllergic reactions have been reported with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data) in patients taking Glubrava. If you have a serious allergic reaction, including hives and \nswelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing stop \ntaking this medicine and talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nThe following side effects have been experienced by some patients taking Glubrava \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- stomach ache \n- feeling sick (nausea) \n- vomiting \n- diarrhoea \n- loss of appetite \n \nCommon \n- weight gain \n- headache \n- respiratory infection \n- abnormal vision \n- joint pain \n- impotence \n- blood in urine \n- reduction in blood count (anaemia) \n- numbness \n- taste disturbance \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nUncommon \n- inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) \n- gas \n- difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n \nVery rare \n- decrease in amount of vitamin B12 in the blood \n- redness of the skin \n- itchy skin \n- raised and itchy rash (hives) \n \nNot known \n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n- liver does not work as well as it should (changes in liver enzymes) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

The data presented during the current \nreporting period did not provide new information that would allow for further reduction, mitigation, or \ncharacterisation of these risks. Based on the data presented, the risk minimisation measures in the \napproved product information are considered adequate for the listed safety concerns. \nGiven the accumulation of data since the implementation of the additional risk minimisation measures, \nthe PRAC agreed with the MAH’s proposal to remove the additional risk minimisation measures. As a \nconsequence, the conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use of the medicinal \nproduct should be updated to remove the additional risk minimisation measures. The RMP has been \nupdated in accordance. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / \npioglitazone, pioglitazone the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal \nproduct(s) containing glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / pioglitazone, pioglitazone \nis unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
