NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nCystadane 1 g oral powder  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n1 g of powder contains 1 g of betaine anhydrous.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nOral powder. \n\nWhite crystalline free flowing powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAdjunctive treatment of homocystinuria, involving deficiencies or defects in: \n\n cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), \n\n 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), \n\n cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl). \n \n\nCystadane should be used as supplement to other therapies such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin \n\nB12 (cobalamin), folate and a specific diet. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nCystadane treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with \n\nhomocystinuria. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nChildren and Adult \n\nThe recommended total daily dose is 100 mg/kg/day given in 2 doses daily. However, the dose should \n\nbe individually titrated according to plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine. In some patients \n\ndoses above 200 mg/ kg/day were needed to reach therapeutic goals. Caution should be exercised with \n\nup-titrating doses for patients with CBS deficiency due to the risk for hypermethioninaemia. \n\nMethionine levels should be closely monitored in these patients.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nExperience with betaine anhydrous therapy in patients with renal insufficiency or non-alcoholic \n\nhepatic steatosis has demonstrated no need to adapt the dose regimen of Cystadane.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe bottle should be lightly shaken before opening. Three measuring spoons are provided which \n\ndispense either 100 mg, 150 mg or 1 g of betaine anhydrous. It is recommended that a heaped \n\nmeasuring spoon is removed from the bottle and a flat surface e.g. base of a knife is drawn across the \n\ntop of the measure. This will give the following doses: small measure 100 mg, middle size \n\nmeasure  150 mg and large measure 1 g of betaine anhydrous. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe powder should be mixed with water, juice, milk, formula or food until completely dissolved and \n\ningested immediately after mixing. \n \n\nTherapeutic monitoring  \n\nThe aim of treatment is to keep plasma levels of total homocysteine below 15 µM or as low as \n\npossible. The steady-state response usually occurs within a month. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nUncommon cases of severe cerebral oedema associated with hypermethioninemia were reported with \n\nbetaine anhydrous therapy in patients with CBS deficiency (see section 4.8). Complete recovery was \n\nseen after treatment discontinuation: \n\n- The plasma methionine concentrations should be kept below 1000 µM. It is recommended to \nmeasure plasma methionine level at start of treatment and about annually or biannually \n\nthereafter. If methionine increases particularly above the first safety threshold of 700 µmol/L, \n\npatient should be monitored more frequently and compliance with diet should be checked. In \n\norder to reduce methionine levels, modification of diet as well as dose reduction of Cystadane or \n\ntemporal interruption of Cystadane treatment should be considered. \n\n- If any symptoms of cerebral oedema like morning headaches with vomiting and/or visual changes \nappear, plasma methionine level and compliance to the diet should be checked and treatment with \n\nCystadane interrupted.  \n\n- If symptoms of cerebral oedema recur after re-introduction of treatment then betaine anhydrous \ntherapy should be discontinued indefinitely. \n\n \n\nTo minimise the risk of potential drug interactions, it is advisable to leave 30 minutes between the \n\nintake of betaine anhydrous and amino acids mixtures and/or medicinal products containing vigabatrin \n\nand GABA analogues (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.  \n\nBased on in vitro data, betaine anhydrous might interact with amino acids mixtures and medicinal \n\nproducts containing vigabatrin and GABA analogues. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse event of betaine anhydrous on \n\npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. To date, no other relevant epidemiologic data \n\nare available. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. During pregnancy, administering \n\nbetaine anhydrous in addition to pyridoxine, folate, anticoagulant and diet under close monitoring of \n\nplasma homocysteine would be compatible with good maternal and foetal outcomes. However, \n\nCystadane should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n  \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether betaine anhydrous is excreted in human milk (although its metabolic \n\nprecursor, choline, occurs at high levels in human milk).  Because of lack of data, caution should be \n\nexercised when prescribing Cystadane to breast-feeding women.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo data is available. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nCystadane has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nIn general, adverse reactions seen with betaine anhydrous therapy appeared to be not serious and are \n\nmainly related to the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal disorders like diarrhoea, glossitis, nausea, \n\nstomach discomfort, vomiting and dental disorders may occur uncommonly. \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction during treatment is blood methionine increased. \n\nComplete recovery was seen after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10),  uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Uncommon: anorexia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: agitation, irritability \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon: brain oedema* \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nUncommon: diarrhoea, glossitis, nausea, stomach \n\ndiscomfort, vomiting  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon: hair loss, hives, skin odour abnormal \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon: urinary incontinence \n\nInvestigations Very common: blood methionine increased* \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n*Uncommon cases of severe cerebral oedema and hypermethioninemia were reported within 2 weeks \n\nto 6 months of starting betaine anhydrous therapy in patients with CBS deficiency, with complete \n\nrecovery after treatment discontinuation.  \n\nSymptoms of cerebral oedema include morning headaches with vomiting and/or visual changes  \n\nHigh increases in plasma methionine levels in a range from 1,000 to 3,000 µM were noted in these \n\npatients. As cerebral oedema has also been reported in patients with hypermethioninemia, secondary \n\nhypermethioninemia due to betaine anhydrous therapy has been postulated as a possible mechanism of \n\naction. \n\nFor specific recommendations, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AA06. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nBetaine anhydrous was shown to lower plasma homocysteine levels in the three types of \n\nhomocystinuria, i.e. CBS deficiency; MTHFR deficiency and cbl defect. The extent of this effect was \n\ndependent on the absolute degree of hyperhomocysteinemia, being higher in severe \n\nhyperhomocysteinemia. \n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nBetaine anhydrous acts as a methyl group donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine \n\nin patients with homocystinuria. As a result, plasma levels of homocysteine should decrease in these \n\npatients, to 20-30 % of pre-treatment levels. \n\nBetaine anhydrous has also been shown to increase plasma methionine and S-adenosyl methionine \n\n(SAM) levels in patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defects. In CBS-deficient patients without \n\ndietary restriction of methionine, excessive accumulation of methionine has been observed. \n\nBetaine anhydrous supplementation was shown to improve the metabolic abnormalities in the \n\ncerebrospinal fluid of patients with homocystinuria. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nElevated homocysteine plasma levels are associated with cardiovascular events (such as thrombosis), \n\nosteoporosis, skeletal abnormalities, and optic lens dislocation. In observational studies, clinical \n\nimprovement (cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental) was reported by the treating physician in about \n\n75% of patients taking betaine anhydrous. Most of these patients were also receiving other treatments \n\nsuch as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folate with variable biochemical \n\nresponses. In most cases, adding betaine anhydrous resulted in a further reduction in plasma \n\nhomocysteine level. It is likely that due to the multiple nature of therapy (dietary, pharmaceutical, \n\nsupportive) in these patients, there may be an element of overestimation in the clinical effects of \n\nbetaine anhydrous treatment. Late detection of homocystinuria in symptomatic state is responsible for \n\nresidual morbidity due to irreversible damage to connective tissue (ophtalmological, skeletal) that \n\ncannot be corrected by further therapy. The available clinical data do not allow correlating posology \n\nand clinical efficacy. There is no evidence of development of tolerance. \n\n \n\nIn a few cases, increased plasma methionine levels were associated with cerebral oedema (see sections \n\n4.4 and 4.8). \n \n\nMonitoring plasma homocysteine levels has demonstrated that the onset of action of betaine \n\nanhydrous occurred within several days and that a steady-state response was achieved within one \n\nmonth.   \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn paediatric patients less than 10 years of age, the usual effective dose regimen is  100 mg/kg/day \n\ngiven in 2 doses daily; increasing the frequency above twice daily and/or the dose \n\nabove  150 mg/kg/day does not improve the homocysteine-lowering effect.   \n\n \n\nMonitoring betaine plasma concentrations does not help to define the efficacy of treatment, since these \n\nconcentrations do not directly correspond to the flux through the cytosolic betaine homocysteine \n\nmethyl transferase pathway. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic data of homocystinuric patients on long-term betaine anhydrous supplementation \n\nare very similar to those of healthy volunteers. This demonstrates that differences in betaine anhydrous \n\nkinetics are most probably due to betaine anhydrous depletion in untreated homocystinuria and are \n\nonly meaningful for the initial treatment. \n\n \nAbsorption \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of betaine anhydrous has not been determined. In healthy adult volunteers \n(age between 21 to 49 years), after a single oral dose of betaine anhydrous (50 mg/kg), absorption \n\nwas rapid (tmax = 0.9 ± 0.3 hours and a Cmax = 0.9 ± 0.2 mM).  \nAfter a repeated dose regimen of 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days, the absorption kinetics did not change. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nBetaine anhydrous was rapidly distributed into a relatively large volume (V/F = 1.3 l/kg). \nAfter a repeated dose regiment of 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days, the distribution half life was prolonged \n\nsignificantly (up to 36 h), indicating saturable transport and redistribution processes. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nBetaine anhydrous is a methyl group donor \n \n\nElimination \n\nWith a slow elimination rate (mean half life = 14 h, mean total body clearance, CL/F, = 84 ml/h/kg), \nrenal clearance is negligible (5% of total body clearance), assuming 100% bioavailability.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAt high doses, a CNS depressant effect and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract was seen in rats. \n\nLong-term carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted on betaine \n\nanhydrous. A standard battery of genotoxicity test reveals no specific hazard for humans. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nCystadane 1 g oral powder \n\nBetaine anhydrous \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Cystadane is and what it is used for \n\n2. What do you need to know before you take Cystadane \n\n3. How to take Cystadane \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5 How to store Cystadane \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Cystadane is and what it is used for \n \n\nCystadane contains betaine anhydrous which is intended to be an adjunctive treatment of \n\nhomocystinuria, an inherited (genetic) disease where the amino acid methionine cannot be broken \n\ndown completely by the body. \n\n \n\nMethionine is present in regular food protein (e.g. meat, fish, milk, cheese, eggs). It is converted into \n\nhomocysteine which is then normally converted into cysteine during digestion. Homocystinuria is a \n\ndisease caused by the accumulation of homocysteine which is not converted to cysteine and is \n\ncharacterised by formation of clots in the veins, bone weakness, and skeletal and crystalline lens \n\nabnormalities. The use of Cystadane together with other treatments such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, \n\nfolate and a specific diet aims to reduce the elevated homocysteine levels in your body.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Cystadane \n \n\nDo not take Cystadane \nIf you are allergic to betaine anhydrous. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cystadane. \n\nIf you notice side effects like headaches, vomiting or a change in your vision and you are of the \n\nhomocystinuria subtype called CBS (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency), please contact your \n\ndoctor immediately, they could be signs of a swelling in the brain (cerebral oedema). In that case your \n\ndoctor will monitor your methionine level in your body and may review your diet. Your treatment \n\nwith Cystadane may need to be interrupted. \n\nIf you are treated with Cystadane and with an amino-acid mixture and if you need to take other \n\nmedicines at the same time, leave 30 minutes between the intake (see “section “Other medicines and \n\nCystadane”). \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Cystadane \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\nIf you are taking amino-acid mixture or medicines such as vigabatrin or Gaba analogues (medicine \n\nused to treat epilepsy), please tell your doctor as they might interact with your treatment with \n\nCystadane. \n\n  \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will decide if you can use this \n\nmedicine during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nCystadane has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Cystadane \n \n\nThe use of this medicine will be supervised by a doctor experienced in the treatment of patients with \n\nhomocystinuria. \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose in children and adults is 100mg/kg/day divided in 2 dosesper day. In some \n\npatients doses above 200 mg/ kg/day were needed to reach therapeutic goals. Your doctor may adapt \n\nthe dose depending on your laboratory values.  \n\n \n\nYou will therefore need regular blood tests to determine the correct daily dose. \n\n \n\nYou should take Cystadane orally (by mouth). \n\nTo measure the dose:  \n\n shake the bottle lightly before opening \n\n take the correct measuring spoon:  \n\n the small green spoon measures  100 mg of betaine anhydrous powder;  \n\n the middle size blue spoon measures  150 mg of betaine anhydrous powder ; \n\n the large pink spoon measures 1 g of betaine anhydrous powder. \n\n take a heaped spoonful of powder out of the bottle \n\n pass the flat back of a knife over the top of the spoon \n\n the powder left in the spoon is one spoonful \n\n take the correct number of spoonfuls of powder from the bottle \n \n\nMix the measured dose of powder with water, juice, milk, formula or food until completely dissolved \n\nand ingest immediately after mixing. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Cystadane than you should \n\nIf you accidentally take too much Cystadane, talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Cystadane \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten doses. If you forget to take a dose take it as soon as \n\nyou remember it and continue the next dose as planned. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Cystadane \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nDo not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor. Contact your doctor or pharmacist before \n\nstopping. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly side effect when taking Cystadane which may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\n(frequency very common) is elevated levels of methionine in the blood.  \n\nMethionine level can be related to swelling in the brain (cerebral swelling), which may affect up to 1 \n\nin 100 people (frequency uncommon). If you experience morning headaches with vomiting and/or \n\nvisual changes, contact immediately your doctor (they could be signs of a swelling in the brain). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders like diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomach discomfort and inflammation of \n\nthe tongue may occur uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).  \n\nOther uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) may include decreased appetite \n\n(anorexia), agitation, irritability, hair loss, hives, skin odour abnormal, lack of control over passing \n\nurine (urinary incontinence). \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.
