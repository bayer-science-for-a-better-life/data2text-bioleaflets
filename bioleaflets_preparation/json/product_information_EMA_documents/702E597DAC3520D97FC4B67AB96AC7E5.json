This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEVARREST Sealant Matrix \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nComponent 1: \n Human Fibrinogen  8.1 mg/cm2 \n \nComponent 2 \n Human Thrombin  40 IU/cm2 \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nContains up to 3.0 mmol (68.8 mg) sodium per sealant matrix.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSealant Matrix \n \nEVARREST is a white-to-yellow bio-absorbable combination product made from a flexible composite \nMatrix, coated with Human Fibrinogen and Human Thrombin. The active side of the sealant matrix is \npowdery, and the non-active side has an embossed wave pattern. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSupportive treatment in adult surgery where standard surgical techniques are insufficient (see section \n5.1): \n\n- for improvement of haemostasis.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of EVARREST is restricted to experienced surgeons. \n \nPosology \nThe amount of EVARREST to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented \ntowards the underlying clinical needs of the patient. \n \nThe dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgical \nintervention, the size of the area and the mode of intended application, and the number of applications. \n \nThe quantity of EVARREST to be applied depends upon the area and location of the bleeding area to \nbe treated. EVARREST should be applied so it extends approximately 1 to 2 cm beyond the margins \nof the target bleeding area.  It can be cut to the size and shape required to fit the size of the bleeding \narea. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nBleeding areas larger than those which can be covered by a single unit of EVARREST have not been \ninvestigated in clinical studies. EVARREST should only be used in a single layer, with an overlap of \napproximately 1 to 2 cm onto non-bleeding tissue or an adjacent EVARREST sealant matrix. \n \nMultiple bleeding sites may be treated simultaneously. In total, no more than the equivalent of two \n10.2 cm x 10.2 cm units or four 5.1 cm x 10.2 cm units should remain in the body as there is only \nlimited long-term experience with larger quantities. The use of more than four 10.2 cm x 10.2 cm units \nor eight 5.1 cm x 10.2 cm units, or the use in patients that have been previously exposed to \nEVARREST, has not been studied. \n \nIf haemostasis is not reached with one application of EVARREST, re-treatment may be administered.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of EVARREST in children from birth to 18 years has not yet been established. \nNo data are available.   \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor epilesional use only.  \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  The \nproduct should only be administered according to the instructions recommended for this product (see \nsection 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n● EVARREST must not be applied intravascularly. \n \n● Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n● EVARREST must not be used to treat severe bleeding from large defects in large arteries or \n\nveins where the injured vascular wall requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and \nwhich would result in persistent exposure of EVARREST to blood flow and/or pressure during \nhealing and absorption of the product. \n\n  \n● EVARREST must not be used in closed spaces (e.g., in, around, or in proximity to foramina in \n\nbone or areas of bony confine) since swelling may cause nerve or blood vessel compression. \n \n● EVARREST must not be used in the presence of active infection or in contaminated areas of the \n\nbody because infection may occur. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly \n \nLife-threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied \nintravascularly. \n \nAs with any protein containing product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of \nhypersensitivity reactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, \nhypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the product should be removed immediately \nand other hemostatic agent or methods should be used.   \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nEVARREST should not be used in place of sutures or other forms of mechanical ligation for the \ntreatment of major arterial bleeding.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nApplications for which adequate data are not available \nAdequate data are not available to support the use of this product in neurosurgery or application \nthrough a flexible endoscope for treatment of bleeding, in vascular surgery, or in gastrointestinal \nanastomoses. \n \nAs with any implantable product, foreign body reactions may occur. \n \nEVARREST should only be used in a single layer, with an overlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm onto \nnon-bleeding tissue, to assist with adherence to the wound site. The size of EVARREST should be \nlimited to what is necessary for haemostasis.  \n \nEVARREST contains up to 3.0 mmol (68.8 mg) sodium per sealant matrix. To be taken into \nconsideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection, and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infectious agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped virus \nhepatitis A virus (HAV). The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses \nsuch as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal \ninfection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or abnormal erythropoiesis (e.g., haemolytic \nanaemia). \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time EVARREST is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nSimilar to comparable products or thrombin solutions, the product may be denatured after exposure to \nsolutions containing alcohol, iodine, or heavy metals (e.g., antiseptic solutions). Such substances \nshould be removed to the greatest possible extent before applying the product. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of fibrin sealants/haemostatics for use in human pregnancy or during breast-feeding has not \nbeen established in controlled clinical trials. Experimental animal studies are insufficient to assess the \nsafety with respect to reproduction, development of the embryo or foetus, the course of gestation, and \nperi- and post-natal development.  \n \nTherefore, the product should be administered to pregnant and lactating women only if clearly needed.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \napplication site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, \nlethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may \noccur in rare cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants/haemostatic products. In isolated cases, these \nreactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen if the \npreparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to \nconstituents of the product.  \n \nAntibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely. \n \nThromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied intravascularly \n(see section 4.4). \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nAdverse Reactions \nThe safety data for EVARREST reflect the types of post-operative complication generally related to \nthe surgical settings in which the trials were conducted and the underlying disease of the patients. In \nclinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were haemorrhage and increased \nfibrinogen, and the most serious adverse reactions were aspiration, pulmonary embolism, and \nhaemorrhage. \n \nEVARREST was used to treat soft tissue bleeding during retroperitoneal, intra-abdominal, pelvic, or \nthoracic surgery, suture hole bleeding during cardiovascular surgery, and parenchymal bleeding during \nhepatic or renal surgery across all clinical trials involving 381 subjects treated with EVARREST and \n272 control subjects.  Of the enrolled subjects, 4.7% of EVARREST treated subjects (18 subjects out \nof 381) and 2.6% of control subjects (7 subjects out of 272) experienced one or more adverse \nreactions. \n \nA post-marketing safety study enrolling 150 subjects was conducted using EVARREST.  It was a \nprospective, randomised, controlled single-centre study observing the clinical utility of EVARREST \nagainst Standard of Care (SoC) in soft tissue bleeding during intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic \nand non-cardiac thoracic surgery.  Standard of Care was manual compression (MC) with or without a \ntopical absorbable haemostat (TAH) or any other adjunctive haemostasis technique that was deemed \nby the surgeon to be his/her standard of care. \n \nStudy subjects were followed post-operatively through discharge and at Day 30 (+/-14 days) post \ndischarge.  The incidence of thromboembolic events, the incidence of post-operative bleeding events \nspecifically related to the target bleeding site and the incidence of increased blood fibrinogen levels \nwere assessed and recorded up to the 30 days follow-up period. \n \nOne (1/75) adverse reaction of deep vein thrombosis was reported in the EVARREST group.   \n \nImmunogenicity was evaluated in soft tissue clinical studies by testing blood samples collected at \nbaseline, 4 to 6 weeks, and 8 to 10 weeks post-surgery for antibodies to human thrombin and \nfibrinogen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.  Three subjects out of 145 (~2%) in the group \ntreated with EVARREST showed an increase in the titre of anti-thrombin antibodies after treatment. \nTwo subjects out of 145 (~1%) in the group treated with EVARREST showed a transient increase in \nfibrinogen antibody titres, with titre levels back at background levels at the 8 to 10 week time point.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nData from eight clinical trials with EVARREST have been pooled into an integrated dataset and the \nfrequencies of occurrence described in the table below originate from this integrated dataset. In the \nintegrated analyses, 381 patients were treated with EVARREST and 272 patients were treated with \ncontrol treatment.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nAll adverse reactions reported during the clinical trials occurred at a frequency of less than 1% \n(uncommon).  Most adverse reactions were reported as single events: intra-abdominal haemorrhage, \nabdominal distension, anaemia, thoracic cavity drainage, pleural effusion, abdominal abscess, ascites, \ndeep vein thrombosis, localized intra-abdominal fluid collection, operative haemorrhage, ischaemic \nbowel and pulmonary embolism, except blood fibrinogen increased (3 events, 0.8%), anastomotic \nhaemorrhage (3 events, 0.8%), and post procedural haemorrhage (2 events, 0.5%)   \n \nThe following categories are used to rank the adverse reactions by frequency of occurrence: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); and very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nTable 1 Summary of Adverse Reactions to EVARREST \nMedDRA System Organ Class Preferred Term  Frequency \nVascular disorders Deep vein thrombosis Uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nAspiration  \nPleural effusion  \nPulmonary embolism  \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal distension  \nAscites  \nHaemorrhage  \n● Gastrointestinal haemorrhage  \n● Intra-abdominal haemorrhage  \nLocalised intra-abdominal fluid collection  \nPeripancreatic fluid collection  \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n \n \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nInvestigations Blood fibrinogen increased   Uncommon \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\nPost-procedural haemorrhage  \nOperative Haemorrhage \nAnastomotic Haemorrhage \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPulmonary embolism  \nBlood clots, including those clots that may travel in blood vessels to other parts of the body, \nparticularly the lungs (pulmonary embolus) may occur after any major surgery. In clinical trials of \nEVARREST no difference has been observed between EVARREST and control groups with regard to \nthe incidence of thrombotic events, currently suggesting no increased risk with EVARREST use. Due \nto the nature of surgical procedures and the physiological response to surgical trauma all surgical \nsubjects are at risk for occurrence of thromboembolism.   \n \nDeep vein thrombosis \nThe overall incidence of deep vein thrombosis observed during clinical trials was consistent with \npublished data and does not suggest an increased risk for thrombotic events in EVARREST-treated \nsubjects, although from the available data, this risk cannot be completely ruled out. \n \nAnti-thrombin antibodies \nThree subjects out of 145 (~2%) in a clinical trial group treated with EVARREST showed an increase \nin the titre of anti-thrombin antibodies after treatment. None of the patients in any treatment group had \na significant change in antibody titre to thrombin or fibrinogen.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

In contact with physiological fluids, e.g., blood, lymph, or physiological \nsaline, the components of the coating are activated, and the reaction of fibrinogen and thrombin \ninitiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin \nmonomers which spontaneously polymerise to form a fibrin clot that holds the Matrix firmly to the \nwound surface. The fibrin is then cross-linked by endogenous Factor XIII, creating a firm, \nmechanically stable fibrin network with good adhesive properties. \n \nThe composite Matrix is composed of polyglactin 910 and oxidized regenerated cellulose, a \ncommonly used haemostat. The Matrix provides physical support and a large surface area for the \nbiological components, imparts inherent mechanical integrity to the product and supports clot \nformation. The clot formation of EVARREST is integrated with the Matrix; it forms a mechanical \nbarrier to bleeding and reinforces the wound site. Natural healing occurs while the fibrin degrades and \nthe product is absorbed by the body; absorption is considered to take approximately 8 weeks, as \ndemonstrated in rodent and swine animal models. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical studies demonstrating haemostasis in mild or moderate soft tissue bleeding were conducted in \na total of 141 subjects (111 treated with EVARREST and 30 with control) undergoing abdominal, \nretroperitoneal, pelvic, and (non-cardiac) thoracic surgery. A further trial in 91 patients undergoing \nabdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and (non-cardiac) thoracic surgery (59 treated with EVARREST \nand 32 with control) demonstrated haemostasis in severe soft tissue bleeding.  Two clinical studies in \n206 patients undergoing hepatic surgery (110 treated with EVARREST and 96 with control) \ndemonstrated haemostatic efficacy in persistent parenchymal bleeding. \n \nA prospective randomised controlled clinical study was conducted enrolling 156 subjects (76 \nEVARREST, 80 haemostatic fleece) demonstrating the safety and haemostatic effectiveness of \nEVARREST as an adjunct to controlling bleeding during cardiovascular surgery. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nEVARREST in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of haemorrhage \nresulting from a surgical procedure (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEVARREST is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. As a \nconsequence, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man. \n \nStudies have been conducted in rabbits to evaluate the absorption and elimination of thrombin when \napplied to the cut surface of the liver resulting from partial hepatectomy. Using 125I-thrombin it was \nshown that a slow absorption of biologically inactive peptides resulting from the breakdown of \nthrombin occurred, reaching a Cmax in the plasma after 6-8 hours. At the Cmax, the plasma \nconcentration represented only 1 to 2% of the applied dose.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nFibrin sealants/haemostatics are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin, by fibrinolysis and \nphagocytosis.  \n \nAfter the biologic components have been absorbed, the Matrix components (polyglactin 910 and \noxidized regenerated cellulose) absorb completely. In animal studies EVARREST was absorbed by \n56 days when used at the anticipated clinical dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe haemostatic efficacy of EVARREST was demonstrated in a number of animal models assessing \ntime to haemostasis and post-treatment blood loss, among other endpoints. \n \nNon-clinical data on the Matrix component reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of \ncytotoxicity, sensitization, intracutaneous reactivity, acute systemic toxicity, material-mediated \npyrogenicity, subchronic toxicity, genotoxicity, implantation, and hemocompatibility.  \n \nA 90-day study in rats to evaluate subchronic systemic toxicity and immunogenicity of EVARREST \nafter subcutaneous implantation found no signs of toxic effects and no evidence of increased \nimmunogenicity relative to fibrin sealant products.  \n \n \n6.

The tray is in a sachet (polyester laminated \naluminum foil) with a seal.  Pack size of 2, 5.1 cm x 10.2 cm sealant matrices. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe instructions for use are also described in the in the healthcare professional’s package leaflet part. \n \n● EVARREST comes ready to use in sterile packages and must be handled using sterile technique \n\nin aseptic conditions. Discard damaged packages. \n \n● To open the product, remove the foil sachet from the carton, carefully peel open the foil sachet \n\navoiding contact with the inside of the foil or the white sterile tray containing EVARREST. \n \n● Remove the white sterile tray from the pouch and place onto the sterile field. \n \n● Hold the tray securely in the palm of the hand, ensuring that the side with the holes is facing \n\nupwards, and use the tabs on the side of the tray to remove the top of the tray with the other \nhand. \n\n \n● The lower portion of the tray contains EVARREST with the active side facing downwards. The \n\nactive side is powdery in appearance.  The non-active side has an embossed wave pattern. \n \n● Keep EVARREST dry after opening. The product can remain in the sterile field to be available \n\nfor use throughout the procedure. EVARREST does not stick to gloves, forceps, or surgical \ninstruments. \n\n \nApplication of EVARREST \n \nEVARREST is to be applied with approximately 3 minutes of firm manual compression. \n \n1. Using sterile scissors, carefully cut EVARREST to the size and shape as necessary to fit and \n\nmaintain contact with the bleeding area with an overlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm. Keep the \npowdery white-to-yellow colour active side of EVARREST facing down while in the tray. \n\n \n\n \n \n2. Remove excess blood or fluid from the site of application if required to improve visibility. The \n\nbleeding source should be clearly identified, and it must be ensured that EVARREST is applied \ndirectly onto the bleeding source by covering it completely. EVARREST can be used in an \nactively bleeding field.  \n\n \n3. Apply the active side of EVARREST to the bleeding area, allowing full contact with the tissue. \n\nThe product is activated upon contact with fluid, and adheres and conforms to tissue. \n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n4. Apply an appropriately sized piece of EVARREST to adequately cover the entire bleeding area, \nwith an overlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm onto non-bleeding tissue, to assist with adherence to \nthe wound site. \n\n \n\n \n \n5a) Hold dry or moist surgical gauze or laparotomy pads over EVARREST to achieve full contact \n\nwith the bleeding surface.  \n \n\n  \n \n5b) To ensure haemostasis, immediately apply manual compression over the entire surface of \n\nEVARREST (including the area of overlap) sufficient to stem all bleeding. Maintain \ncompression for approximately 3 minutes, to control the bleeding.   \n\n \n\n \n \n6. Gently remove surgical gauze or laparotomy pads from the application site, without disrupting \n\nor dislodging EVARREST or the clot. Inspect EVARREST to verify that haemostasis has been \nachieved and to ensure that there is no crimping over the bleeding area. If not satisfied with the \nplacement, remove EVARREST and use a new EVARREST sealant matrix. EVARREST will \nremain in place and adhere to the tissue, and is absorbable. \n\n \n\n \n \n7. The application site should be monitored intraoperatively to verify that haemostasis is \n\nmaintained. \n \nRe-Treatment \n \n● Re-treatment may be required if there are folds, creases, or crimps in the EVARREST sealant \n\nmatrix. If not satisfied with the placement of EVARREST, remove the used EVARREST \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nsealant matrix and repeat the application procedure above with a new EVARREST sealant \nmatrix. \n\n \n● If bleeding is due to insufficient coverage of the bleeding area, additional EVARREST sealant \n\nmatrices may be applied. Apply in a single layer; ensure that the edges overlap (by \napproximately 1 to 2 cm) with the existing EVARREST sealant matrix. \n\n \n● If bleeding is due to incomplete adherence to the tissue (where bleeding persists from under the \n\ndressing), remove EVARREST sealant matrix and use a new EVARREST sealant matrix. \n \n\n● If bleeding still occurs during or after the specified duration of compression, remove the used \nEVARREST sealant matrix and inspect the bleeding site. If no other primary haemostatic \nmeasures (i.e., standard surgical techniques) appear to be required, repeat the application \nprocedure above with a new EVARREST sealant matrix. \n\n \nDisposal \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements \n \n \n7.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What EVARREST is and what it is used for \n \nEVARREST is a combination product made from an absorbable material (Matrix) coated with human \nfibrinogen and human thrombin.  \n \nFibrinogen is a protein extracted from the blood that forms a fibrin clot when acted upon by the \nenzyme thrombin. When the dry powder coating of EVARREST is wetted, the thrombin acts on the \nfibrinogen to rapidly form a clot. The fibrin clot becomes embedded in the Matrix which enables \nEVARREST to stick firmly to the surrounding tissue. \n \nEVARREST is applied during surgical operations in adult subjects, to stop bleeding and oozing during \nthe operation. It is applied directly onto tissue where it sticks firmly and stops bleeding. It is left in \nplace after the operation and is absorbed by the body. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are treated with EVARREST: \n \nYour surgeon must not treat you with EVARREST in the following circumstances: \n \nEVARREST must not be applied inside blood vessels. \n \nYou must not be treated with EVARREST if you are allergic to human fibrinogen or human thrombin \nor to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nEVARREST must not be used to repair injuries to the wall of large arteries or veins where the product \nis exposed to constant blood flow and pressure. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nEVARREST must not be used in closed spaces (for example, in, around, or next to openings or \npassages in the bone or other restricted areas around bone) where it could swell and compress nerves \nor blood vessels. \n \nEVARREST must not be used in the presence of active infection or in contaminated areas of the body \nbecause infection may occur. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your surgeon before you are treated with EVARREST. \n \nApplications for which adequate data are not available \nThe use of EVARREST has not been studied in the following procedures, and there is therefore no \ninformation to show that it would be effective: \n \n- surgery to the brain or spinal cord \n- controlling bleeding in the stomach or intestines by applying the product through an endoscope \n\n(tube) \n- sealing surgical repairs to the intestines. \n \nForeign body reactions \nAs with any product which is implanted, the body may develop a reaction to the foreign material. This \ncould result in problems with healing. EVARREST should only be used in a single layer with an \noverlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm onto non-bleeding tissue to help it stick to the bleeding area. The \nsize of EVARREST should be limited to what is necessary to stop bleeding. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nAllergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of such reactions include hives, rash, \ntightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure, and anaphylaxis (a severe reaction with a \nrapid onset). If these symptoms occur during surgery, the use of the product should be stopped \nimmediately. \n \nTransmission of infectious agents \nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include: \n \n- careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded. \n- the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections.  \n- the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove \n\nviruses.  \n \nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are given, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or \nemerging viruses, or other types of infections. \n \nThe measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for \nenveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C \nvirus, and for the non-enveloped virus, hepatitis A. The measures taken may be of limited value \nagainst non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for \npregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have \nsome types of anaemia (e.g., sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you are treated with EVARREST, the name and batch \nnumber of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nEVARREST is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and EVARREST \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nThere is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the \nuse of EVARREST during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding, or whether it could affect fertility. If \nyou are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nEVARREST contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains up to 3.0 mmol (68.8 mg) sodium in each EVARREST sealant matrix. This \nshould be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.  \n \n \n3. How EVARREST is used \n \nThe surgeon will apply EVARREST during your operation. It is applied by pressing firmly onto \nbleeding tissue for approximately 3 minutes. EVARREST is activated upon contact with blood or \nother fluid and will stick firmly to the tissue. It is left in place and is absorbed by the body in \napproximately 8 weeks. \n \nEVARREST can be cut to the size and shape required to fit the size of the bleeding area. The amount \nof EVARREST that will be applied depends on the surface area and location of the bleeding site to be \ntreated during the operation. EVARREST should only be used in a single layer. Up to the equivalent \nof two 10.2 cm x 10.2 cm units or four 5.1 cm x 10.2 cm units should be used if needed to cover the \nentire bleeding area, with an overlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm. If bleeding still occurs, the \nEVARREST sealant matrix can be removed, and a new one can be applied. \n \nThe total amount of EVARREST left in the body after the operation should not exceed the size of two \n10.2 cm x 10.2 cm sealant matrices or four 5.1 cm x 10.2 cm sealant matrices. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing adverse events which occurred during clinical studies were considered to be related to the \nuse of EVARREST: \n \nMost Serious Side Effects \nBleeding (haemorrhage) \n \n- From the connection of two vessels (anastomotic haemorrhage); the frequency was \n\nuncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n- From the stomach (intra-abdominal haemorrhage); the frequency was uncommon (may affect \n\nup to 1 in 100 people). \n- During surgery (operative haemorrhage); the frequency was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in \n\n100 people). \n- After surgery (post-procedural haemorrhage); the frequency was uncommon (may affect up to \n\n1 in 100 people). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nBlood clot (thromboembolism) \n \n- In the veins, particularly of the legs (deep vein thrombosis) \n- In the arteries supplying the lungs (pulmonary embolism) \n The frequency of both of these effects was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n \nUnintentional fluid intake into the airway (aspiration), build up of excess fluid in the cavity \nsurrounding the lungs; the frequency was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n \nAccumulation of fluid in the stomach, swelling of the stomach; the frequency was uncommon (may \naffect up to 1 in 100 people). \n \nAccumulation of fluid in the pancreas: the frequency was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 \npeople). \n \nIncrease in the levels of fibrinogen in the blood: the frequency was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in \n100 people). \n \nIf you experience any symptoms such as vomiting with blood, blood in your stool, blood in your \ndraining tube from your abdomen, swelling or skin discolouration in your extremities, chest pain and \nshortness of breath, and/or any other symptoms related to your surgery, please contact your doctor or \nsurgeon immediately. \n \nEVARREST contains the components of fibrin sealant. Fibrin sealants may, in rare cases (up to 1 in \n1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. If you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or \nmore of the following symptoms: swelling under the skin (angioedema), skin rash, hives or wheals \n(nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, increased heart rate, tingling, vomiting, or wheezing. If you experience any of these \nsymptoms after surgery you should consult your doctor or surgeon. \n \nThere is a also a theoretical possibility that you could develop antibodies to the proteins in \nEVARREST, which could potentially interfere with blood clotting. The frequency of this type of event \nis not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or surgeon. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5. How EVARREST is stored \n \nEVARREST must be kept out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nEVARREST must not be used after the expiry date which is stated on the foil sachet as well as the \ncarton after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nEVARREST must not be stored above 25°C and must not be frozen. \n \nEVARREST must be kept dry at all times prior to application to avoid pre-activation.  \n \nThe foil sachet protects EVARREST from moisture and from microbiological contamination.  \n \n \n6.

Discard damaged packages as re-sterilisation is not possible. \n \nTo open the product, remove the foil sachet from the carton, carefully peel open the foil sachet \navoiding contact with the inside of the foil or the white sterile tray containing EVARREST. \n \nRemove the white sterile tray from the pouch and place onto the sterile field. \n \nHold the tray securely in the palm of the hand, ensuring that the side with the holes is facing upwards, \nand use the tabs on the side of the tray to remove the top of the tray with the other hand. \n \nThe lower portion of the tray contains EVARREST with the active side facing downwards. The active \nside is powdery in appearance. The non-active side has an embossed wave pattern. \n \nKeep EVARREST dry after opening. The EVARREST sealant matrix can remain in the sterile field to \nbe available for use throughout the procedure. EVARREST does not stick to gloves, forceps, or \nsurgical instruments. \n \nStorage of EVARREST \n \nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the carton and label.  \n \nKeep out of sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not store above 25°C.  Do not freeze. \n \n \nApplication of EVARREST \n \nFor epilesional use only. EVARREST is to be applied with approximately 3 minutes of firm manual \ncompression. \n \n1. Using sterile scissors, carefully cut EVARREST to the size and shape as necessary to fit and \n\nmaintain contact with the bleeding area with an overlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm. Keep the \npowdery white-to-yellow colour active side of EVARREST facing down while in the tray. \n\n \n\n \n \n2. Remove excess blood or fluid from the site of application if required to improve visibility. The \n\nbleeding source should be clearly identified and it must be ensured that EVARREST is applied \ndirectly onto the bleeding source by covering it completely. EVARREST can be used in an \nactively bleeding field.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n3. Apply the active side of EVARREST to the bleeding area, allowing full contact with the tissue. \n\nThe product is activated upon contact with fluid, and adheres and conforms to tissue. \n \n\n \n \n4. Apply an appropriately sized piece of EVARREST to adequately cover the entire bleeding area, \n\nwith an overlap of approximately 1 to 2 cm onto non-bleeding tissue, to assist with adherence to \nthe wound site. \n\n \n\n \n \n5a) Hold dry or moist surgical gauze or laparotomy pads over EVARREST to achieve full contact \n\nwith the bleeding surface.  \n \n\n  \n \n5b) To ensure haemostasis, immediately apply manual compression over the entire surface of the \n\nEVARREST (including the area of overlap) sufficient to stem all bleeding. Maintain \ncompression for approximately 3 minutes, to control the bleeding.   \n\n \n\n \n \n6. Gently remove surgical gauze or laparotomy pads from the application site, without disrupting \n\nor dislodging EVARREST or the clot. Inspect EVARREST to verify that haemostasis has been \nachieved and to ensure that there is no crimping over the bleeding area. If not satisfied with the \nplacement, remove EVARREST and use a new EVARREST sealant matrix. EVARREST will \nremain in place and adhere to the tissue, and is absorbable. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n \n7. The application site should be monitored intraoperatively to verify that haemostasis is \n\nmaintained. \n \nRe-Treatment \n \n● Re-treatment may be required if there are folds, creases, or crimps in the EVARREST sealant \n\nmatrix. If not satisfied with the placement of EVARREST, remove the used EVARREST \nsealant matrix and repeat the application procedure above with a new EVARREST sealant \nmatrix. \n\n \n● If bleeding is due to insufficient coverage of the bleeding area, additional EVARREST sealant \n\nmatrices may be applied. Apply in a single layer; ensure that the edges overalap (by \napproximately 1 to 2 cm) with the existing EVARREST sealant matrix. \n\n \n● If bleeding is due to incomplete adherence to the tissue (where bleeding persists from under the \n\ndressing), remove EVARREST sealant matrix and use a new one. \n \n● If bleeding still occurs during or after the specified duration of compression, remove the used \n\nEVARREST sealant matrix and inspect the bleeding site. If no other primary haemostatic \nmeasures (i.e., standard surgical techniques) appear to be required, repeat the application \nprocedure above with a new EVARREST sealant matrix. \n\n \nDisposal \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
