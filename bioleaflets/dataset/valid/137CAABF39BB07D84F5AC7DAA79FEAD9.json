This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIDELVION 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nIDELVION 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nIDELVION 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nIDELVION 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nIDELVION 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nOne vial contains nominally 250 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with \nalbumin (rIX-FP), (INN = albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 2.5 ml water for injections \nthe solution contains 100 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa. \n \nIDELVION 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nOne vial contains nominally 500 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with \nalbumin (rIX-FP), (INN = albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 2.5 ml water for injections \nthe solution contains 200 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa. \n \nIDELVION 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nOne vial contains nominally 1000 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with \nalbumin (rIX-FP), (INN = albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 2.5 ml water for injections \nthe solution contains 400 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa. \n \nIDELVION 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nOne vial contains nominally 2000 IU of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with \nalbumin (rIX-FP), (INN = albutrepenonacog alfa). After reconstitution with 5 ml water for injections \nthe solution contains 400 IU/ml of albutrepenonacog alfa. \n \nThe potency (International Units [IU]) is determined using an in-vitro activated partial thromboplastin \ntime (aPTT)-based one-stage clotting assay calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) \nInternational Standard for factor IX concentrate.  \n \nAlbutrepenonacog alfa is a purified protein produced by recombinant DNA technology, generated by \nthe genetic fusion of recombinant albumin to recombinant coagulation factor IX. The genetic fusion of \nthe cDNA of human albumin to the cDNA of human coagulation factor IX enables the protein to be \nproduced as a single recombinant protein and assures product homogeneity by avoiding chemical \nconjugation. The recombinant factor IX portion is identical to the Thr148 allelic form of plasma-\nderived factor IX. The cleavable linker between the recombinant factor IX and albumin molecules is \nderived from the endogenous \u201cactivation peptide\u201d in native factor IX.  \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nUp to 25.8 mg (1.13 mmol) sodium per dose (bodyweight 70 kg). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nPale yellow to white powder and clear, colourless solvent for solution for injection. \n \npH: 6.6 - 7.2 \n \nOsmolality: \nIDELVION 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n175 \u2013 215 mOsm/kg. \n \nIDELVION 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n260 \u2013 300 mOsm/kg. \n \nIDELVION 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n260 \u2013 300 mOsm/kg. \n \nIDELVION 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n260 \u2013 300 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX \ndeficiency). \n \nIDELVION can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia \nB. \n \nPreviously untreated patients  \nThe safety and efficacy of IDELVION in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the \ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \nresponses to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \nanalysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable. \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nFactor IX activity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Measurement \nwith a one-stage clotting assay using a kaolin based aPTT reagent or Actin FS aPTT reagent will \nlikely result in an underestimation of activity level. This is of importance particularly when changing \nthe laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n \nPosology \nDose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on the \nlocation and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed \neither as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an \nInternational Standard for factor IX in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of \nnormal human plasma.  \n \nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International \nUnit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX by an \naverage of 1.3 IU/dl (1.3 % of normal) in patients \u2265 12 years of age and by 1.0 IU/dl (1.0 % of normal) \nin patients < 12 years of age. The required dose is determined using the following formulae: \n \nRequired dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (% of normal or IU/dl) x {reciprocal of \nobserved recovery (IU/kg per IU/dl)} \n \nExpected factor IX rise (IU/dl or % of normal) = Dose (IU) x Recovery (IU/dl per IU/kg)/body weight \n(kg) \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n \nPatients < 12 years of age \nFor an incremental recovery of 1 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (IU/dl) x 1 dl/kg \n \nExample  \n1. A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 20 kg patient with severe haemophilia B. The \n\nappropriate dose would be 20 kg x 50 IU/dl x 1 dl/kg = 1000 IUs. \n \n2. A dose of 1000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 25 kg patient, should be expected to result \n\nin a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 1000 IUs/25 kg x 1.0 (IU/dl per IU/kg) = 40 IU/dl \n(40 % of normal). \n\n \nPatients \u2265 12 years of age \nFor an incremental recovery of 1.3 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:  \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (IU/dl) x 0.77 dl/kg \n \nExample  \n3. A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 80 kg patient with severe haemophilia B.  The \n\nappropriate dose would be 80 kg x 50 IU/dl x 0.77 dl/kg = 3080 IUs. \n \n4. A dose of 2000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 80 kg patient, should be expected to result \n\nin a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 2000 IUs x 1.3 (IU/dl per IU/kg) \n/80 kg = 32.5 IU/dl (32.5 % of normal). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or in IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n\nDegree of Haemorrhage /  \nType of surgical procedure  \n\nFactor IX level \nrequired (%) (IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours) \n/ Duration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage  \nMinor or moderate Haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding (except iliopsoas) \nor oral bleeding  \n\n30 - 60 Single dose should be \nsufficient for majority of \nbleeds. Maintenance dose \nafter 24 \u2013 72 hours if there is \nfurther evidence of bleeding.  \n\nMajor haemorrhage \nLife threatening haemorrhages, \ndeep muscle bleeding including \niliopsoas  \n\n60 - 100 Repeat every 24 \u2013 72 hours \nfor the first week, and then \nmaintenance dose weekly \nuntil bleeding stops and \nhealing is achieved. \n\nMinor surgery  \nIncluding uncomplicated tooth \nextraction  \n\n50 \u2013 80 (initial level) Single dose may be sufficient \nfor a majority of minor \nsurgeries. If needed, \nmaintenance dose can be \nprovided after 24 \u2013 72 hours \nuntil bleeding stops and \nhealing is achieved.  \n\nMajor surgery  60 - 100 \n(initial level) \n\nRepeat every 24 \u2013 72 hours \nfor the first week, and then \nmaintenance dose 1 \u2013 2 times \nper week until bleeding stops \nand healing is achieved. \n\n \nProphylaxis  \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses are \n35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly. \nSome patients who are well-controlled on a once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg \non an interval of 10 or 14 days. For patients >18 years, further extension of the treatment interval may \nbe considered (see section 5.1). \n \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nAfter a bleeding episode during prophylaxis, patients should maintain their prophylaxis regimen as \nclosely as possible, with 2 doses of IDELVION being administered at least 24 hours apart but longer \nas deemed suitable for the patient. \n \nPaediatric population  \nFor routine prophylaxis, the recommended dose regimen is 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly (see sections \n5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration  \nIntravenous use.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nThe reconstituted preparation should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate comfortable for the \npatient up to a maximum of 5 ml/min. For detailed information regarding the administration of the \nreconstituted solution, see the instructions at the end of section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance (recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with \nalbumin (rIX-FP)) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown allergic reaction to hamster protein. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with IDELVION. The product contains traces of \nhamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use \nof the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the \nearly signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, \nwheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. It is recommended that the initial administration of factor IX \nshould be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could \nbe provided. \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nFormation of inhibitor to factor IX has been reported during factor replacement therapy with \nIDELVION in the treatment of haemophilia B. After repeated treatment with human coagulation \nfactor IX products, patients should be monitored for the development of neutralising antibodies \n(inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using appropriate biological testing.  \n \nThere have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX \ninhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated \nfor the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an \nincreased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.  \n \nBecause of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the initial administration of factor IX \nshould, according to the treating physician\u2019s judgement, be performed under medical observation \nwhere proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. \n \nThromboembolism  \nBecause of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of \nthrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when \nadministering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born \ninfants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit \nof treatment with IDELVION should be weighed against the risk of these complications. \n \nCardiovascular events \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications  \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n \nElderly \n\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical studies of IDELVION did not include subjects aged 65 and over. It is not known whether they \nrespond differently from younger subjects.  \n \nImmune tolerance induction \nThe safety and efficacy of using IDELVION for immune tolerance induction has not been established.  \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains up to 25.8 mg (1.13 mmol) sodium per dose (bodyweight 70 kg) if the \nmaximal dose (15 ml = 6000 IU) is applied. This is equivalent to 1.29% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of human coagulation factor IX products with other medicinal products have been \nreported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. Based on the rare occurrence of \nhaemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding is not available.  \n \nTherefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated. \n \nThere is no information on the effects of factor IX on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIDELVION has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these \nreactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association \nwith development of factor IX inhibitors (see also section 4.4). Nephrotic syndrome has been reported \nfollowing attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors \nand a history of allergic reaction.  \n \nWith the use of factor IX products obtained from CHO cells very rarely development of antibodies to \nhamster protein has been observed.  \n \nPatients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such \ninhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it \nis recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. Inhibitor development was \nreported in an ongoing clinical study with previously untreated patients. Inhibitor development has \nbeen observed in previously treated patients in the post-marketing experience with IDELVION. \nThere is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX \nproducts, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has \nbeen associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, \nvenous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with \nsuch adverse reactions. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nFive open label clinical studies included 114 subjects with at least one exposure to IDELVION \nreporting 14 adverse reactions in 8 subjects. \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n \n\nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reactions  Frequency per patient \n\nBlood and lymphatic disorders FIX inhibition/Inhibitor \n\ndevelopment \n\nNot known \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions Injection site reactions Common \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Common \nDizziness Common \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \nRash Uncommon \nEczema Uncommon \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nOne previously untreated patient (PUP) from the ongoing clinical trial developed high titre inhibitor \nagainst factor IX. There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs. \n \nPaediatric Population  \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar as in adults.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with IDELVION have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics: Blood coagulation factor IX.  \nATC code: B02BD04 \n \nMechanism of action \nIDELVION (INN: albutrepenonacog alfa) is a recombinant coagulation factor IX. Prolongation of the \nhalf-life of IDELVION and the enhanced systemic exposure are achieved by fusion with recombinant \nalbumin. Albumin is a natural, inert carrier protein in plasma with a half-life of approximately \n20 days. Genetic fusion of recombinant coagulation factor IX with albumin extends the half-life of \nfactor IX (see section 5.2). \nIDELVION remains intact in the circulation until factor IX is activated, whereupon albumin is \ncleaved, releasing activated factor IX (FIXa) when it is needed for coagulation.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nHaemophilia B is a sex linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously \nor as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is \nincreased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the \nbleeding tendencies. \n \nFactor IX is activated by factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor \nXIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor \nVIII, activates factor X. This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. \nThrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Factor IX activity is absent or \ngreatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required. \n \nGeneral information on clinical efficacy and safety \nA phase 1/2 study evaluated the treatment efficacy and prevention of bleeding episodes of rIX-FP \nin 17 subjects (ages 13-46 years), 13 subjects in the prophylaxis arm received weekly prophylaxis \nwith IDELVION for approximately 11 months, and 4 subjects in the on-demand arm received \nIDELVION upon occurrence of bleeding events. All 85 bleeding episodes were successfully \ntreated with 1 or 2 doses of IDELVION. \n \nThe efficacy of IDELVION has been evaluated in the open-label, uncontrolled part of a phase 2/3 \nstudy, in which a total of 63 male, previously treated patients (PTPs) between 12 and 61 years of \nage received IDELVION either for prophylaxis once every 7-, 10- and/or 14-day intervals and/or \nfor the treatment of bleeding episodes on an on-demand basis. All subjects had severe (FIX level \n<1%) or moderately severe (FIX level \u2264 2%) haemophilia B. Forty PTPs received IDELVION for \nprophylaxis. \n \nSubjects who received prophylactic treatment started with 35-50 IU/kg once weekly. A subgroup \nof patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10 or 14 days) with a recommended \ndose of 75 IU/kg and individual adjustments. 21 PTPs remained on the extended 14 day \nprophylaxis interval for additional treatment duration of 98 to 575 (median 386) days. From those \nsubjects, 8 (38%) experienced at least one bleeding during the 14 day-prophylaxis, while they had \nno bleeding events during once weekly prophylaxis. Median Annualised Bleeding Rate (ABR) on \n7 day prophylaxis with IDELVION for all bleeds was 0.0 (range 0-6) and on 14 day-prophylaxis it \nwas 1.08 (range 0-9.1).  \nThe long-term efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis treatment was confirmed in an open-\nlabel extension study for up to 5 years. In this study, a total of 59 PTPs \u226512 years (54 adults and 5 \nadolescents) received IDELVION either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of bleeding \nepisodes on an on-demand basis. \n \nPatients who received prophylactic treatment continued or started with 35-50 IU/kg once weekly. A \nsubgroup of patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10, 14 or 21 days) with a \nrecommended dose of 75 IU/kg (10 or 14 days) or 100 IU/kg (21 days). At the end of the study 14 \nPTPs (24%) were on the 7 day prophylaxis interval, and a total of 11 (19%), 25 (42%) and 9 (15%) \nPTPs remained on the extended prophylaxis interval of 10, 14 and 21 days, respectively. During the \n\n\n\n10 \n\nstudy, 2 PTPs (18%) in the 21-day regimen switched back to a more frequent dosing due to increased \nbleeding complications. The estimated median Annualised Bleeding Rates (ABRs) on 7-, 14-, and 21-\nday prophylaxis with IDELVION for all bleeds were 1.3 (range 0-8), 0.9 (range 0-13), and 0.3 (range \n0-5), respectively. \n \nCurrently available information support extension of treatment intervals for some patients though \npotentially associated with an increased risk for bleeding compared to a once weekly regimen.  \n \nOf note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different \nclinical studies. \n \nProphylaxis and control of bleeding in PTPs below 12 years \nThe efficacy of IDELVION has been evaluated in a phase 3 study, in which a total of 27 male \nPTPs between 1 and 10 years (median age 6.0 years) with 12 patients < 6 years, received \nIDELVION for prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. All 27 subjects received weekly \nprophylaxis treatment with IDELVION for a mean time on study of 13.1 months (9, 18 months). \n \nOf the 106 bleeding episodes, the majority (94; 88.7%) was treated with single injection, 103; \n97.2% were treated with 1-2 injections. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of a bleed was rated \nexcellent or good in 96% of all treated bleeding episodes. \n \nThe long-term efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis treatment was confirmed in an open-\nlabel extension study for up to 5 years. In the study, a total of 24 PTPs < 12 years received \nIDELVION either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of bleeding episodes on an on-demand \nbasis.  \nPatients who received prophylactic treatment continued with 35-50 IU/kg once weekly. A \nsubgroup of patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10 or 14 days) with a \nrecommended dose of 75 IU/kg. At the end of the study 17 PTPs (71%) were on the 7 day \nprophylaxis interval, and a total of 3 (12%), and 4 (17%) PTPs remained on the extended \nprophylaxis interval of 10 and 14 days, respectively. During the study, 4 PTPs (50%) in the 14-\nday regimen switched back to a more frequent dosing due to increased bleeding complications. \nThe estimated median Annualised Bleeding Rates (ABRs) for 7-, and 14-day prophylaxis with \nIDELVION for all bleeds were 2.0 (range 0-14), and 5.6 (range 0-8), respectively. \n \nPerioperative management:  \nThe safety and efficacy in the perioperative setting was evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 studies \nand a long-term extension study. The per protocol efficacy analysis includes 30 surgeries \nperformed in 21 patients between 5 and 58 years undergoing major or minor surgical, dental or \nother surgical invasive procedures. Dosing was individualized based on the subject\u2019s PK and \nclinical response to treatment. A single preoperative bolus ranging from 14 to 163 IU/kg was used \nin 96.7% (n=29) of surgeries. Haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent or good in all of the \nassessed procedures. During the 14-day postoperative period, patients received between 0 and 11 \ninfusions and total doses ranging from 0 to 444 IU/kg. \n \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIDELVION in previously untreated patients in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in \nhaemophilia B (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAdult population \nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of IDELVION were evaluated following an intravenous injection of a \nsingle dose of 25, 50 and 75 IU/kg. The PK parameters following a single injection of 50 IU/kg \nIDELVION (see table below) were based on plasma factor IX activity measured by the one-stage \nclotting assay. The mean factor IX activity at day 7 and day 14 was 13.76% and 6.10%, respectively, \n\n\n\n11 \n\nafter a single dose of 50 IU/kg IDELVION.

For \nidentification purpose, RFID emblem is included on the packages containing RFID tagged powder \nvials. \n \n\n \n \n \nPresentations \n \nEach pack contains: \n \nIDELVION 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection: \n1 vial with powder (with or without RFID tag) \n1 vial with 2.5 ml water for injections \n1 filter transfer device 20/20 \nOne inner box containing: \n1 disposable 5 ml syringe  \n1 venipuncture set \n2 alcohol swabs \n1 non-sterile plaster \n \nIDELVION 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n1 vial with powder (with or without RFID tag) \n1 vial with 2.5 ml water for injections \n1 filter transfer device 20/20 \nOne inner box containing: \n1 disposable 5 ml syringe \n1 venipuncture set \n2 alcohol swabs \n1 non-sterile plaster \n \nIDELVION 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n1 vial with powder (with or without RFID tag) \n1 vial with 2.5 ml water for injections \n1 filter transfer device 20/20 \nOne inner box containing: \n1 disposable 5 ml syringe  \n1 venipuncture set \n2 alcohol swabs \n1 non-sterile plaster \n \nIDELVION 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n1 vial with powder (with or without RFID tag) \n1 vial with 5 ml water for injections \n1 filter transfer device 20/20 \nOne inner box containing: \n1 disposable 10 ml syringe  \n1 venipuncture set \n\n\n\n14 \n\n2 alcohol swabs \n1 non-sterile plaster \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nGeneral instructions \n- The reconstituted solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless. After \n\nfiltering/withdrawal (see below) the reconstituted product should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  \n\n- Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits.  \n- Reconstitution and withdrawal must be carried out under aseptic conditions. \n \nReconstitution \nBring the solvent to room temperature (below 25 \u00b0C). Ensure product and solvent vial flip caps are \nremoved and the stoppers are treated with an antiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening \nthe Mix2Vial package. \n \n\n 1 \n\n1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do \nnot remove the Mix2Vial from the blister \npackage! \n\n 2 \n\n2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface \nand hold the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial \ntogether with the blister package and push the \nspike of the blue adapter end straight down \nthrough the solvent vial stopper. \n\n 3 \n\n3. Carefully remove the blister package from the \nMix2Vial set by holding at the rim, and pulling \nvertically upwards. Make sure that you only \npull away the blister package and not the \nMix2Vial set. \n\n 4 \n\n4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm \nsurface. Invert the solvent vial with the \nMix2Vial set attached and push the spike of the \ntransparent adapter end straight down \nthrough the product vial stopper. The solvent \nwill automatically flow into the product vial. \n\n 5 \n\n5. With one hand grasp the powder-side of the \nMix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the \nsolvent-side and unscrew the set carefully \ncounterclockwise into two pieces.  \nDiscard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial \nadapter attached. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n 6 \n\n6. Gently swirl the product vial with the \ntransparent adapter attached until the substance \nis fully dissolved. Do not shake. \n\n 7 \n\n7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While \nthe product vial is upright, connect the syringe \nto the Mix2Vial's Luer Lock fitting by screwing \nclockwise. Inject air into the product vial. \n\n \nWithdrawal and application \n \n\n 8 \n\n8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn \nthe system upside down and draw the solution \ninto the syringe by pulling the plunger back \nslowly. \n\n 9 \n\n9. Now that the solution has been transferred into \nthe syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the \nsyringe (keeping the syringe plunger facing \ndown) and disconnect the transparent Mix2Vial \nadapter from the syringe by unscrewing \ncounterclockwise. \n\n \nFor injection of IDELVION, only the provided administration sets should be used because treatment \nfailure can occur as a consequence of factor IX adsorption to the internal surface of some injection \nequipment. \n \nCare should be taken that no blood enters the syringe filled with product, as there is a risk that the \nblood could coagulate in the syringe and fibrin clots could therefore be administered to the patient.  \n \nThe IDELVION solution must not be diluted. \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be administered by slow intravenous injection either manually or via \nan optional RFID-controlled automated infusion pump. The rate of administration should be \ndetermined by the patient\u2019s comfort level, up to a maximum of 5 ml/min. In case of administration \nwith a RFID-controlled automated infusion pump the detailed handling instructions provided with the \npump should be followed. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n \n \n7.

What you need to know before you use IDELVION \n3. How to use IDELVION \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store IDELVION  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What IDELVION is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat is IDELVION? \n \nIDELVION is a haemophilia medicine that replaces a natural blood clotting (coagulation) factor IX. \nThe active substance in IDELVION is albutrepenonacog alfa (recombinant fusion protein linking \ncoagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX-FP)). \n \nFactor IX is involved in blood clotting. Patients with haemophilia B have a lack of this factor which \nmeans that their blood does not clot as quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. \nIDELVION works by replacing factor IX in haemophilia B patients to enable their blood to clot. \n \nWhat is IDELVION used for? \n \nIDELVION is used to prevent or to halt bleeding caused by the lack of factor IX in patients of all age \ngroups with haemophilia B (also called congenital factor IX deficiency or Christmas disease). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use IDELVION  \n \nDo not use IDELVION  \n\u2022 If you are allergic to the active ingredient (albutrepenonacog alfa) or any of the other ingredients \n\n(listed in section 6). \n\u2022 If you are allergic to hamster proteins. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IDELVION. \n \n\u2022 Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contains traces of hamster \n\nproteins (see also \u201cDo not use IDELVION\u201d). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, you \nshould stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should \ninform you of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions. These include hives, generalised \nskin rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure (hypotension), and anaphylaxis \n(a serious allergic reaction that causes severe difficulty in breathing, or dizziness). \n\n\u2022 Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial administration of \nIDELVION should be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for \nallergic reactions can be provided.  \n\n\u2022 The formation of inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) is a known complication that has been \nreported during treatment with IDELVION, which stops the treatment from working properly. If \nyour bleeding is not being controlled with IDELVION, tell your doctor immediately. You \nshould be monitored carefully for the development of inhibitors.  \n\n\u2022 If you suffer from liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had major surgery, please \ninform your doctor, as there is an increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications. \n\n\u2022 If you need a central venous access device (CVAD for injection of IDELVION), the risk of \ncomplications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of \na blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted should be considered \nby your doctor. \n\n \nOther medicines and IDELVION \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\u2022 If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\u2022 During pregnancy and breast-feeding, IDELVION should be given only if it is clearly needed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIDELVION does not effect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nIDELVION contains sodium \nIDELVION contains up to 25.8 mg (1.13 mmol) sodium per dose (bodyweight 70 kg) if the maximal \ndose (15 ml = 6000 IU) is applied. This is equivalent to 1.29% of the recommended maximum daily \ndietary intake of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) for an adult. \n \n \n \n3. How to use IDELVION  \n \nYour treatment should be started and monitored by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of \nblood clotting disorders. \n \nDose \n \nYour doctor will calculate the dose of IDELVION you need. The amount of IDELVION you need to \ntake and the duration of treatment depend on: \n\u2022 the severity of your disease \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\u2022 the site and intensity of the bleeding \n\u2022 your clinical condition and response \n\u2022 your body weight \n \nFollow the directions given to you by your doctor. \n \nIf you use more IDELVION than you should  \nPlease contact your doctor immediately if you inject more IDELVION than your doctor recommends. \n \nIf you stop using IDELVION  \nDo not stop using IDELVION without consulting your doctor. \n \nReconstitution and application \n \nGeneral Instructions \n\u2022 The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic \n\nconditions. \n\u2022 IDELVION must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in \n\nsection 6. \n\u2022 The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e. it might be \n\nsparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or \nwithdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked by eye, before it is used. Do not use the \nsolution if it is cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles. \n\n\u2022 Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements and as instructed by your doctor.  \n\n \nReconstitution \nWithout opening the vials, warm the IDELVION powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. \nThis can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them \nin your hands for a few minutes.  \nDO NOT expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 \u00b0C). \n \nCarefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an \nalcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter \ntransfer device), then follow the instructions given below. \n \n\n 1 \n\n1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do \nnot remove the Mix2Vial from the blister \npackage! \n\n 2 \n\n2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface \nand hold the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial \ntogether with the blister package and push the \nspike of the blue adapter end straight down \nthrough the solvent vial stopper. \n\n 3 \n\n3. Carefully remove the blister package from the \nMix2Vial set by holding at the rim, and pulling \nvertically upwards. Make sure that you only \npull away the blister package and not the \nMix2Vial set. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n 4 \n\n4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm \nsurface. Invert the solvent vial with the \nMix2Vial set attached and push the spike of the \ntransparent adapter end straight down \nthrough the product vial stopper. The solvent \nwill automatically flow into the product vial. \n\n 5 \n\n5. With one hand grasp the powder-side of the \nMix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the \nsolvent-side and unscrew the set carefully \ncounterclockwise into two pieces.  \nDiscard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial \nadapter attached. \n\n 6 \n\n6. Gently swirl the product vial with the \ntransparent adapter attached until the substance \nis fully dissolved. Do not shake. \n\n 7 \n\n7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While \nthe product vial is upright, connect the syringe \nto the Mix2Vial's Luer Lock fitting by screwing \nclockwise. Inject air into the product vial. \n\n \nWithdrawal and Application \n \n\n 8 \n\n8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn \nthe system upside down and draw the solution \ninto the syringe by pulling the plunger back \nslowly. \n\n 9 \n\n9. Now that the solution has been transferred into \nthe syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the \nsyringe (keeping the syringe plunger facing \ndown) and disconnect the transparent Mix2Vial \nadapter from the syringe by unscrewing \ncounterclockwise. \n\n \nUse the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back \nto the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. Inject \nthe reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 5 ml/min) either \nmanually or via an optional RFID-controlled automated infusion pump into the vein following \n\n\n\n44 \n\nthe instructions given to you by your doctor. In case of administration with a RFID-controlled \nautomated infusion pump the detailed handling instructions provided with the pump should be \nfollowed. Take care not to get any blood in the syringe containing the product.  \n \nCheck yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that \nmight be related to the administration of IDELVION, the injection should be stopped (see also \nsections 2 and 4). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPlease contact your doctor immediately: \n\u2022 if you notice symptoms of allergic reactions (see below)  \n\u2022 if you notice that the medicine stops working properly \n \nThe following side effects have been observed with factor IX medicines: \n\u2022 Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible and may include the following symptoms: \n\nhives, skin rashes (generalised urticaria), tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure \n(hypotension) and anaphylaxis (a serious reaction that causes severe difficulty in breathing or \ndizziness). If this happens, you should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n\u2022 Inhibitors: the medicine stops working properly (continuous bleeding). You may develop an \ninhibitor (neutralising antibody) to factor IX, in which case factor IX will not work properly any \nmore. If this happens, you should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor.  \n\n \nThe following side effects have been observed with IDELVION commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 \npeople): \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Injection site reactions \n\u2022 Dizziness \n \nThe following side effects occurred uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Allergic reactions (Hypersensitivity) \n\u2022 Rash \n\u2022 Eczema \n \nThe following side effects have been reported but it is not known how many people may be affected: \n\u2022 Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to IDELVION \n \n\u2022 Side effects in children and adolescents \nSide effects in children are expected to be the same as in adults.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed \neither as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an \nInternational Standard for factor IX in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of \nnormal human plasma.  \n \nOn demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International \nUnit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX by an \naverage of 1.3 IU/dl (1.3 % of normal) in patients \u2265 12 years of age and by 1.0 IU/dl (1.0 % of normal) \nin patients < 12 years of age. The required dose is determined using the following formulae: \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n48 \n\nRequired dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (% of normal or IU/dl) x {reciprocal of \nobserved recovery (IU/kg per IU/dl)} \n \nExpected factor IX rise (IU/dl or % of normal) = Dose (IU) x Recovery (IU/dl per IU/kg)/body weight \n(kg) \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n \nPatients < 12 years of age \nFor an incremental recovery of 1 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (IU/dl) x 1 dl/kg \n \nExample  \n1. A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 20 kg patient with severe haemophilia B. The \n\nappropriate dose would be 20 kg x 50 IU/dl x 1 dl/kg = 1000 IUs. \n \n2. A dose of 1000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 25 kg patient, should be expected to result \n\nin a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 1000 IUs/25 kg x 1.0 (IU/dl per IU/kg) = 40 IU/dl \n(40 % of normal). \n\n \nPatients \u2265 12 years of age \nFor an incremental recovery of 1.3 IU/dl per 1 IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows:  \nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (IU/dl) x 0.77 dl/kg \n \nExample  \n3. A peak level of 50 % of normal is required in a 80 kg patient with severe haemophilia B.  The \n\nappropriate dose would be 80 kg x 50 IU/dl x 0.77 dl/kg = 3080 IUs. \n \n4. A dose of 2000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 80 kg patient, should be expected to result \n\nin a peak post-injection factor IX increase of 2000 IUs x 1.3 (IU/dl per IU/kg) \n/80 kg = 32.5 IU/dl (32.5 % of normal). \n\n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or in IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n\nDegree of Haemorrhage /  \nType of surgical procedure  \n\nFactor IX level \nrequired (%) (IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours) \n/ Duration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage  \nMinor or moderate Haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding (except iliopsoas) \nor oral bleeding  \n\n30 - 60 Single dose should be \nsufficient for majority of \nbleeds. Maintenance dose \nafter 24 \u2013 72 hours if there is \nfurther evidence of bleeding.  \n\nMajor haemorrhage \nLife threatening haemorrhages, \ndeep muscle bleeding including \niliopsoas  \n\n60 - 100 Repeat every 24 \u2013 72 hours \nfor the first week, and then \nmaintenance dose weekly \nuntil bleeding stops and \nhealing is achieved. \n\nMinor surgery  \nIncluding uncomplicated tooth \nextraction  \n\n50 \u2013 80 (initial level) Single dose may be sufficient \nfor a majority of minor \nsurgeries. If needed, \nmaintenance dose can be \nprovided after 24 \u2013 72 hours \nuntil bleeding stops and \nhealing is achieved.  \n\n\n\n49 \n\nMajor surgery  60 - 100 \n(initial level) \n\nRepeat every 24 \u2013 72 hours \nfor the first week, and then \nmaintenance dose 1 \u2013 2 times \nper week until bleeding stops \nand healing is achieved. \n\n \nProphylaxis  \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia B, the usual doses are \n35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly. \nSome patients who are well-controlled on a once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg \non an interval of 10 or 14 days. For patients >18 years, further extension of the treatment interval may \nbe considered (see section 5.1). \n \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nAfter a bleeding episode during prophylaxis, patients should maintain their prophylaxis regimen as \nclosely as possible, with 2 doses of IDELVION being administered at least 24 hours apart but longer \nas deemed suitable for the patient. \n \nPaediatric population  \nFor routine prophylaxis , the recommended dose regimen is 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly (see sections \n5.1 and 5.2). \n \n \nSpecial warnings and precautions for use \n \nInhibitors  \nAfter repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX products, patients should be monitored for \nthe development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \nusing appropriate biological testing.  \n \nThere have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX \ninhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated \nfor the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an \nincreased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.  \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the \ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \nresponses to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \nanalysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable. \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nFactor IX activity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Measurement \nwith a one-stage clotting assay using a kaolin based aPTT reagent or Actin FS aPTT reagent will \nlikely result in an underestimation of activity level. This is of importance particularly when changing \nthe laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

clotting. patients with haemophilia b have a lack of this factor which means that their blood does not clot as quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. idelvion works by replacing factor ix in haemophilia b patients to enable their blood to clot. what is idelvion used for? idelvion is used to prevent or to halt bleeding caused by the lack of factor ix in patients of

idelvion", "Section_Content": "your treatment should be started and monitored by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of blood clotting disorders. dose your doctor will calculate the dose of idelvion you need. the amount of idelvion you need to take and the duration of treatment depend on: the severity of your disease 42 the site and intensity of the bleeding your clinical condition and response your body weight follow the directions given to you by your doctor. if you use more idelvion than you should please contact your doctor immediately if you inject more idelvion than your doctor recommends. if you stop using idelvion do not stop using idelvion without consulting your doctor. reconstitution and application general instructions the powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic conditions. idelvion must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in section 6. the solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e. it might be sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. after filtering or withdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked by eye, before it is used. do not use the solution if it is cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles. any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements and as instructed by your doctor. reconstitution without opening the vials, warm the idelvion powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. this can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them in your hands for a few minutes. do not expose the vials to direct heat. the vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 ). carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an alcohol swab. allow the vials to dry before opening the mix2vial package (which contains the filter transfer device), then follow the instructions given below. 1 1. open the mix2vial by peeling off the lid. do not remove the mix2vial from the blister package! 2 2. place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold the vial tight. take the mix2vial together with the blister package and push the spike of the blue adapter end straight down through the solvent vial stopper. 3 3. carefully remove the blister package from the mix2vial set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. make sure that you only pull away the blister package and not the mix2vial set. 4 4. place the powder vial on an even and firm surface. invert the solvent vial with the mix2vial set attached and push the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down through the product vial stopper. the solvent will automatically flow into the product vial. 5 5. with one hand grasp the powder-side of the mix2vial set and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and unscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two pieces. discard the solvent vial with the blue mix2vial adapter attached. 6 6. gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter attached until the substance is fully dissolved. do not shake. 7 7. draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. while the product vial is upright, connect the syringe to the mix2vial's luer lock fitting by screwing clockwise. inject air into the product vial. withdrawal and application 8 8. while keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly. 9 9. now that the solution has been transferred into the syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe (keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect the transparent mix2vial adapter from the syringe by unscrewing counterclockwise. use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. let blood flow back to the end of the tube. attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. inject the reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 5 ml/min) either manually or via an optional rfid-controlled automated infusion pump into the vein following 44 the instructions given to you by your doctor. in case of administration with a rfid-controlled automated infusion pump the detailed handling instructions provided with the pump should be followed. take care not to get any blood in the syringe containing the product. check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. if you have any side effects that might be related to the administration of idelvion, the injection should be stopped (see also sections 2 and 4). if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "idelvion", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "your treatment", "Type":
