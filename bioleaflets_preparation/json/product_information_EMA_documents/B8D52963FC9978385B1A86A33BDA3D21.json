Limited data in patients aged 75 years and older are \navailable. Varuby should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are \nlimited data in patients with severe renal impairment and no data in patients with end stage renal \ndisease undergoing haemodialysis. Varuby should be used with caution in these patients (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment. Varuby should be used with caution in these patients (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rolapitant in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole, with some water and may be taken with or without food. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nIn combination with St John’s wort (see section 4.5) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment \n \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Varuby should be used \nwith caution in these patients. If use cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored for adverse \nreactions to Varuby (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment \n \nThere are limited data in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Varuby should be \nused with caution in these patients. If use cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored for adverse \nreactions to Varuby (see section 4.8). \n \nInteractions \n \nVaruby is not recommended in patients who require chronic administration of strong (e.g. rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin) or moderate enzyme inducers (e.g. efavirenz, \nrifabutin) (see section 4.5) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of rolapitant with concurrent use of another NK1 receptor antagonist (e.g. \naprepitant and a combination of netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride) is not established and \ntherefore not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLactose \n \nVaruby contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of Varuby on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances \n \nCYP2D6 substrates \nRolapitant is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor. Increased plasma concentration of CYP2D6 substrates \nmay result in potential adverse reactions. A 3-fold increase in the exposure of dextromethorphan, a \nCYP2D6 substrate, was observed 7 days after a single oral dose of rolapitant and may last longer. \n \nTherefore, caution should be taken when rolapitant is combined with a medicinal product metabolised \nby CYP2D6, notably those having a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. propafenone, tamoxifen, \nmetoprolol used in heart failure, thioridazine, pimozide). \n \nUGT1A1 and UGT2B7 substrates (e.g. irinotecan and morphine, respectively) \nRolapitant modestly inhibited UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 in vitro. Therefore, the potential interactions \nassociated with the inhibition of these UGT enzymes in the intestine cannot be excluded.  \n \nBCRP substrates \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRolapitant is an inhibitor of Breast-Cancer-Resistance Protein (BCRP). Increased plasma \nconcentrations of BCRP substrates (e.g. methotrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, mitoxantrone, \nrosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, doxorubicin, bendamustine) may result in potential adverse reactions. Co-\nadministration of a single dose of 180 mg rolapitant with sulfasalazine, a BCRP substrate, resulted in \nan approximately 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC of sulfasalazine. If the combination cannot be \navoided, clinical and biological monitoring for adverse reactions related to the concomitant medicinal \nproduct must be made. The lowest effective dose of rosuvastatin is to be used. \n \nP-gp substrates \nRolapitant is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). A 70% increase in Cmax and 30% increase in AUC \nof digoxin, a P-gp substrate, were observed when administered with a single dose of 180 mg \nrolapitant. Therefore, clinical monitoring of adverse reactions and, if possible, biological monitoring \nare recommended when rolapitant is combined with digoxin or with other P-gp substrates (e.g. \ndabigatran or colchicine), and in particular in patients with renal impairment. \n \nOATP1B1 and 1B3 substrates \nIn vitro studies suggest that rolapitant is not expected to inhibit OATP1B1 at clinically relevant \nconcentrations and rolapitant is not an inhibitor of OATP1B3 at the tested concentrations up to 20 µM. \n \nOCT1 substrates \nIn vitro, rolapitant is not an inhibitor of OCT1 at the tested concentrations up to 20 µM. \n \nCYP3A4 substrates \nIn vivo, rolapitant is not expected to exhibit any inhibitory or inducing effect on CYP3A4. A single \ndose of 180 mg rolapitant had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam compared \nto oral midazolam 3 mg alone on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 11. \n \nOndansetron \nRolapitant had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous ondansetron when \nconcomitantly administered with a single 180 mg dose of rolapitant on the same day. \n \nDexamethasone \nRolapitant had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone when oral \ndexamethasone was administered on Days 1 to 3 after a single 180 mg dose of rolapitant was co-\nadministered on Day 1. \n \nOther CYPs \nNo clinically significant interaction is expected with the following medicinal products when \nadministered with a single dose of 180 mg rolapitant on Day 1 and without rolapitant on Day 8: \nrepaglinide 0.25 mg (a CYP2C8 substrate), efavirenz 600 mg (a CYP2B6 substrate), tolbutamide \n500 mg (a CYP2C9 substrate) or omeprazole 40 mg (a CYP2C19 substrate). \n \nRolapitant had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (a CYP1A2 substrate) when an oral dose \nof 200 mg caffeine was administered with a single dose of 180 mg rolapitant on Day 1, and without \nrolapitant on Day 8 and Day 15. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of Varuby \n \nEnzyme inducers \nConcomitant administration of rifampicin, a strong enzyme inducer significantly decreased the \nsystemic exposure to rolapitant and to its active metabolite. When 600 mg rifampicin was \nadministered once daily for 7 days before and 7 days after administration of a single dose of 180 mg \nrolapitant, the mean AUC was reduced by 87% and its active metabolite by 89% compared to \nadministration of rolapitant alone. Varuby in patients who require chronic administration of strong \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, phenytoin) is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe effect of moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz, rifabutin) is not established; therefore, the use of \nrolapitant in patients already given a moderate inducer is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nDue to its strong inducing effect, St John’s wort is contraindicated with rolapitant (see section 4.3). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nNo clinically significant effect was seen on the pharmacokinetics of rolapitant when ketoconazole, a \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor was administered with rolapitant. Concurrent administration of 400 mg \nketoconazole once daily for 21 days following a single 90 mg dose of rolapitant, did not significantly \naffect the Cmax of rolapitant while the AUC increased by 21%. This is not expected to be clinically \nrelevant. \n \nOther interactions \n \nThe efficacy and safety of rolapitant with concurrent use of another NK1 receptor antagonist (e.g. \naprepitant and a combination of netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride) is not established and \ntherefore not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available data on rolapitant use in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown no \nteratogenic or embryo-foetal effects. In the pre- and postnatal developmental study, at a dose \nequivalent to half of the recommended human dose, there was a decrease in memory in female pups in \na maze test and a decrease in pup body weight (see section 5.3). Varuby should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no data on the presence of rolapitant in human milk. Rolapitant administered orally to \nlactating female rats was present in milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with \nVaruby. \n \nFertility \n \nRolapitant did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance of male rats. Decreases in \nthe number of corpora lutea and implantation sites were observed in the female rat fertility and early \nembryonic development study (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVaruby has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

In case \nof overdose, the medicinal product should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and \nmonitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of rolapitant, emesis induced by a \nmedicinal product may not be effective. Dialysis studies have not been performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, other antiemetics, ATC code: A04AD14 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRolapitant is a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nCisplatin-Based Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) \n \nStudy 1 and Study 2 (HEC) \n \nIn two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, controlled clinical studies (Study 1 and \nStudy 2), the rolapitant regimen (180 mg rolapitant, 10 mcg/kg intravenous granisetron and 20 mg oral \ndexamethasone) was compared with control therapy (placebo, 10 mcg/kg intravenous granisetron and \n20 mg oral dexamethasone) on Day 1 in patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included \ncisplatin ≥60 mg/m2. On Day 2 to 4, patients received 8 mg twice daily of oral dexamethasone. Study \nmedicinal products were administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 at the following intervals: \nrolapitant (1 to 2 hours prior); granisetron and dexamethasone (30 minutes prior). \n \nA total of 1087 patients were randomised to either the rolapitant regimen (N=544) or control therapy \n(N=543) across Study 1 and Study 2; 1070 patients were included in the evaluation of efficacy; 37% \nwere women and 63% were men. Of the 1070 patients, 26% were greater than 65 years of age and 3% \nwere greater than 75 years of age. \n \nThe primary endpoint in both studies was complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no \nrescue medicinal product) in the delayed phase (>24 to 120 hours) of chemotherapy-induced nausea \nand vomiting.

On Day 2 to 3, patients received 2 mg once daily of oral granisetron. Study \nmedicinal products were administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 at the following intervals: \nrolapitant (1 to 2 hours prior); granisetron and dexamethasone (30 minutes prior). At the time the \nstudy was designed, AC containing chemotherapy regimens were considered to be moderately \nemetogenic. Recent guidance has updated these regimens to highly emetogenic. The percentage of \npatients who received carboplatin in Cycle 1 was 30%. \n \nA total of 1369 patients were randomised to either the rolapitant regimen (N=684) or control therapy \n(N=685). A total of 1332 patients were included in the evaluation of efficacy, 80% were women and \n20% were men. Of these 1332 patients, 28% were greater than 65 years of age and 6% were greater \nthan 75 years of age. Of these 1332 patients, 629 received non-AC chemotherapy. \n \nThe primary endpoint was complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medicinal \nproduct) in the delayed phase (>24 to 120 hours) of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

The proportion of patients with no impact on daily life was higher in the Varuby \ngroup than in the control group (MEC: 73.2% vs. 67.4%; p=0.027). \n \nMultiple-Cycle Extension: In each study, patients had the option of continuing into a multiple-cycle \nextension for up to 5 additional cycles of chemotherapy receiving the same treatment as assigned in \ncycle 1. At Day 6 to 8 following initiation of chemotherapy, patients were asked to recall whether they \nhad any episode of vomiting or retching or nausea that interfered with normal daily life. Antiemetic \nactivity of rolapitant was maintained throughout repeat cycles for those patients continuing in each of \nthe multiple cycles. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrolapitant in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of acute and delayed nausea and \nvomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cisplatin-based cancer \ntherapy and moderately emetogenic cancer therapy (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRolapitant displays linear PK with exposures increased in a dose-proportional manner. Rolapitant is \nslowly eliminated with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 7 days. Rolapitant is eliminated \nmainly through the hepatobiliary route, with minor contributions from renal elimination. Rolapitant is \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 to form a major active metabolite, M19. In vitro studies suggest that \nrolapitant is not an inhibitor of CYP2E1. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing a single dose administration of 180 mg rolapitant under fasting conditions to healthy \nsubjects, rolapitant was measurable in plasma between 30 minutes and the peak plasma concentration \n(Cmax) for rolapitant which was reached in about 4 hours and mean Cmax was 968 ng/mL (%CV:28%). \n\np<0.001 for the between-group comparison \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nFollowing multiple oral doses 9 to 45 mg once daily of rolapitant; accumulation of rolapitant was \napproximately 5-fold. \n \nThe systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to rolapitant increased in a dose-proportional manner when \nthe dose of rolapitant increased from 4.5 mg to 180 mg. With an increase in dose by 4 times from the \nrecommended clinical dose of 180 mg, the Cmax and AUC of rolapitant increased by 3.1 fold and \n3.7 fold, respectively. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of rolapitant is approximately 100%, indicating minimal first pass effect. \n \nConcomitant administration of a high fat meal did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of \nrolapitant after administration of 180 mg rolapitant. \n \nDistribution \n \nRolapitant was highly protein bound to human plasma (99.8%). The apparent volume of distribution \n(Vd/F) was 460 L in healthy subjects, indicating an extensive tissue distribution of rolapitant. In a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of rolapitant, the Vd/F was 387 L in cancer patients. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRolapitant is metabolised by CYP3A4 to form a major active metabolite, M19 (C4-pyrrolidine-\nhydroxylated rolapitant). In a mass balance study, the metabolite M19 was the major circulating \nmetabolite. The formation of M19 was significantly delayed with the median Tmax of 120 hours (range: \n24-168 hours) and the mean half-life of M19 was 158 hours. The exposure ratio of M19 to rolapitant \nwas approximately 50% in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing single oral doses (4.5 to 180 mg) of rolapitant, the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) of rolapitant \nranged from 169 to 183 hours (approximately 7 days) and was independent of dose. In a population \npharmacokinetic analysis the apparent total clearance (CL/F) of rolapitant was 0.96 L/hour in cancer \npatients. \n \nRolapitant is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary route. Following administration of a \nsingle oral 180-mg dose of [14C]-rolapitant, on average 14.2% (range 9% to 20%) and 73% (range \n52% to 89%) of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively over 6 weeks. In pooled \nsamples collected over 2 weeks, 8.3% of the dose was recovered in the urine primarily as metabolites \nand 37.8% of the dose was recovered in the feces primarily as unchanged rolapitant. Unchanged \nrolapitant or M19 were not found in pooled urine sample. Drug metabolising enzymes (and drug \ntransporters) other than CYP3A4 involved in rolapitant hepatobiliary elimination remain to be \nelucidated. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, Sex and Race/Ethnicity \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that age, sex and race had no significant impact on the \npharmacokinetics of Varuby. There are limited data in patients aged 75 years and older. \n \nHepatic Impairment \nFollowing administration of a single dose of 180 mg rolapitant to patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the pharmacokinetics of rolapitant were comparable with those of \nhealthy subjects. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the mean Cmax \nwas 25% lower while mean AUC of rolapitant was similar compared to those of healthy subjects. The \nmedian Tmax for M19 was delayed to 204 hours in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n \n\ncompared to 168 hours in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of Varuby was not studied in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \n \nRenal Impairment \nIn population pharmacokinetic analyses, creatinine clearance (CLcr) at baseline did not show a \nsignificant effect on rolapitant pharmacokinetics in cancer patients with mild (CLcr: 60 to 90 mL/min) \nor moderate (CLcr: 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment compared to cancer patients with normal \nkidney function. Information is insufficient for the effect of severe renal impairment. The \npharmacokinetics of Varuby was not studied in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring \nhaemodialysis. \n \nRelationship between concentration and effect \n \nNK1 Receptor Occupancy \nA human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study with rolapitant demonstrated that rolapitant \ncrosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors. A dose-dependent increase in mean \nNK1 receptor occupancy was observed in the dose range from 4.5 mg to 180 mg of rolapitant. At \nrolapitant plasma concentrations of >15 ng/mL and 348 ng/mL, the NK1 receptor occupancies in the \ncortical regions were approximately >50% and 90% respectively. At the 180 mg dose of rolapitant, the \nmean NK1 receptor occupancy in the cortical regions was greater than 90% for at least 120 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity, teratogenic potential, and carcinogenic potential. \n \nThe mechanism of the significant difference of half-lives observed between the rat and monkey (6-8 h) \nand human (7 days) is not elucidated. \n \nIn rodents, rolapitant was tested in repeated dose oral toxicity studies up to 26 weeks in duration, and \nthe liver, thyroid, kidneys, epididymis and uterus were identified as target organs. In a three-month rat \nstudy, clonic convulsions were observed in a single animal at 125 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times \nthe recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In the one-month monkey study, \nconvulsions were observed at 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 5.8 times the recommended human dose \non a body surface area basis). The relevance of convulsions for humans is unknown. \n \nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, rolapitant hydrochloride at an oral \ndose equivalent to 9 mg/kg per day free base (approximately 0.5 times the recommended human dose \non a body surface area basis) caused a transient decrease in maternal body weight gain and increases \nin the incidence of pre- and post-implantation loss. At a dose equivalent to 4.5 mg/kg per day free base \n(approximately 0.2 times the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), there were \ndecreases in the number of corpora lutea and implantation sites. \n \nIn a pre- and post-natal development rat study, maternal toxicity was evident based on \nmortality/moribund condition, decreased body weight and food consumption, total litter loss, \nprolonged parturition, decreased length of gestation, and increased number of unaccounted for \nimplantation sites at a dose equivalent to 22.5 mg/kg per day free base (approximately 1.2 times the \nrecommended human dose on a body surface area basis). Effects on offspring at this dose included \ndecreased postnatal survival, and decreased body weights and body weight gain, and may be related to \nthe maternal toxicity observed. At a maternal dose equivalent to 9 mg/kg per day rolapitant free base \n(approximately 0.5 times the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), there was a \ndecrease in memory in female pups in a maze test and a decrease in pup body weight. \n \nBased on the environmental risk assessment, rolapitant is considered as very persistent, \nbioaccumulative and not readily biodegradable. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n6.

What Varuby is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Varuby is \nVaruby contains the active substance rolapitant. \n  \nWhat Varuby is used for \nVaruby is used to help prevent adults with cancer feeling sick (nauseous) or being sick (vomiting) \nwhile having cancer treatment chemotherapy. \n \nHow Varuby works \nChemotherapy can cause the body to release “substance P.” \nSubstance P attaches to nerve cells in the brain’s vomiting centre and makes you feel sick or be sick. \nRolapitant, the active substance in Varuby, blocks substance P from attaching to these nerve cells and \nthis helps prevent nausea and vomiting. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Varuby \n \nDo not take Varuby: \n- if you are allergic to rolapitant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you take an herbal medicine called St John’s wort (Hypericum performatum), used to treat \n\ndepression and difficulty sleeping (see section 2 under ‘Other medicines and Varuby’). \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine if: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n- you have severe liver or kidney problems \n- you need to take certain medicines which may reduce the effectiveness of Varuby, such as: \n\n- rifampicin, to treat tuberculosis and other infections \n- carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy and nerve pain \n- phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy \n- enzalutamide, to treat prostate cancer \n- phenytoin, to treat epilepsy \n- efavirenz, to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \n- rifabutin, to treat tuberculosis and other infections \n- other medicines that contain an NK1 antagonist, such as aprepitant and a combination of \n\nnetupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride (for the prevention of nausea and vomiting \nassociated with cancer chemotherapy) (see section 2 under ‘Other medicines and Varuby’) \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nVaruby should not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years because it has not been studied \nin this group. \n \nOther medicines and Varuby \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.
