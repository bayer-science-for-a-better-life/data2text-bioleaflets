Any dose \nincrease to 50 mg should be made on an individual patient benefit/risk basis and with strict respect of \nLiver Function Test monitoring. \n \nLiver function tests should be performed in all patients before starting treatment. Treatment should not \nbe initiated if transaminases exceed 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nDuring treatment transaminases should be monitored  periodically after around three weeks, six weeks \n(end of acute phase), twelve weeks and twenty four weeks (end of maintenance phase) and thereafter \nwhen clinically indicated (see also section 4.4). Treatment should be discontinued if transaminases \nexceed 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nWhen increasing the dosage, liver function tests should again be performed at the same frequency as \nwhen initiating treatment. \n \nTreatment duration \nPatients with depression should be treated for a sufficient period of at least 6 months to ensure that \nthey are free of symptoms. \n \nSwitching therapy from SSRI/SNRI antidepressant to agomelatine \nPatients may experience discontinuation symptoms after cessation from an SSRI/ SNRI \nantidepressant. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe SmPC of the actual SSRI/SNRI should be consulted on how to withdraw the treatment to avoid \nthis. Agomelatine can be started immediately while tapering the dosage of a SSRI//SNRI (see section \n5.1). \n \nTreatment discontinuation \nNo dosage tapering is needed on treatment discontinuation. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe efficacy and safety of agomelatine (25 to 50mg/day) have been established in elderly depressed \npatients (< 75years). No effect is documented  in patients ≥75 years. Therefore, agomelatine should \nnot be used by patients in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). No dose adjustment is required in \nrelation to age (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nNo relevant modification in agomelatine pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal \nimpairment has been observed. However, only limited clinical data on the use of agomelatine in \ndepressed patients with severe or moderate renal impairment with major depressive episodes is \navailable. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine to these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nAgomelatine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of agomelatine in children from 2 years onwards for treatment of major \ndepressive episodes have not yet been established. No data are available (see section 4.4). \nThere is no relevant use of agomelatine in children from birth to 2 years for treatment of major \ndepressive episodes. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \nValdoxan film-coated tablets may be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nHepatic impairment (i.e. cirrhosis or active liver disease) or transaminases exceeding 3 X upper limit \nof normal (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nConcomitant use of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring of liver function \n \nCases of liver injury, including hepatic failure (few cases were exceptionally reported with fatal \noutcome or liver transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors), elevations of liver enzymes \nexceeding 10 times upper limit of normal, hepatitis and jaundice have been reported in patients treated \nwith agomelatine in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred during the \nfirst months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage is predominantly hepatocellular with increased \nserum transaminases, which usually return to normal levels on cessation of agomelatine.  \n \nCaution should be exercised before starting treatment and close surveillance should be \nperformed throughout the treatment period in all patients, especially if hepatic injury risk \nfactors or concomitant medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury are present. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nBefore starting treatment  \nTreatment with Valdoxan should only be prescribed after careful consideration of benefit and risk in \npatients with hepatic injury risk factors e.g.: \n\n-  obesity/overweight/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes \n- alcohol use disorder and /or substantial alcohol intake  \n\nand in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury.  \nBaseline liver function tests should be undertaken in all patients and treatment should not be initiated \nin patients with baseline values of ALT and/or AST >3 X upper limit of normal (see section 4.3). \nCaution should be exercised when Valdoxan is administered to patients with pretreatment elevated \ntransaminases (> the upper limit of the normal ranges and ≤3 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange). \n \n• Frequency of liver function tests  \n- before starting treatment \n- and then: \n\n- after around 3 weeks,  \n- after around 6 weeks (end of acute phase), \n- after around 12 and 24 weeks (end of maintenance phase),  \n- and thereafter when clinically indicated. \n\n- When increasing the dosage, liver function tests should again be performed at the same \nfrequency as when initiating treatment. \n \n\nAny patient who develops increased serum transaminases should have his/her liver function tests \nrepeated within 48 hours. \n\n \nDuring treatment period \nValdoxan treatment should be discontinued immediately if: \n\n‐ patient develops symptoms or signs of potential liver injury (such as dark urine, light \ncoloured stools, yellow skin/eyes, pain in the upper right belly, sustained new-onset and \nunexplained fatigue). \n\n‐ the increase in serum transaminases exceeds 3 X upper limit of normal. \n \nFollowing discontinuation of Valdoxan therapy liver function tests should be repeated until serum \ntransaminases return to normal. \n \nUse in paediatric population  \n \nValdoxan is not recommended in the treatment of depression in patients under 18 years of age since \nsafety and efficacy of Valdoxan have not been established in this age group. In clinical trials among \nchildren and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt \nand suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) \nwere more frequently observed compared to those treated with placebo (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \nNo effect of agomelatine is documented in patients ≥75 years, therefore agomelatine should not be \nused by patients in this age group (see also sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nUse in elderly with dementia \n \nValdoxan should not be used for the treatment of major depressive episodes in elderly patients with \ndementia since the safety and efficacy of Valdoxan have not been established in these patients. \n \nBipolar disorder/ mania / hypomania \n \nValdoxan should be used with caution in patients with a history of bipolar disorder, mania or \nhypomania and should be discontinued if a patient develops manic symptoms (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nSuicide/suicidal thoughts \n \nDepression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-\nrelated events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur \nduring the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such \nimprovement occurs. It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early \nstages of recovery. \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials of antidepressants in adult patients with psychiatric disorders showed an \nincreased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo, in patients less than 25 \nyears old. \nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany treatment \nespecially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should \nbe alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and \nunusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. \n \nCombination with CYP1A2 inhibitors (see sections 4.3 and 4.5)  \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Valdoxan with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. \npropranolol, enoxacin) which may result in increased exposure of agomelatine. \n \nLactose intolerance \n \nValdoxan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nLevel of sodium \n \nValdoxan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential interactions affecting agomelatine \n \nAgomelatine is metabolised mainly by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (90%) and by CYP2C9/19 \n(10%). Medicinal products that interact with these isoenzymes may decrease or increase the \nbioavailability of agomelatine.  \nFluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor markedly inhibits the metabolism of \nagomelatine resulting in a 60-fold (range 12-412) increase of agomelatine exposure. \nConsequently, co-administration of Valdoxan with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, \nciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. \nCombination of agomelatine with oestrogens (moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors) results in a several fold \nincreased exposure of agomelatine. While there was no specific safety signal in the 800 patients \ntreated in combination with oestrogens, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine \nwith other moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. propranolol, enoxacin) until more experience has been \ngained (see section 4.4). \nRifampicin an inducer of all three cytochromes involved in the metabolism of agomelatine may \ndecrease the bioavailability of agomelatine. \nSmoking induces CYP1A2 and has been shown to decrease the bioavailability of agomelatine, \nespecially in heavy smokers (> 15 cigarettes/day) (see section 5.2). \n \nPotential for agomelatine to affect other medicinal products \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nIn vivo, agomelatine does not induce CYP450 isoenzymes. Agomelatine inhibits neither CYP1A2 in \nvivo nor the other CYP450 in vitro. Therefore, agomelatine will not modify exposure to medicinal \nproducts metabolised by CYP 450. \n \n \nOther medicinal products \n \nNo evidence of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with medicinal products which \ncould be prescribed concomitantly with Valdoxan in the target population was found in phase I \nclinical trials: benzodiazepines, lithium, paroxetine, fluconazole and theophylline.  \n \nAlcohol \n \nThe combination of agomelatine and alcohol is not advisable. \n \nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) \n \nThere is no experience of concurrent use of agomelatine with ECT. Animal studies have not shown \nproconvulsant properties (see section 5.3). Therefore, clinical consequences of ECT performed \nconcomitantly with agomelatine treatment, are considered to be unlikely. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of \nagomelatine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with \nrespect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section \n5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Valdoxan during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether agomelatine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of agomelatine/metabolites in \nmilk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Valdoxan therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nReproduction studies in the rat and the rabbit showed no effect of agomelatine on fertility (see section \n5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n Agomelatine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.Considering that dizziness \nand somnolence are common adverse reactions, patients should be cautioned about their ability to \ndrive or operate machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nAdverse reactions were usually mild or moderate and occurred within the first two weeks of treatment. \nThe most common adverse reactions were headache, nausea and dizziness. \nThese adverse reactions were usually transient and did not generally lead to cessation of therapy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe below table gives the adverse reactions observed from placebo-controlled and active-controlled \nclinical trials. \nAdverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). The frequencies have not been \ncorrected for placebo. \n \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Preferred Term \nPsychiatric disorders Common Anxiety \n\nAbnormal dreams* \nUncommon Suicidal thoughts or behaviour (see section \n\n4.4) \nAgitation and related symptoms* (such as \nirritability and restlessness) \nAggression* \nNightmares* \nMania/hypomania* \nThese symptoms may also be due to the \nunderlying disease (see section 4.4). \n\n Confusional state* \nRare Hallucinations* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Headache \nCommon Dizziness \n\nSomnolence \nInsomnia \n\nUncommon Migraine \nParaesthesia \nRestless leg syndrome* \n\nRare Akathisia* \nEye disorders Uncommon Blurred vision \nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Tinnitus* \n\nGastrointestinal \nDisorders \n \n\nCommon Nausea \nDiarrhoea \nConstipation \nAbdominal pain \nVomiting* \n\nHepato- biliary \ndisorders \n\nCommon Increased ALT and/or AST (in clinical trials, \nincreases >3 times the upper limit of the \nnormal range for ALT and/or AST were seen \nin 1.2% of patients on agomelatine 25 mg \ndaily and 2.6 % on agomelatine 50 mg daily \nvs. 0.5% on placebo). \n\nUncommon Increased gamma-glutamyltransferase* \n(GGT)(>3 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange \n\nRare Hepatitis \nIncreased alkaline phosphatase* \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n(>3 times the upper limit of the normal range)  \nHepatic failure*(1) \nJaundice* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Hyperhidrosis \nEczema \nPruritus* \nUrticaria* \n\nRare Erythematous rash \nFace oedema and angioedema* \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Back pain \n\nUncommon Myalgia* \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nRare Urinary retention* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon Fatigue  \n\nInvestigations Common Weight increased *  \nUncommon  Weight decreased* \n\n* Frequency estimated from clinical trials for adverse reactions detected from spontaneous report \n(1) Few cases were exceptionally reported with fatal outcome or liver transplantation in patients with \nhepatic risk factors. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThere is limited experience with agomelatine overdose. Experience with agomelatine in overdose has \nindicated that epigastralgia, somnolence, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, tension, dizziness, cyanosis or \nmalaise have been reported.  \nOne person having ingested 2,450 mg agomelatine, recovered spontaneously without cardiovascular \nand biological abnormalities. \n \nManagement \n \nNo specific antidotes for agomelatine are known. Management of overdose should consist of treatment \nof clinical symptoms and routine monitoring. Medical follow-up in a specialised environment is \nrecommended. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics, other antidepressants, ATC-code: N06AX22 \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nAgomelatine is a melatonergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and 5-HT2C antagonist. Binding \nstudies indicate that agomelatine has no effect on monoamine uptake and no affinity for α, β \nadrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and benzodiazepine receptors. \nAgomelatine resynchronises circadian rhythms in animal models of circadian rhythm disruption. \nAgomelatine increases noradrenaline and dopamine release specifically in the frontal cortex and has \nno influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAgomelatine has shown an antidepressant-like effect in animal models of depression (learned \nhelplessness test, despair test, chronic mild stress) as well as in models with circadian rhythm \ndesynchronisation and in models related to stress and anxiety.  \nIn humans, agomelatine has positive phase shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, \nbody temperature decline and melatonin onset. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of agomelatine in major depressive episodes have been studied in a clinical \nprogramme including 7,900 patients treated with agomelatine.  \nTen placebo controlled trials have been performed to investigate the short term efficacy of \nagomelatine in major depressive disorder in adults, with fixed dose and/or dose up-titration. At the end \nof treatment (over 6 or 8 weeks), significant efficacy of agomelatine 25-50 mg was demonstrated in 6 \nout of the ten short-term double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Primary endpoint was change in \nHAMD-17 score from baseline. Agomelatine failed to differentiate from placebo in two trials where \nthe active control, paroxetine or fluoxetine showed assay sensitivity. Agomelatine was not compared \ndirectly with paroxetine and fluoxetine as these comparators where added in order to ensure assay \nsensitivity of the trials. In two other trials, it was not possible to draw any conclusions because the \nactive controls, paroxetine or fluoxetine, failed to differentiate from placebo. However, in these \nstudies it was not allowed to increase the start dose of either agomelatine, paroxetine or fluoxetine \neven if the response was not adequate. \nEfficacy was also observed in more severely depressed patients (baseline HAM-D ≥ 25) in all positive \nplacebo-controlled trials. \nResponse rates were statistically significantly higher with agomelatine compared with placebo. \nSuperiority (2 trials) or non-inferiority (4 trials) has been shown in six out of seven efficacy trials in \nheterogeneous populations of depressed adult patients versus SSRI/SNRI (sertraline, escitalopram, \nfluoxetine, venlafaxine or duloxetine) The anti-depressive effect was assessed with the HAMD-17 \nscore either as primary or secondary endpoint. \nThe maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse prevention trial. Patients \nresponding to 8/10-weeks of acute treatment with open-label agomelatine 25-50 mg once daily were \nrandomised to either agomelatine 25-50 mg once daily or placebo for further 6-months. \nAgomelatine 25-50 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant superiority compared to \nplacebo (p=0.0001) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, as \nmeasured by time to relapse. The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow up \nperiod was 22% and 47% for agomelatine and placebo, respectively. \n \nAgomelatine does not alter daytime vigilance and memory in healthy volunteers. In depressed \npatients, treatment with agomelatine 25 mg increased slow wave sleep without modification of REM \n(Rapid Eye Movement) sleep amount or REM latency. Agomelatine 25 mg also induced an advance of \nthe time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and \nthe quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.  \n \nIn a specific sexual dysfunction comparative trial with remitted depressed patients, there was a \nnumerical trend (not statistically significant) towards less sexual emergent dysfunction than \nvenlafaxine for Sex Effects Scale (SEXFX) drive arousal or orgasm scores on agomelatine. The \npooled analysis of trials using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) showed that agomelatine \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nwas not associated with sexual dysfunction. In healthy volunteers agomelatine preserved sexual \nfunction in comparison with paroxetine. \n \nAgomelatine had neutral effect on heart rate and blood pressure in clinical trials. \n \nIn a trial designed to assess discontinuation symptoms by the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and \nSymptoms (DESS) check-list in patients with remitted depression, agomelatine did not induce \ndiscontinuation syndrome after abrupt treatment cessation. \nAgomelatine has no abuse potential as measured in healthy volunteer studies on a specific visual \nanalogue scale or the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) 49 check-list. \nA placebo-controlled 8-week trial of agomelatine 25-50mg/day in elderly depressed patients (≥ 65 \nyears, N=222, of which 151 on agomelatine) demonstrated a statistically significant difference of 2.67 \npoints on HAM-D total score, the primary outcome. Responder rate analysis favoured agomelatine. No \nimprovement was observed in very elderly patients (≥75 years, N= 69, of which 48 on agomelatine). \nTolerability of agomelatine in elderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults. \n \nA specific controlled, 3-week trial has been conducted in patients suffering from major depressive \ndisorder and insufficiently improved with paroxetine (a SSRI) or venlafaxine (a SNRI). When \ntreatment was switched from these antidepressants to agomelatine, discontinuation symptoms arose \nafter cessation of the SSRI or SNRI treatment, either after abrupt cessation or gradual cessation of the \nprevious treatment. These discontinuation symptoms may be confounded with a lack of early benefit \nof agomelatine. \nThe percentage of patients with at least one discontinuation symptom one week after the SSRI/SNRI \ntreatment stop, was lower in the long tapering group (gradual cessation of the previous SSRI/SNRI \nwithin 2 weeks) than in the short tapering group (gradual cessation of the previous SSRI/SNRI within \n1 week) and in the abrupt substitution group (abrupt cessation): 56.1%, 62.6 % and 79.8% \nrespectively.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nagomelatine in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of major depressive \nepisodes (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and bioavailability \n \nAgomelatine is rapidly and well (≥ 80%) absorbed after oral administration. Absolute bioavailability is \nlow (< 5% at the therapeutic oral dose) and the interindividual variability is substantial. The \nbioavailability is increased in women compared to men. The bioavailability is increased by intake of \noral contraceptives and reduced by smoking. The peak plasma concentration is reached within 1 to 2 \nhours. \n \nIn the therapeutic dose-range, agomelatine systemic exposure increases proportionally with dose. At \nhigher doses, a saturation of the first-pass effect occurs. \nFood intake (standard meal or high fat meal) does not modify the bioavailability or the absorption rate. \nThe variability is increased with high fat food. \n \nDistribution \n \nSteady state volume of distribution is about 35 l and plasma protein binding is 95% irrespective of the \nconcentration and is not modified with age and in patients with renal impairment but the free fraction \nis doubled in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nFollowing oral administration, agomelatine is rapidly metabolised mainly via hepatic CYP1A2; \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes are also involved but with a low contribution. \nThe major metabolites, hydroxylated and demethylated agomelatine, are not active and are rapidly \nconjugated and eliminated in the urine. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination is rapid, the mean plasma half-life is between 1 and 2 hours and the clearance is high \n(about 1,100 ml/min) and essentially metabolic. \nExcretion is mainly (80%) urinary and in the form of metabolites, whereas unchanged compound \nrecovery in urine is negligible. \nKinetics are not modified after repeated administration. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo relevant modification of pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal impairment has \nbeen observed (n=8, single dose of 25 mg), but caution should be exercised in patients with severe or \nmoderate renal impairment as only limited clinical data are available in these patients (see section 4.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn a specific study involving cirrhotic patients with chronic mild (Child-Pugh type A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh type B) liver impairment, exposure to agomelatine 25 mg was substantially increased (70-\ntimes and 140-times, respectively), compared to matched volunteers (age, weight and smoking habit) \nwith no liver failure (see section 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nElderly \n \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in elderly patients (≥ 65 years), it was showed that at a dose of 25 mg the \nmean AUC and mean Cmax were about 4-fold and 13-fold higher for patients ≥ 75 years old \ncompared to patients < 75 years old. The total number of patients receiving 50 mg was too low to draw \nany conclusions. No dose adaptation is required in elderly patients. \n \nEthnic groups \n \nThere is no data on the influence of race on agomelatine pharmacokinetics. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn mice, rats and monkeys sedative effects were observed after single and repeated administration at \nhigh doses. \nIn rodents, a marked induction of CYP2B and a moderate induction of CYP1A and CYP3A were seen \nfrom 125 mg/kg/day whereas in monkeys the induction was slight for CYP2B and CYP3A at \n375 mg/kg/day. No hepatotoxicity was observed in rodents and monkeys in the repeat dose toxicity \nstudies. \nAgomelatine passes into the placenta and foetuses of pregnant rats. \nReproduction studies in the rat and the rabbit showed no effect of agomelatine on fertility, \nembryofoetal development and pre- and post natal development. \nA battery of in vitro and in vivo standard genotoxicity assays concludes to no mutagenic or clastogenic \npotential of agomelatine. \n \nIn carcinogenicity studies agomelatine induced an increase in the incidence of liver tumours in the rat \nand the mouse, at a dose at least 110-fold higher than the therapeutic dose. Liver tumours are most \nlikely related to enzyme induction specific to rodents. The frequency of benign mammary \nfibroadenomas observed in the rat was increased with high exposures (60-fold the exposure at the \ntherapeutic dose) but remains in the range of that of controls. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nSafety pharmacology studies showed no effect of agomelatine on hERG (human Ether à-go-go \nRelated Gene) current or on dog Purkinje cells action potential. Agomelatine did not show \nproconvulsive properties at ip doses up to 128 mg/kg in mice and rats. \n \nNo effect of agomelatine on juvenile animals behavioural performances, visual and reproductive \nfunction were observed. There were mild non dose dependent decreases in body weight related to the \npharmacological properties and some minor effects on male reproductive tract without any impairment \non reproductive performances. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients  \n \nTablet core \n \nLactose monohydrate \nMaize starch \nPovidone (K30) \nSodium starch glycolate type A \nStearic acid  \nMagnesium stearate  \nSilica, colloidal anhydrous  \n \nFilm-coating \n\n \nHypromellose  \nYellow iron oxide (E172) \nGlycerol  \nMacrogol (6000) \nMagnesium stearate  \nTitanium dioxide (E171) \n \nPrinting ink containing shellac, propylene glycol and indigo carmine aluminium lake (E132). \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n3 years. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nAluminium/PVC blister packed in cardboard boxes. \nCalendar packs containing 14, 28, 56, 84 and 98 film-coated tablets. \nCalendar packs of 100 film-coated tablets for hospital use. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal \n \nNo special requirements for disposal. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n \n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nLes Laboratoires Servier \n50, rue Carnot \n92284 Suresnes cedex \nFrance \n \n \n8 MARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S) \n \nEU/1/08/499/002 \nEU/1/08/499/003 \nEU/1/08/499/005 \nEU/1/08/499/006 \nEU/1/08/499/007 \nEU/1/08/499/008 \n \n \n9 DATE OF THE FIRST AUTHORISATION / RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION \n \nDate of first authorisation : 19 February 2009 \nDate of latest renewal : 12 December 2018 \n \n \n10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \nMM/YYYY \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu/.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \n\nA.

What Valdoxan is and what it is used for \n \nValdoxan contains the active ingredient agomelatine. It belongs to a group of medicines called \nantidepressants. You have been given Valdoxan to treat your depression. \nValdoxan is used in adults. \n \nDepression is a continuing disturbance of mood that interferes with everyday life. The symptoms of \ndepression vary from one person to another, but often include deep sadness, feelings of worthlessness, loss \nof interest in favourite activities, sleep disturbances, feeling of being slowed down, feelings of anxiety, \nchanges in weight. \nThe expected benefits of Valdoxan are to reduce and gradually remove the symptoms related to your \ndepression. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Valdoxan \n \nDo not take Valdoxan \n- if you are allergic to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).  \n- if your liver does not work properly (hepatic impairment). \n- if you are taking fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression) or \n\nciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nThere could be some reasons why Valdoxan may not be suitable for you:  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n- If you are taking medicines known to affect the liver. Ask your doctor for advice on which medicine \nthat is. \n\n- If you are obese or overweight, ask your doctor for advice. \n- If you are diabetic, ask your doctor for advice. \n- If you have increased levels of liver enzymes before treatment, your doctor will decide if Valdoxan \n\nis right for you. \n- If you have bipolar disorder, have experienced or if you develop manic symptoms (a period of \n\nabnormally high excitability and emotions) talk to your doctor before you start taking this medicine \nor before you continue with this medicine (see also under “Possible side effects” in section 4). \n\n- If you are suffering from dementia, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is \nright for you to take Valdoxan. \n \n\nDuring your treatment with Valdoxan : \n \nWhat to do to avoid potential serious liver problems \n- Your doctor should have checked that your liver is working properly before starting the \n\ntreatment. Some patients may get increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment \nwith Valdoxan.  Therefore follow-up tests should take place at the following time points:  \n \n\n before initiation \nor \n\ndose increase \n\naround \n3 weeks \n\naround \n6 weeks \n\naround \n12 weeks \n\naround \n24 weeks \n\nBlood tests      \n \n\nBased on the evaluation of these tests your doctor will decide whether you should receive or \ncontinue using Valdoxan (see also under “How to take Valdoxan” in section 3). \n\n \n \n\nBe vigilant about signs and symptoms that your liver may not be working properly \n- If you observe any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: unusual darkening of the \n\nurine, light coloured stools, yellow skin/eyes, pain in the upper right belly, unusual fatigue \n(especially associated with other symptoms listed above), seek urgent advice from a doctor \nwho may advise you to stop taking Valdoxan. \n\n \nEffect of Valdoxan is not documented in patients aged 75 years and older. Valdoxan should therefore not \nbe used in these patients. \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression \nIf you are depressed you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. These may be \nincreased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about \ntwo weeks but sometimes longer. \n \nYou may be more likely to think like this: \n- if you have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself. \n- if you are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal \nbehaviour in young adults (aged less than 25 years) with psychiatric conditions who were being treated \nwith an antidepressant.  \nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital \nstraight away.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nYou may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed and ask them to read this \nleaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression is getting worse, or if they are \nworried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nValdoxan should not be used in children and adolescents (under 18 years old).  \n \nOther medicines and Valdoxan \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou should not take Valdoxan together with certain medicines (see also under “Do not take Valdoxan” in \nsection 2): fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression), ciprofloxacin (an \nantibiotic) can modify the expected dose of agomelatine in your blood. \nMake sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: propranolol (a beta-blocker \nused in the treatment of hypertension), enoxacin (antibiotic)  \n \nMake sure to tell your doctor if you are smoking more than15 cigarettes/day. \n \nValdoxan with alcohol \nIt is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are being treated with Valdoxan. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nBreastfeeding should be discontinued if you take Valdoxan.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou might experience dizziness or sleepiness which could affect your ability to drive or operate machines. \nMake sure that your reactions are normal before driving or operating machines. \n \nValdoxan contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nValdoxan contains sodium \nValdoxan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Valdoxan \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Valdoxan is one tablet (25 mg) at bedtime. In some cases, your doctor may \nprescribe a higher dose (50 mg), i.e. two tablets to be taken together at bedtime.  \n \nMethod of administration \nValdoxan is for oral use. You should swallow your tablet with a drink of water. Valdoxan can be taken \nwith or without food. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nDuration of treatment \nValdoxan starts to act on symptoms of depression in most depressed people within two weeks of starting \ntreatment. \nYour depression should be treated for a sufficient period of at least 6 months to ensure that you are free of \nsymptoms. \nYour doctor may continue to give you Valdoxan when you are feeling better to prevent your depression \nfrom returning. \n \nIf you have trouble with your kidneys, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is safe \nfor you to take Valdoxan. \n \nSurveillance of the liver function (see also section 2): \nYour doctor will run laboratory tests to check that your liver is working properly before starting treatment \nand then periodically during treatment, usually after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.  \nIf your doctor increase the dose to 50mg, laboratory tests should be performed at this initiation and then \nperiodically during treatment, usually after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Thereafter tests \nwill be taken if the doctor finds it necessary. \nYou must not use Valdoxan if your liver does not work properly.  \n \nHow to switch from an antidepressant medicine (SSRI/SNRI) to Valdoxan? \nIf your doctor changes your previous antidepressant medicine from an SSRI or SNRI to Valdoxan, he/she \nwill advise you on how you should discontinue your previous medicine when starting Valdoxan. \nYou may experience discontinuation symptoms related to stopping of your previous medicine for a few \nweeks, even if the dose of your previous antidepressant medicine is decreased gradually.  \nDiscontinuation symptoms include: dizziness, numbness, sleep disturbances, agitation or anxiety, \nheadaches, feeling sick, being sick and shaking. These effects are usually mild to moderate and disappear \nspontaneously within a few days.  \nIf Valdoxan is initiated while tapering the dosage of the previous medicine, possible discontinuation \nsymptoms should not be confounded with a lack of early effect of Valdoxan. \nYou should discuss with your doctor on the best way of stopping your previous antidepressant medicine \nwhen starting Valdoxan. \n \nIf you take more Valdoxan than you should \nIf you have taken more Valdoxan than you should, or if for example a child has taken medicine by \naccident, contact your doctor immediately. \nThe experience of overdoses with Valdoxan is limited but reported symptoms include pain in the upper \npart of the stomach, somnolence, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, tension, dizziness, cyanosis or malaise. \n \nIf you forget to take Valdoxan \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just carry on with the next dose at the usual \ntime. \nThe calendar printed on the blister containing the tablets should help you remembering when you last took \na tablet of Valdoxan. \n \nIf you stop taking Valdoxan  \nDo not stop taking your medicine without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n4.
