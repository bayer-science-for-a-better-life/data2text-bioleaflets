This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSpinraza 12 mg solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach 5 ml vial contains nusinersen sodium equivalent to 12 mg nusinersen. \nEach ml contains 2.4 mg of nusinersen. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear and colourless solution with pH of approximately 7.2. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSpinraza is indicated for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Spinraza should only be initiated by a physician with experience in the management of \nspinal muscular atrophy (SMA). \n \nThe decision to treat should be based on an individualised expert evaluation of the expected benefits of \ntreatment for that individual, balanced against the potential risk of treatment with Spinraza. Patients \nwith profound hypotonia and respiratory failure at birth, where Spinraza has not been studied, may not \nexperience a clinically meaningful benefit due to severe SMN protein deficiency. \n \nPosology \n \nSpinraza is for intrathecal use by lumbar puncture. \n \nThe recommended dosage is 12 mg (5 ml) per administration. \nSpinraza treatment should be initiated as early as possible after diagnosis with 4 loading doses on \nDays 0, 14, 28 and 63. A maintenance dose should be administered once every 4 months thereafter. \n \nDuration of treatment \nInformation on long term efficacy of this medicinal product is not available. The need for continuation \nof therapy should be reviewed regularly and considered on an individual basis depending on the \npatient\u2019s clinical presentation and response to the therapy. \n \nMissed or delayed doses \nIf a loading dose is delayed or missed Spinraza should be administered as soon as possible, with at \nleast 14 days between doses, and continue dosing at the prescribed frequency. If a maintenance dose is \n\n\n\n3 \n\ndelayed or missed, Spinraza should be administered as soon as possible and dosing continued every 4 \nmonths. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nSpinraza has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The safety and efficacy in patients \nwith renal impairment has not been established and they should be closely observed. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSpinraza has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Spinraza is not metabolised via the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, therefore dose adjustment is unlikely to be required in \npatients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTreatment should be administered by health care professionals experienced in performing lumbar \npunctures. \n \nSpinraza is administered as an intrathecal bolus injection over 1 to 3 minutes, using a spinal \nanaesthesia needle. The injection must not be administered in areas of the skin where there are signs of \ninfection or inflammation. It is recommended that the volume of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), \nequivalent to the volume of Spinraza to be injected, is removed prior to administration of Spinraza. \n \nSedation may be required to administer Spinraza, as indicated by the clinical condition of the patient. \nUltrasound (or other imaging techniques) may be considered to guide intrathecal administration of \nSpinraza, particularly in younger patients and in patients with scoliosis. Aseptic technique should be \nused when preparing and administering Spinraza; see instructions for use in section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLumbar puncture procedure \n \nThere is a risk of adverse reactions occurring as part of the lumbar puncture procedure (e.g. headache, \nback pain, vomiting; see section 4.8). Potential difficulties with this route of administration may be \nseen in very young patients and those with scoliosis. The use of ultrasound or other imaging \ntechniques to assist with intrathecal administration of Spinraza, can be considered at the physician\u2019s \ndiscretion. \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have \nbeen observed after administration of other subcutaneously or intravenously administered antisense \noligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, platelet and coagulation laboratory testing is recommended \nprior to administration of Spinraza. \n \nRenal toxicity \n \nRenal toxicity has been observed after administration of other subcutaneously and intravenously \nadministered antisense oligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, urine protein testing (preferably using \na first morning urine specimen) is recommended. For persistent elevated urinary protein, further \nevaluation should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHydrocephalus \n \nThere have been reports of communicating hydrocephalus not related to meningitis or bleeding in \npatients treated with nusinersen in the post-marketing setting. Some patients were implanted with a \nventriculo-peritoneal shunt. In patients with decreased consciousness, an evaluation for hydrocephalus \nshould be considered. The benefits-and risks of nusinersen treatment in patients with a ventriculo-\nperitoneal shunt are unknown at present and the maintenance of treatment needs to be carefully \nconsidered. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. In vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer \nor inhibitor of CYP450 mediated metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that the likelihood for \ninteractions with nusinersen due to competition for plasma protein binding, or competition with or \ninhibition of transporters is low. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of nusinersen in pregnant women. Animal studies \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Spinraza during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether nusinersen/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nA risk to the newborn/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Spinraza therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nIn toxicity studies in animals no effects on male or female fertility were observed (see section 5.3). \nThere are no data available on the potential effects on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSpinraza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe safety assessment of Spinraza was based on two Phase 3 clinical studies in infants (CS3B) and \nchildren (CS4) with SMA, together with one Phase 2 study in infants and children with SMA (CS7) \nand open-label studies including pre-symptomatic infants (CS5) genetically diagnosed with SMA and \ninfants and children with SMA. Study CS11 enrolled infantile and later-onset patients including those \nwho had completed studies CS3B, CS4 and CS12. Of the 346 patients who received Spinraza up to a \nmaximum of 5 years, 258 patients received treatment for at least 1 year. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe assessment of undesirable effects is based on the following frequency data: \nVery common ( \u2265 1/10) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions related to lumbar puncture procedure reported in CS4 (later onset SMA) \nwith an incidence at least 5% higher in patients treated with Spinraza than sham-control \n \nMedDRA System Organ Class MedDRA preferred term Spinraza frequency category, n=84 \n\nNervous system disorders Headache* Very common \nGastrointestinal disorders Vomiting*  Very common \nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nBack pain* Very common \n\n*Adverse events considered related to the lumbar puncture procedure. These events can be considered manifestations of \npost-lumbar puncture syndrome. \n \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\nAdverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Spinraza. Among patients treated \nwith Spinraza by lumbar puncture, serious infection, such as meningitis, has been observed. \nCommunicating hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis and hypersensitivity (e.g. angioedema, urticaria \nand rash) have also been reported. The frequency of these reactions is not known as they have been \nreported from the post marketing setting. \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n\nAdverse reactions associated with the administration of Spinraza by lumbar puncture have been \nobserved. The majority of these are reported within 72 hours of the procedure. The incidence and \nseverity of these events were consistent with events expected to occur with lumbar puncture. No \nserious complications of lumbar puncture, such as serious infections, have been observed in the \nclinical trials of Spinraza. \n \nSome adverse events commonly associated with lumbar puncture (e.g. headache and back pain) could \nnot be assessed in the infant population exposed to Spinraza due to the limited communication \nappropriate for that age group. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe immunogenic response to nusinersen was determined in 346 patients with baseline and \npost-baseline plasma samples evaluated for anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Overall, the incidence of \nADAs was low, with 15 (4%) patients classified as ADA positive overall, of which 4 had a transient \nresponse, 5 had a persistent response, and 6 patients had responses which could not be classified as \ntransient or persistent at the time of data cut off. The impact of immunogenicity on safety was not \nformally analysed as the number of patients with ADAs was low. However, individual safety data for \nthe treatment-emergent ADA-positive cases were reviewed, and no AEs of interest were identified. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose associated with adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies. \n \nIn the event of an overdose, supportive medical care should be provided including consulting with a \nhealthcare professional and close observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: \nM09AX07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nNusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) which increases the proportion of exon 7 inclusion \nin survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts by binding to an \nintronic splice silencing site (ISS-N1) found in intron 7 of the SMN2 pre-messenger ribonucleic \nacid (pre-mRNA). By binding, the ASO displaces splicing factors, which normally suppress splicing. \nDisplacement of these factors leads to retention of exon 7 in the SMN2 mRNA and hence when SMN2 \nmRNA is produced, it can be translated into the functional full length SMN protein. \n \nSMA is a progressive neuromuscular disease resulting from mutations in chromosome 5q in the SMN1 \ngene. A second gene SMN2, located near SMN1, is responsible for a small amount of SMN protein \nproduction. SMA is a clinical spectrum of disease with disease severity linked to fewer numbers of \nSMN2 gene copies and younger age of symptom onset. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSymptomatic patients \n \nInfantile onset \nStudy CS3B (ENDEAR) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study \nconducted in 121 symptomatic infants \u2264 7 months of age, diagnosed with SMA (symptom onset before \n6 months of age). CS3B was designed to assess the effect of Spinraza on motor function and survival. \nPatients were randomized 2:1 to either Spinraza (as per the approved dosing regimen) or sham-control, \nwith a length of treatment ranging from 6 to 442 days. \n \nThe median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of SMA was 6.5 weeks and 8 weeks for \nSpinraza treated versus sham-control patients respectively, with 99% of patients having 2 copies of the \nSMN2 gene and therefore deemed most likely to develop Type I SMA. The median age when patients \nreceived their first dose was 164.5 days for treated patients, and 205 days for sham-control. Baseline \ndisease characteristics were largely similar in the Spinraza treated patients and sham-control patients \nexcept that Spinraza treated patients at baseline had a higher percentage compared to sham-control \npatients of paradoxical breathing (89% vs 66%), pneumonia or respiratory symptoms (35% vs 22%), \nswallowing or feeding difficulties (51% vs 29%) and requirement for respiratory support \n(26% vs 15%). \n \nAt the final analysis, a statistically significant greater percentage of patients achieved the definition of \na motor milestone responder in the Spinraza group (51%) compared to the sham-control \ngroup (0%) (p<0.0001). Time to death or permanent ventilation (\u2265 16 hours ventilation/day \ncontinuously for > 21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event or tracheostomy) was assessed \nas the primary endpoint. Statistically significant effects on event-free survival, overall survival, the \nproportion of patients achieving the definition of a motor milestone responder, and the percentage of \npatients with at least a 4-point improvement from baseline in Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia \nInfant Test for Neuromuscular Disease (CHOP INTEND) score were observed in patients in the \nSpinraza group compared to those in the sham-control group (Table 2). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn the efficacy set, 18 patients (25%) in the Spinraza group and 12 patients (32%) in the sham-control \ngroup required permanent ventilation. Of these patients, 6 (33%) in the Spinraza group and 0 (0%) in \nthe sham-control group met the protocol-defined criteria for a motor-milestone responder. \n \nTable 2: Primary and secondary endpoints at final analysis \u2013 Study CS3B \n\nEfficacy Parameter Spinraza treated Patients Sham-control Patients \n \n\nSurvival \nEvent-free survival2 \nNumber of patients who died or \nreceived permanent ventilation \nHazard ratio (95% CI) \np-value6 \n\n \n31 (39%) \n\n \n\n \n28 (68%)  \n\n0.53 (0.32 -0.89) \np = 0.0046 \n\nOverall survival2 \nNumber of patients who died \nHazard Ratio (95% CI) \np-value6 \n\n \n13 (16%) \n\n \n16 (39%) \n\n0.37 (0.18 \u2013 0.77) \np=0.0041 \n\nMotor function \nMotor milestones3 \nProportion achieving pre-defined \nmotor milestone responder criteria \n(HINE section 2)4,5 \n\nProportion at Day 183 \nProportion at Day 302 \nProportion at Day 394 \n\nProportion with improvement in total \nmotor milestone score \nProportion with worsening in total \nmotor milestone score \n\n \n37 (51%)1 \np<0.0001 \n\n \n41% \n45% \n54% \n\n49 (67%) \n \n\n1 (1%) \n\n \n0 (0%) \n\n \n \n\n5% \n0% \n0% \n\n5 (14%) \n \n\n8 (22%) \n\nCHOP INTEND3 \nProportion achieving a 4-point \nimprovement \nProportion achieving a 4-point \nworsening \nProportion with any improvement \nProportion with any worsening  \n\n \n52 (71%) \np<0.0001 \n\n2 (3%) \n \n\n53 (73%) \n5 (7%) \n\n \n1 (3%) \n\n \n17 (46%) \n\n \n1 (3%) \n\n18 (49%) \n1CS3B was stopped following positive statistical analysis on the primary endpoint at interim analysis (statistically \nsignificantly greater percentage of patients achieved the definition of a motor milestone responder in the Spinraza \ngroup (41%) compared to the sham-control group (0%), p<0.0001) \n2At the final analysis, event-free survival and overall survival were assessed using the Intent to Treat population (ITT \nSpinraza n=80; Sham-control n=41). \n3At the final analysis, CHOP INTEND and motor milestone analyses were conducted using the Efficacy Set (Spinraza n=73; \nSham-control n=37). \n4Assessed at the later of Day 183, Day 302, and Day 394 Study Visit \n5According to Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) section 2: \u22652 point increase [or maximal score] in \nability to kick, OR \u22651 point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing or walking, \nAND improvement in more categories of motor milestones than worsening, defined as a responder for this primary analysis. \n6Based on log-rank test stratified by disease duration \n \nThe extent of improvement in CHOP INTEND is shown in Figure 1 (change from baseline score for \neach subject). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFigure 1: Change in CHOP INTEND from Baseline to Later of Day 183, Day 302, and Day 394 Study \nVisit \u2013 Endear Study /CS3B (Efficacy Set, ES) \n\n \n \nTo allow for long term follow up of these patients, at the end of Study CS3B, 89 patients \n(Spinraza: n=65; sham-control: n=24) enrolled in Study CS11 (SHINE). Study CS11 is an open label \nextension study for SMA patients who previously participated in the other Spinraza clinical studies. In \nStudy CS11 all patients received Spinraza, with the length of treatment ranging from 65 to 592 days \n(median 289 days) at the time of interim analysis. Improvements in motor function were observed \namong patients continuing Spinraza from Study CS3B, as well as those who initiated Spinraza in \nStudy CS11 (Figure 3), with the greatest benefit observed in those with earlier treatment initiation. \nAmong patients without permanent ventilation at the baseline of Study CS11, a majority were alive \nand without permanent ventilation at the time of interim analysis. \n \nIn patients randomized to Spinraza in Study CS3B and including the experience in Study CS11, the \nmedian time to death or permanent ventilation was 73 weeks. At the time of a Study CS11 interim \nanalysis, 61 out of 65 patients (94%) were alive. Of the 45 patients who had not met the definition of \npermanent ventilation in Study CS3B, 38 patients (84%) were alive without permanent ventilation in \nStudy CS11 at the time of interim analysis. Further improvement in mean total motor milestone \n(HINE-Section 2) (2.1; SD 4.36; n=22) and CHOP INTEND (4.68; SD 3.993, n=22) scores were \nobserved from baseline to Study Day 304 in Study CS11. \n \nPatients who first initiated Spinraza treatment in Study CS11 (n=24; sham control in Study CS3B) \nwere of a median age of 17.8 months (range 10 - 23 months) and had a mean CHOP INTEND score of \n17.25 (range 2.0 - 46.0) at baseline in Study CS11. At the time of interim analysis, 22 out of 24 \npatients (92%) were alive. Of the twelve patients (50%) who had not met the definition of permanent \nventilation in Study CS3B, 7 patients (58%) were alive without permanent ventilation in Study CS11. \nThe median time to death or permanent ventilation was 50.9 weeks after initiation of Spinraza \ntreatment in Study CS11. Improvement in mean total motor milestone (HINE-Section 2) (1.2; SD 1.8; \nn=12) and CHOP INTEND (3.58; SD 7.051, n=12) scores were observed from baseline to Study Day \n304 in Study CS11. \n \nThese results are supported by an open-label Phase 2 study in symptomatic patients diagnosed with \nSMA (CS3A). Median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms was 56 days and patients had either \n2 SMN2 gene copies (n=17) or 3 SMN2 gene copies (n=2) (SMN2 gene copy number unknown for \n1 patient). Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type I SMA. The median age at \nfirst dose was 162 days. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved in one or more categories in motor \nmilestones (according to HINE section 2: \u22652 point increase [or maximal score] in ability to kick or \nvoluntary grasp OR \u22651 point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, \ncrawling, standing or walking). Twelve out of 20 patients (60%) in the study met the primary endpoint \nwith improvement in mean motor milestone achievement over time. An improvement in mean CHOP \nINTEND score over time was observed from baseline to day 1072 (mean change 21.30). Overall, 11 \nout of 20 patients (55%) met the endpoint of an increase in total CHOP INTEND score of \u22654 points as \nof the last study visit. Of the 20 subjects enrolled, 11 (55%) were alive and free of permanent \nventilation at the last visit. Four patients met the criteria for permanent ventilation and five patients \ndied during the study. \n \nLater onset \nStudy CS4 (CHERISH) was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study \nconducted in 126 symptomatic patients with later-onset SMA (symptom onset after 6 months of age). \nPatients were randomized 2:1 to either Spinraza (dosed with 3 loading doses and maintenance doses \nevery 6 months) or sham-control, with a length of treatment ranging from 324 to 482 days. The \nmedian age at screening was 3 years, and the median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of \nSMA was 11 months. The majority of patients (88%) have 3 copies of the SMN2 gene (8% have \n2 copies, 2% have 4 copies, and 2% have an unknown copy number). At baseline, patients had a mean \nHammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) score of 21.6, a mean revised upper limb \nmodule (RULM) of 19.1, all had achieved independent sitting, and no patients had achieved \nindependent walking. Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type II or III SMA. \nBaseline disease characteristics were generally similar with the exception of an imbalance in the \nproportion of patients who had ever achieved the ability to stand without support (13% of patients in \nthe Spinraza group and 29% in sham-control) or walk with support (24% of patients in the Spinraza \ngroup and 33% in sham-control). \n \nAt the final analysis, a statistically significant improvement in HFMSE score from baseline to \nMonth 15 was seen in the Spinraza group compared to the sham-control group (Table 3, Figure 2). \nThe analysis was conducted in the ITT population (Spinraza: n=84; sham-control: n=42), and \npost-baseline HFMSE data for patients without a Month 15 visit were imputed using the multiple \nimputation method. An analysis of the subset of patients in the ITT population who had observed \nvalues at Month 15 demonstrated consistent, statistically significant results. Of those with observed \nvalues at Month 15, a higher proportion of Spinraza treated subjects had improvement (73% vs 41%, \nrespectively) and a lower proportion of Spinraza treated subjects had worsening (23% vs 44%, \nrespectively) in total HFMSE score compared to sham-control. Secondary endpoints including \nfunctional measures and WHO motor milestone achievement were formally statistically tested and are \ndescribed in Table 3. \n \nInitiation of treatment sooner after symptom onset resulted in earlier and greater improvement in \nmotor function than those with delayed treatment initiation; however, both groups experienced benefit \ncompared to sham-control. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 3: Primary and secondary endpoints at final analysis \u2013 Study CS41 \n Spinraza treated Patients  Sham-control Patients \n\n \nHFMSE score \nChange from baseline in total \nHFMSE score at 15 months1,2,3 \n \nProportion of patients who achieved \nat least a 3 point improvement from \nbaseline to month 152 \n\n \n3.9 (95% CI: 3.0, 4.9) \n\np=0.0000001 \n \n\n56.8% (95% CI:45.6, 68.1) \nP=0.00065 \n\n \n-1.0 (95% CI: -2.5, 0.5) \n\n \n \n\n26.3% (95% CI: 12.4,40.2) \n\nRULM \nMean change from baseline to month \n15 in total RULM score2,3 \n\n \n4.2(95% CI: 3.4, 5.0) \n\np=0.00000016  \n\n \n0.5 (95% CI: -0.6, 1.6) \n\nWHO motor milestones \nProportion of patients who achieved \nnew motor milestones at 15 months4 \n\n \n19.7% (95% CI: 10.9, \n\n31.3) \np=0.0811 \n\n \n5.9% (95% CI: 0.7, \n\n19.7) \n \n\n1CS4 was stopped following positive statistical analysis on the primary endpoint at interim analysis (statistically significant \nimprovement from baseline HFMSE score was observed in Spinraza treated patients compared to the sham-control patients \n(Spinraza vs. sham-control: 4.0 vs. -1.9; p=0.0000002)) \n2 Assessed using the Intent to Treat population (Spinraza n=84; Sham-control n=42); data for patients without a Month 15 \nvisit were imputed using the multiple imputation method \n3Least squares mean \n4 Assessed using the Month 15 Efficacy Set (Spinraza n=66; Sham control n=34); analyses are based on \nimputed data when there are missing data. \n5 Based on logistic regression with treatment effect and adjustment for each subject's age at screening and HFMSE score at \nbaseline \n6Nominal p value \n \nFigure 2: Mean change from baseline in HFMSE score over time at final analysis (ITT) \u2013 \nStudy CS4 1,2 \n \n\n \n \nUpon completion of Study CS4 (CHERISH) 125 patients enrolled in Study CS11 (SHINE), where all \npatients received Spinraza.

A majority of Spinraza treated patients experienced stabilization or \nimprovement in motor function, with the greatest benefit observed in those with earlier treatment \ninitiation. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nOf patients who initiated Spinraza treatment in Study CS4 (n=39), stabilization or additional \nimprovements in mean HFMSE (0.2; SD 3.06) and RULM (0.7; SD 2.69) scores were observed from \nbaseline to Study Day 265 in Study CS11. \n \nPatients who initiated Spinraza treatment in Study CS11 (n=20) had a median age of 4.0 years (range 3 \n- 8 years). Of these patients, stabilization or improvement in mean HFMSE (1.4; SD 4.02) and RULM \n(2.1; SD 2.56) scores were observed from baseline to Study Day 265 in Study CS11. \n \nThese results are supported by 2 open label studies (study CS2 and study CS12). The analysis included \n28 patients who received their first dose in study CS2, and then transferred to the extension phase, \nstudy CS12. The studies enrolled patients who were between 2 to 15 years of age at first dose. Of the \n28 patients, 3 were at least 18 years of age at their last study visit. 1 out of 28 patients had 2 SMN2 \ngene copies, 21 had 3 copies, and 6 had 4 copies. \n \nPatients were assessed over a 3 year treatment period. A sustained improvement was seen in patients \nwith Type II SMA who experienced a mean improvement from baseline HFMSE score of 5.1 \n(SD 4.05, n=11) at Day 253, and 9.1(SD 6.61, n=9) at Day 1050. The mean total score was 26.4 \n(SD 11.91) at Day 253 and 31.3 (SD 13.02) at Day 1050, no plateau was observed. Patients with \nType III SMA demonstrated a mean improvement from baseline HFMSE score of 1.3 (SD 1.87, n=16) \nat Day 253 and 1.2 (SD 4.64, n=11) at Day 1050. The mean total score was 49.8 (SD 12.46) at \nDay 253 and 52.6 (SD 12.78) at 1050 days. \n \nIn patients with Type II SMA the Upper Limb Module test was conducted with mean improvement of \n1.9 (SD 2.68, n=11) at Day 253 and 3.5 (SD 3.32, n=9) at Day 1050. The mean total score was13.8 \n(SD 3.09) at Day 253 and 15.7 (SD 1.92) at Day 1050. \n \nThe 6MWT (six-minute walk test) was conducted for ambulatory patients only. In these patients, a \nmean improvement of 28.6 meters (SD 47.22, n=12) at Day 253 and 86.5 metres (SD 40.58, n=8) at \nDay 1050. The mean 6MWT distance was 278.5 meters (SD 206.46) at Day 253 and 333.6 metres \n(SD 176.47) at Day 1050. Two previously non-independent ambulatory patients (Type III) achieved \nindependent walking, and one non-ambulatory patient (Type II) achieved independent walking. \n \nAn additional clinical study, CS7 (EMBRACE) was opened for patients not eligible for participation \nin Study CS3B or Study CS4 due to screening age or SMN2 copy number. CS7 is a phase 2, \nrandomized, double-blind, sham-procedure study in symptomatic patients diagnosed with infantile-\nonset SMA (\u22646 months) or later-onset SMA (>6 months) and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 (Part 1), \nfollowed by a long-term open label extension phase (Part 2). In Part 1 of the study, patients were \nfollowed for a median of 302 days. \n \nAll patients who received Spinraza were alive as of the early termination of Part 1, however, one \npatient in the control arm died at Study Day 289. In addition, no patients in the Spinraza or sham-\ncontrol group required the use of permanent ventilation. Of the 13 patients with infantile-onset SMA, \n7 of out 9 patients (78%; 95%CI: 45, 94) in the Spinraza group and 0 out of 4 patients (0%; 95%CI: 0, \n60) in the sham group met the criteria for motor milestone response (according to HINE section 2: \u22652 \npoint increase [or maximal score] in ability to kick OR \u22651 point increase in the motor milestones of \nhead control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing or walking and improvement in more categories of \nmotor milestones than worsening). Of the 8 patients with later-onset SMA, 4 out of 5 patients (80%; \n95% CI: 38, 96) in the Spinraza group and 2 out of 3 (67%; 95% CI: 21, 94) in the sham-control group \nmet this definition of response. \n \nPre-symptomatic infants \n \nStudy CS5 (NURTURE) is an open-label study in pre-symptomatic infants genetically diagnosed with \nSMA, who were enrolled at 6 weeks of age or younger. Patients in this study were deemed most likely \nto develop Type I or II SMA. Median age at first dose was 22 days. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nAn interim analysis was conducted when patients had been on study for median of 27.1 months (15.1 -\n35.5 months) and were of a median age at last visit of 26.0 months (14.0 -34.3 months). At the interim \nanalysis, all 25 patients (2 SMN2 gene copies, n=15; 3 SMN2 gene copies, n=10) were alive without \npermanent ventilation. The primary endpoint, time to death or respiratory intervention (defined as \ninvasive or non-invasive ventilation for \u22656 hours/day continuously for \u22657 consecutive days OR \ntracheostomy), could not be estimated as there were too few events. Four patients (2 SMN2 copies) \nrequired respiratory intervention >6 hours/day continuously for \u22657 days, all of whom initiated \nventilatory support during an acute reversible illness \n \nPatients achieved milestones unexpected in Type I or II SMA and more consistent with normal \ndevelopment. At the interim analysis, all 25 (100%) patients had achieved the WHO motor milestone \nof sitting without support, 22 (88%) patients were walking with assistance. Among patients older than \nthe WHO defined window for expected age of achievement (95th percentile), 17 of 22 (77%) had \nachieved walking alone. The mean CHOP INTEND score at last assessment was 61.0 (46 - 64) \namongst patients with 2 SMN2 copies and 62.6 (58 - 64) amongst those with 3 SMN2 copies. All \npatients had the ability to suck and swallow at last assessment, with 22 (88%) infants achieving a \nmaximal score on the HINE Section 1. \n \nThe proportion of patients developing clinically manifested SMA was assessed amongst patients who \nreached the Day 700 visit at the interim analysis (n=16). The protocol-defined criteria for clinically \nmanifested SMA included age-adjusted weight below the fifth WHO percentile, a decrease of 2 or \nmore major weight growth curve percentiles, the placement of a percutaneous gastric tube, and/or the \ninability to achieve expected age-appropriate WHO milestones (sitting without support, standing with \nassistance, hands-and-knees crawling, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone). At \nday 700, 7 out of 11 patients (64%) with 2 SMN2 gene copies and 0 out of 5 patients (0%) with 3 \nSMN2 copies, met the protocol-defined criteria of clinically manifested SMA, however, these patients \nwere gaining weight and achieving WHO milestones, inconsistent with Type I SMA. A comparison of \nmotor milestone achievement among the patients with symptomatic infantile-onset SMA and \npre-symptomatic SMA is shown in Figure 3. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nFigure 3: Change in HINE Motor Milestones versus Study days for Study CS3B (treated and \nsham-control), CS3A, CS5 and CS11 \n \n\n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nusinersen, administered via intrathecal injection, \nwere determined in paediatric patients diagnosed with SMA. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIntrathecal injection of nusinersen into the CSF allows nusinersen to be fully available for distribution \nfrom the CSF to the target central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Mean CSF trough concentrations of \nnusinersen accumulated approximately 1.4- to 3-fold after multiple loading and maintenance doses, \nand reached a steady state within approximately 24 months. Following intrathecal administration \ntrough plasma concentrations of nusinersen were relatively low compared to the trough CSF \nconcentration. Median plasma Tmax values ranged from 1.7 to 6.0 hours. Mean plasma Cmax and AUC \nvalues increased approximately dose proportionally over the evaluated dose range. There is no \naccumulation in plasma exposure measures (Cmax and AUC) after multiple doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nAutopsy data from patients (n=3) show that nusinersen administered intrathecally is broadly \ndistributed within the CNS achieving therapeutic levels in the target spinal cord tissues. Presence of \nnusinersen was also demonstrated in neurons and other cell types in the spinal cord and brain, and \nperipheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNusinersen is metabolized slowly and predominantly via exonuclease (3\u2019- and 5\u2019) -mediated \nhydrolysis and is not a substrate for, or inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nElimination \n \nThe mean terminal elimination half-life in CSF is estimated at 135 to 177 days. The primary route of \nelimination is expected via urinary excretion of nusinersen and its metabolites. \n \nInteractions \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP450-mediated oxidative \nmetabolism and therefore should not interfere with other medicinal products for these metabolic \npathways. Nusinersen is not a substrate or inhibitor of human BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, \nOCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP transporters. \n \nCharacteristics in specific patient populations \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of nusinersen in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. \nThe effect of hepatic or renal insufficiency as covariates could not be thoroughly evaluated in the \npopulation PK model given the rarity of patients displaying clinically relevant liver or kidney \ninsufficiencies. Population PK analyses revealed no apparent correlation between hepatic and renal \nclinical chemistry markers and inter-subject variability. \n \nRace \nThe majority of patients studied were Caucasian. The population PK analysis suggests that race is \nunlikely to affect the PK of nusinersen. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenesis \n \nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of nusinersen have not been \nperformed. \n \nMutagenesis \n \nNusinersen demonstrated no evidence of genotoxicity. \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nReproductive toxicology studies were conducted using subcutaneous administration of nusinersen in \nmice and rabbits. No impact on male or female fertility, or embryo-foetal development, or \npre/post-natal development was observed. \n \nToxicology \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies (14-weeks and 53-weeks) of intrathecal administration to juvenile \ncynomolgus monkeys, nusinersen was well tolerated. The exception was an acute, transient deficit in \nlower spinal reflexes which occurred at the highest dose levels in each study (3 or 4 mg per dose; \nequivalent to 30 or 40 mg per intrathecal dose in patients). These effects were observed within several \nhours post-dose and generally resolved within 48 hours. \n \nIn the 53-week intrathecal dosing study in cynomolgus monkeys no toxicity effects were seen at levels \nup to 14-fold the recommended annual clinical maintenance dose. \n \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nSpinraza 12 mg solution for injection \n \n\nnusinersen \n \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child receives this medicine because it \ncontains important information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 If you or your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Spinraza is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Spinraza \n3. How Spinraza is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Spinraza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Spinraza is and what it is used for \n \nSpinraza contains the active substance nusinersen which belongs to a group of medicines known as \nantisense oligonucleotides. Spinraza is used to treat a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy \n(SMA). \n \nSpinal muscular atrophy is caused by a shortage of a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN) in \nthe body. This results in the loss of nerve cells in the spine, leading to weakness of the muscles in the \nshoulders, hips, thighs and upper back. It may also weaken the muscles used for breathing and \nswallowing. \n \nSpinraza works by helping the body to produce more of the SMN protein that people with SMA are \nlacking. This reduces the loss of nerve cells and so may improve muscle strength. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Spinraza \n \nSpinraza must not be given \n\u2022 If you or your child are allergic to nusinersen or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Spinraza. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nThere is a risk of side effects occuring after Spinraza is given by a lumbar puncture procedure (see \nsection 3). This can include headaches, vomiting and back pain. There may also be difficulties with \ngiving a medicine by this method in very young patients and those with scoliosis (twisted and curved \nspine). \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nOther products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the cells \nin the blood which help clotting. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide \nto do a blood test to check that your or your child\u2019s blood can clot properly. This may not be required \nevery time you or your child are given Spinraza. \n \nOther products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the \nkidneys. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide to do a urine test to \ncheck that your or your child\u2019s kidneys are working normally. This may not be required every time \nyou or your child are given Spinraza. \n \nThere have been a small number of reports of patients developing hydrocephalus (a build-up of too \nmuch fluid around the brain) after Spinraza is given. Some of these patients had needed to have a \ndevice called a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt implanted to treat the hydrocephalus. If you notice any \nsymptoms of increase in head size, decreased consciousness, persistent nausea, vomiting or headache; \nor other symptoms that cause you concern, please inform your or your child\u2019s doctor to seek necessary \ntreatment. The benefits and risks of continuing Spinraza whilst having a \"ventriculo-peritoneal shunt\" \nin place are not known at present. \n \nTalk to your doctor before you or your child are given Spinraza. \n \nOther medicines and Spinraza \nTell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken any, or might take any other \nmedicines in future. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before being given this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Spinraza \nduring pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSpinraza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nSpinraza contains a small amount of sodium \nEach dose of Spinraza contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium. It is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019 and \ncan be used by people on a sodium-restricted diet. \n \n \n3. How Spinraza is given \n \nThe usual dose of Spinraza is 12 mg. \n \nSpinraza is given; \n\u2022 On the first day of treatment, day 0 \n\u2022 Then around day 14, day 28 and day 63 \n\u2022 Then once every 4 months. \n \nSpinraza is given by injection into the lower back. This injection, called a lumbar puncture, is done by \ninserting a needle into the space around the spinal cord. This will be done by a doctor experienced in \ndoing lumbar punctures. You or your child may also be given a medicine to make you relax or sleep \nduring the procedure. \n \nHow long to use Spinraza \nYour doctor will tell you how long you or your child need to receive Spinraza. Don\u2019t stop treatment \nwith Spinraza unless your doctor tells you to. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nIf you or your child misses an injection \nIf you or your child miss a dose of Spinraza, speak with your doctor so that Spinraza can be given as \nsoon as possible. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Spinraza is given, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects related to the lumbar puncture may occur while Spinraza is being given or afterwards. The \nmajority of these side effects are reported within 72 hours of the procedure. \n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Back pain \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\n \nAdditional side effects not seen in clinical trials: \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Serious infection related to lumbar puncture (e.g. meningitis) \n\u2022 Hydrocephalus (a build-up of too much fluid around the brain) \n\u2022 Meningitis not caused by an infection (inflammation of the membrane around the spinal cord \n\nand brain, which may present as neck stiffness, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting) \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity (an allergic or allergic-like reaction that may include swelling of your face, \n\nlips or tongue, rash, or itching) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Spinraza \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after \u201cEXP\u201d.

known as antisense oligonucleotides. spinraza is used to treat a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy (sma). spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a shortage of a protein called survival motor neuron (smn) in the body. this results in the loss of nerve cells in the spine, leading to weakness of the muscles in the shoulders, hips, thighs and upper back. it may also weaken the muscles used for breathing and swallowing. spinraza works by helping the body to produce more of the smn protein that people with sma are lacking. this reduces the loss of nerve cells and so may improve muscle strength.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "spinraza", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 13, "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 8, "Score": 0.6804040670394897,

risk of side effects occuring after spinraza is given by a lumbar puncture procedure (see section 3). this can include headaches, vomiting and back pain. there may also be difficulties with giving a medicine by this method in very young patients and those with scoliosis (twisted and curved spine). other products that are in the same group of medicines as spinraza have been shown to affect the cells in the blood which help clotting. before you or your child are given spinraza your doctor may decide to do a blood test to check that your or your child's blood can clot properly. this may not be required every time you or your child are given spinraza. other products that are in the same group of medicines as spinraza have been shown to affect the kidneys. before you or your child are given spinraza your doctor may decide to do a urine test to check that your or your child's kidneys are working normally. this may not be required every time you or your child are given spinraza. there have been a small number of reports of patients developing hydrocephalus (a build-up of too much fluid around the brain) after spinraza is given. some of these patients had needed to have a device called a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt implanted to treat the hydrocephalus. if you notice any symptoms of increase in head size, decreased consciousness, persistent nausea, vomiting or headache; or other symptoms that cause you concern, please inform your or your child's doctor to seek necessary treatment. the benefits and risks of continuing spinraza whilst having a \"ventriculo-peritoneal shunt\" in place are not known at present. talk to your doctor before you or your child are given spinraza. other medicines and spinraza tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken any, or might take any other medicines in future. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. it is preferable to avoid the use of spinraza during pregnancy and breast-feeding. driving and using machines spinraza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. spinraza contains a small amount of sodium each dose of spinraza contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium. it is essentially 'sodium-free' and can be used by
