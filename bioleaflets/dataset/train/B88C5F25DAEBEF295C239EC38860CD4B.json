CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTAGRISSO as monotherapy is indicated for:\n\n\uf0b7 the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung \n\ncancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.\n\n\uf0b7 the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive \nNSCLC.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with TAGRISSO should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer \ntherapies. \n\nWhen considering the use of TAGRISSO, EGFR mutation status in tumour or plasma specimens \nshould be determined using a validated test method (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 80 mg osimertinib once a day until disease progression or unacceptable \ntoxicity.\n\nIf a dose of TAGRISSO is missed, the dose should be made up unless the next dose is due within 12 \nhours.\n\nTAGRISSO can be taken with or without food at the same time each day.\n\nDose adjustments\nDosing interruption and/or dose reduction may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. \nIf dose reduction is necessary, then the dose should be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily.\n\nDose reduction guidelines for adverse reactions toxicities are provided in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Recommended dose modifications for TAGRISSO \n\nTarget \norgan Adverse reactiona Dose modification\nPulmonary ILD/Pneumonitis Discontinue TAGRISSO (see Section 4.4)\nCardiac QTc interval greater than 500 msec \n\non at least 2 separate ECGs\nWithhold TAGRISSO until QTc interval is \nless than 481 msec or recovery to baseline if \nbaseline QTc is greater than or equal to 481 \nmsec, then restart at a reduced dose (40 mg)\n\nQTc interval prolongation with \nsigns/symptoms of serious \narrhythmia\n\nPermanently discontinue TAGRISSO\n\nOther Grade 3 or higher adverse reaction Withhold TAGRISSO for up to 3 weeks\nIf Grade 3 or higher adverse \nreaction improves to Grade 0-2 after \nwithholding of TAGRISSO for up \nto 3 weeks \n\nTAGRISSO may be restarted at the same dose \n(80 mg) or a lower dose (40 mg)\n\nGrade 3 or higher adverse reaction \nthat does not improve to Grade 0-2 \nafter withholding for up to 3 weeks \n\nPermanently discontinue TAGRISSO\n\na Note: The intensity of clinical adverse events graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.\n\nECGs: Electrocardiograms; QTc: QT interval corrected for heart rate\n\nSpecial populations\nNo dosage adjustment is required due to patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity and smoking \nstatus (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nBased on clinical studies, no dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment\n(Child Pugh A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B). Similarly, based on population \npharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic \n\n\n\n4\n\nimpairment (total bilirubin \u2264upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \n>ULN or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5x ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (total \nbilirubin between 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product \nhas not been established in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Until additional data become \navailable, use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nBased on clinical studies and population PK analysis, no dose adjustments are necessary in patients \nwith mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product \nhas not been established in patients with end-stage renal disease [creatinine clearance (CLcr) less than\n15 mL/min, calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault equation], or on dialysis. Caution should be \nexercised when treating patients with severe and end-stage renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of TAGRISSO in children or adolescents aged less than 18 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nThis medicinal product is for oral use. The tablet should be swallowed whole with water and it should \nnot be crushed, split or chewed.\n\nIf the patient is unable to swallow the tablet, the tablet may first be dispersed in 50 mL of \nnon-carbonated water. It should be dropped in the water, without crushing, stirred until dispersed and \nimmediately swallowed. An additional half a glass of water should be added to ensure that no residue \nremains and then immediately swallowed. No other liquids should be added.\n\nIf administration via nasogastric tube is required, the same process as above should be followed but \nusing volumes of 15 mL for the initial dispersion and 15 mL for the residue rinses. The resulting \n30 mL of liquid should be administered as per the naso-gastric tube manufacturer\u2019s instructions with \nappropriate water flushes. The dispersion and residues should be administered within 30 minutes of \nthe addition of the tablets to water.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nSt. John\u2019s Wort should not be used together with TAGRISSO (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAssessment of EGFR mutation status\nWhen considering the use of TAGRISSO as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, it \nis important that the EGFR mutation positive status is determined. A validated test should be \nperformed using either tumour DNA derived from a tissue sample or circulating tumour DNA \n(ctDNA) obtained from a plasma sample.\n\nOnly robust, reliable and sensitive tests with demonstrated utility for the determination of EGFR \nmutation status of tumour derived DNA (from a tissue or a plasma sample) should be used.\n\nPositive determination of EGFR mutation status using either a tissue-based or plasma-based test \nindicates eligibility for treatment with TAGRISSO. However, if a plasma-based ctDNA test is used \nand the result is negative, it is advisable to follow-up with a tissue test wherever possible due to the \npotential for false negative results using a plasma-based test.\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)\n\n\n\n5\n\nSevere, life-threatening or fatal Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g. \npneumonitis) have been observed in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical studies. Most cases \nimproved or resolved with interruption of treatment. Patients with a past medical history of ILD, \ndrug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically \nactive ILD were excluded from clinical studies (see section 4.8).\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g. pneumonitis) were reported in \n3.9% and were fatal in 0.4% of the 1142 patients who received TAGRISSO in FLAURA and AURA \nstudies. The incidence of ILD was 10.4% in patients of Japanese ethnicity, 1.8% in patients of Asian \nethnicity and 2.8% in non-Asian patients (see section 4.8).\n\nCareful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary \nsymptoms (dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Treatment with this \nmedicinal product should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD is \ndiagnosed, TAGRISSO should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary.\nReintroduction of TAGRISSO should be considered only after careful consideration of the individual \npatient\u2019s benefits and risk.\n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome\nCase reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported rarely in association with \nTAGRISSO treatment.  Before initiating treatment, patients should be advised of signs and symptoms \nof SJS.  If signs and symptoms suggestive of SJS appear, TAGRISSO should be interrupted or \ndiscontinued immediately.\n\nQTc interval prolongation\nQTc interval prolongation occurs in patients treated with TAGRISSO. QTc interval prolongation may \nlead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes) or sudden death. No \narrhythmic events were reported in FLAURA or AURA studies (see section 4.8). Patients with \nclinically important abnormalities in rhythm and conduction as measured by resting electrocardiogram \n(ECG) (e.g. QTc interval greater than 470 ms) were excluded from these studies (see section 4.8).\n\nWhen possible, the use of osimertinib in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be \navoided. Periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes should be considered \nin patients with congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medicinal \nproducts that are known to prolong the QTc interval. Treatment should be withheld in patients who \ndevelop a QTc interval greater than 500 msec on at least 2 separate ECGs until the QTc interval is less \nthan 481 msec or recovery to baseline if the QTc interval is greater than or equal to 481 msec, then \nresume TAGRISSO at a reduced dose as described in Table 1. Osimertinib should be permanently \ndiscontinued in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation in combination with any of the \nfollowing: Torsade de pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, signs/symptoms of serious \narrhythmia.\n\nChanges in cardiac contractility\nAcross clinical trials, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) decreases greater than or equal to \n10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 3.9% (35/908) of patients treated with TAGRISSO who \nhad baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. In patients with cardiac risk factors and \nthose with conditions that can affect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including an assessment of LVEF at \nbaseline and during treatment, should be considered. In patients who develop relevant cardiac \nsigns/symptoms during treatment, cardiac monitoring including LVEF assessment should be \nconsidered.\n\nKeratitis\nKeratitis was reported in 0.7% (n=8) of the 1142 patients treated with TAGRISSO in the FLAURA \nand AURA studies. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute \n\n\n\n6\n\nor worsening: eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye \nshould be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist (see section 4.2 Table 1).\n\nAge and body weight\nElderly patients (>65 years) or patients with low body weight (<50 kg) may be at increased risk of \ndeveloping adverse events of Grade 3 or higher. Close monitoring is recommended in these patients \n(see section 4.8).\n\nSodium\nThis medicine contains < 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 40 mg or 80 mg tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nStrong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the exposure of osimertinib. Osimertinib may increase the \nexposure of breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates.\n\nActive substances that may increase osimertinib plasma concentrations\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that the Phase I metabolism of osimertinib is predominantly via \nCYP3A4 and CYP3A5. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study in patients, co-administration with \n200 mg itraconazole twice daily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) had no clinically significant effect on \nthe exposure of osimertinib (area under the curve (AUC) increased by 24% and Cmax decreased by \n20%). Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors are not likely to affect the exposure of osimertinib. Further \ncatalyzing enzymes have not been identified.\n\nActive substances that may decrease osimertinib plasma concentrations\nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic study in patients, the steady-state AUC of osimertinib was reduced by \n78% when co-administered with rifampicin (600 mg daily for 21 days). Similarly, the exposure to \nmetabolite AZ5104 decreased by 82% for the AUC and 78% for Cmax. It is recommended that \nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. Phenytoin, rifampicin and carbamazepine) with \nTAGRISSO should be avoided. Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, \nmodafinil) may also decrease osimertinib exposure and should be used with caution, or avoided when \npossible. There are no clinical data available to recommend a dose adjustment of TAGRISSO. \nConcomitant use of St. John\u2019s Wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nEffect of gastric acid reducing active substances on osimertinib\nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic study, co-administration of omeprazole did not result in clinically \nrelevant changes in osimertinib exposures. Gastric pH modifying agents can be concomitantly used \nwith TAGRISSO without any restrictions.\n\nActive substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by TAGRISSO\nBased on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a competitive inhibitor of BCRP transporters.\n\nIn a clinical PK study, co-administration of TAGRISSO with rosuvastatin (sensitive BCRP substrate) \nincreased the AUC and Cmax of rosuvastatin by 35% and 72%, respectively. Patients taking \nconcomitant medications with disposition dependent upon BCRP and with narrow therapeutic index \nshould be closely monitored for signs of changed tolerability of the concomitant medication as a result \nof increased exposure whilst receiving TAGRISSO (see section 5.2).\n\nIn a clinical PK study, co-administration of TAGRISSO with simvastatin (sensitive CYP3A4 \nsubstrate) decreased the AUC and Cmax of simvastatin by 9% and 23% respectively. These changes are \nsmall and not likely to be of clinical significance. Clinical PK interactions with CYP3A4 substrates \nare unlikely. A risk for decreased exposure of hormonal contraceptives cannot be excluded.\n\n\n\n7\n\nIn a clinical Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) interaction study, co-administration of TAGRISSO with \nfexofenadine (P-gp substrate) increased the AUC and Cmax of fexofenadine by 56% (90% CI 35, 79) \nand 76% (90% CI 49, 108) after a single dose and 27% (90% CI 11, 46) and 25% (90% CI 6, 48) at \nsteady state, respectively. Patients taking concomitant medications with disposition dependent upon \nP-gp and with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran, aliskiren) should be closely \nmonitored for signs of changed tolerability as a result of increased exposure of the concomitant \nmedication whilst receiving TAGRISSO (see section 5.2). \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \nTAGRISSO. Patients should be advised to use effective contraception for the following periods after \ncompletion of treatment with this medicinal product: at least 2 months for females and 4 months for \nmales. A risk for decreased exposure of hormonal contraceptives cannot be excluded.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of osimertinib in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (embryolethality, reduced foetal growth, and neonatal \ndeath, see section 5.3). Based on its mechanism of action and preclinical data, osimertinib may cause \nfoetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. TAGRISSO should not be used during \npregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with osimertinib.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether osimertinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There is \ninsufficient information on the excretion of osimertinib or its metabolites in animal milk. However, \nosimertinib and its metabolites were detected in the suckling pups and there were adverse effects on \npup growth and survival (see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with TAGRISSO.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data on the effect of TAGRISSO on human fertility. Results from animal studies have \nshown that osimertinib has effects on male and female reproductive organs and could impair fertility \n(see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTAGRISSO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nStudies in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients\nThe data described below reflect exposure to TAGRISSO in 1142 patients with EGFR mutation-\npositive non-small cell lung cancer. These patients received TAGRISSO at a dose of 80 mg daily in \ntwo randomised Phase 3 studies (FLAURA, first line and AURA3, second line only), two single-arm \nstudies (AURAex and AURA2, second line or greater) and one Phase 1 study (AURA1, first-line or \ngreater) (see section 5.1). Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most commonly \nreported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were diarrhoea (49%) and rash (47%). Grade 3 and Grade 4 \nadverse reactions across both studies were 9.7% and 0.9%, respectively. In patients treated with \nTAGRISSO 80 mg once daily, dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.1% of the \npatients. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 4.3%.\n\n\n\n8\n\nPatients with a medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid \ntreatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD were excluded from clinical studies. Patients with \nclinically important abnormalities in rhythm and conduction as measured by resting electrocardiogram \n(ECG) (e.g. QTc interval greater than 470 ms) were excluded from these studies. Patients were \nevaluated for LVEF at screening and every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions have been assigned to the frequency categories in Table 2 where possible based on \nthe incidence of comparable adverse event reports in a pooled dataset from the 1142 EGFR mutation \npositive NSCLC patients who received TAGRISSO at a dose of 80 mg daily in the FLAURA, \nAURA3, AURAex, AURA 2 and AURA1 studies. \n\nAdverse reactions are listed according to system organ class (SOC) in MedDRA. Within each system \norgan class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on \nthe CIOMS III convention and is defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data). \n\nTable 2.

Post-marketing reports of \n\nerythema multiforme have also been received, including 7 reports from a post-marketing surveillance study (N=3578).\nk One event was reported in a post-marketing study, and the frequency has been derived from the FLAURA and AURA \n\nstudies and the post-marketing study (N=4720).\nl Represents the incidence of patients who had a QTcF prolongation >500msec.\nm Represents the incidence of laboratory findings, not of reported adverse events.\n\nSafety findings in the single-arm Phase 2 AURAex and AURA2 studies were generally consistent \nwith those observed in the AURA3 TAGRISSO arm. No additional or unexpected toxicity has been \nobserved and adverse events have been aligned in type, severity and frequency.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)\nIn the FLAURA and AURA studies, the incidence of ILD was 10.4% in patients of Japanese \nethnicity, 1.8% in patients of non-Japanese Asian ethnicity and 2.8% in non-Asian patients. The \nmedian time to onset of ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions was 85 days (see section 4.4).\n\nQTc interval prolongation\nOf the 1142 patients in FLAURA and AURA studies treated with TAGRISSO 80 mg, 0.9% of \npatients (n=10) were found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec, and 3.6% of patients (n=41) had an \nincrease from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis with \nTAGRISSO predicted a concentration-dependent increase in QTc interval prolongation. No QTc-\nrelated arrhythmias were reported in the FLAURA or AURA studies (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n10\n\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn the FLAURA and AURA studies, diarrhoea was reported in 49% of patients of which 39% were \nGrade 1 events, 8.0% Grade 2 and 1.2% were Grade 3; no Grade 4 or 5 events were reported. Dose \nreduction was required in 0.2% of patients and dose interruption in 1.4%. One event (0.1%) led to \ndiscontinuation. In FLAURA and AURA3 the median time to onset was 19 days and 22 days, \nrespectively, and the median duration of the Grade 2 events was 19 days and 6 days, respectively.\n\nHaematological events\nEarly reductions in the median laboratory counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets \nhave been observed in patients treated with TAGRISSO, which stabilised over time and then\nremained above the lower limit of normal. Adverse events of leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia \nand thrombocytopenia have been reported, most of which were mild or moderate in severity and did \nnot lead to dose interruptions.\n\nElderly\nIn FLAURA and AURA3 (N=1142), 43% of patients were 65 years of age and older, and 13% were \n75 years of age and older. Compared with younger subjects (<65), more subjects \u226565 years old had \nreported adverse reactions that led to study drug dose modifications (interruptions or reductions) \n(13.4% versus 7.6%). The types of adverse events reported were similar regardless of age. Older \npatients reported more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions compared to younger patients (13.4% \nversus 9.3%). No overall differences in efficacy were observed between these subjects and younger \nsubjects. A consistent pattern in safety and efficacy results was observed in the analysis of AURA \nPhase 2 studies.\n\nLow body weight\nPatients receiving TAGRISSO 80 mg with low body weight (<50 kg) reported higher frequencies of \nGrade \u22653 adverse events (52% versus 35%) and QTc prolongation (14% versus 4%) than patients \nwith higher body weight (\u226550 kg).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn TAGRISSO clinical trials a limited number of patients were treated with daily doses of up to \n240 mg without dose limiting toxicities. In these studies, patients who were treated with TAGRISSO \ndaily doses of 160 mg and 240 mg experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of a number \nof typical EGFR TKI-induced AEs (primarily diarrhoea and skin rash) compared to the 80 mg dose. \nThere is limited experience with accidental overdoses in humans. All cases were isolated incidents of \npatients taking an additional daily dose of TAGRISSO in error, without any resulting clinical \nconsequences.\n\nThere is no specific treatment in the event of TAGRISSO overdose. In case of suspected overdose, \nTAGRISSO should be withheld and symptomatic treatment initiated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01XE35.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nMechanism of action\nOsimertinib is a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). It is an irreversible inhibitor of Epidermal Growth \nFactor Receptors (EGFRs) harboring sensitising-mutations (EGFRm) and TKI-resistance mutation \nT790M.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that osimertinib has high potency and inhibitory activity against \nEGFR across a range of all clinically relevant EGFR sensitising-mutant and T790M mutant non-small \ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (apparent IC50s from 6 nM to 54 nM against phospho-EGFR). \nThis leads to inhibition of cell growth, while showing significantly less activity against EGFR in \nwild-type cell lines (apparent IC50s from 480 nM to 1.8 \u03bcM against phospho-EGFR). In vivo oral \nadministration of osimertinib lead to tumour shrinkage in both EGFRm and T790M NSCLC xenograft \nand transgenic mouse lung tumour models.\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\nThe QTc interval prolongation potential of TAGRISSO was assessed in 210 patients who received \nosimertinib 80 mg daily in AURA2. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at \nsteady-state to evaluate the effect of osimertinib on QTc intervals. A \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis predicted a drug-related QTc interval prolongation at \n80 mg of 14 msec with an upper bound of 16 msec (90% CI).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nPreviously untreated EGFR mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC \u2013 FLAURA\nThe efficacy and safety of TAGRISSO for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation positive \nlocally advanced, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, or metastatic NSCLC, who had \nnot received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease, was demonstrated in a randomised, \ndouble-blind, active-controlled study (FLAURA). Patient tumour tissue samples were required to \nhave one of the two common EGFR mutations known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity \n(Ex19del or L858R), as identified by local or central testing. \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1 to receive either TAGRISSO (n=279, 80 mg orally once daily) or EGFR \nTKI comparator (n=277; gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily or erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily). \nRandomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation type (Ex19del or L858R) and ethnicity (Asian or \nnon-Asian). Patients received study therapy until intolerance to therapy, or the investigator \ndetermined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. For patients receiving EGFR \nTKI comparator, post-progression crossover to open-label TAGRISSO was permitted provided \ntumour samples tested positive for the T790M mutation. The primary efficacy end-point was \nprogression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator.\n\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall study population were: median \nage 64 years (range 26-93 years), \u226575 years old (14%), female (63%), White (36%), Asian (62%), \nnever smokers (64%), World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 (100%), \nmetastatic bone disease (36%), extra-thoracic visceral metastases (35%), CNS metastases (21%, \nidentified by CNS lesion site at baseline, medical history, and/or prior surgery, and/or prior \nradiotherapy to CNS metastases).\n\nTAGRISSO demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS \ncompared to EGFR TKI comparator (median 18.9 months and 10.2 months, respectively, HR=0.46, \n95% CI: 0.37, 0.57; P<0.0001). Efficacy results from FLAURA by investigator assessment are \nsummarised in Table 3, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 1. The final analysis \nof overall survival (OS, 58% maturity) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with an\nHR of 0.799 (95.05% CI: 0.641, 0.997) and a clinically meaningful longer median survival time in \n\n\n\n12\n\npatients randomized to TAGRISSO compared to EGFR TKI comparator (Table 3 and Figure 2). A \ngreater proportion of patients treated with TAGRISSO were alive at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months (89%, \n81%, 74% and 54% respectively) compared to patients treated with EGFR TKI comparator (83%, \n71%, 59% and 44% respectively). Analysis of post-progression end\u2013points demonstrated that the PFS \nbenefit was preserved through subsequent lines of therapy.\n\nTable 3.

Irrespective of CNS lesion status at study \nentry, patients in the TAGRISSO arm demonstrated an efficacy benefit over those in the EGFR TKI \ncomparator arm and there were fewer patients with new CNS lesions in the TAGRISSO arm \ncompared to the EGFR TKI comparator arm (TAGRISSO, 11/279 [3.9%] compared to EGFR TKI \ncomparator, 34/277 [12.3%]). In the subset of patients without CNS lesions at baseline, there were a \nlower number of new CNS lesions in the TAGRISSO arm compared to the EGFR TKI comparator \narm (7/226 [3.1%] vs. 15/214 [7.0%], respectively).\n\nFigure 3. Overall PFS by investigator assessment by CNS metastases status at study entry, \nKaplan-Meier plot (full analysis set) in FLAURA \n\nPatient Reported Outcomes (PRO)\n\nPatient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were electronically collected \nusing the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The LC13 was \ninitially administered once a week for the first 6 weeks, then every 3 weeks before and after \nprogression. The C30 was assessed every 6 weeks before and after progression. At baseline, no \ndifferences in patient reported symptoms, function or HRQL were observed between TAGRISSO and \nEGFR TKI comparator (gefitinib or erlotinib) arms. Compliance over the first 9 months was generally\nhigh (\u226570%) and similar in both arms.\n\n\n\n17\n\nKey lung cancer symptoms analysis\nData collected from baseline up to month 9 showed similar improvements in TAGRISSO and EGFR \nTKI comparator groups for the five pre-specified primary PRO symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, chest \npain, fatigue, and appetite loss) with improvement in cough reaching the established clinically \nrelevant cutoff. Up to month 9 there were no clinically meaningful differences in patient-reported \nsymptoms between TAGRISSO and EGFR TKI comparator groups (as assessed by a difference of \n\u2265 10 points).\n\nHRQL and physical functioning improvement analysis\nBoth groups reported similar improvements in most functioning domains and global health \nstatus/HRQL, indicating that patients\u2019 overall health status improved. Up to month 9, there were no \nclinically meaningful differences between the TAGRISSO and EGFR TKI comparator groups in \nfunctioning or HRQL. \n\nPre-treated T790M positive NSCLC patients-AURA3\nThe efficacy and safety of TAGRISSO for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic T790M NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy, was \ndemonstrated in a randomised, open-label, active-controlled Phase 3 study (AURA3). All patients \nwere required to have EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the cobas EGFR \nmutation test performed in a central laboratory prior to randomisation. The T790M mutation status \nwas also assessed using ctDNA extracted from a plasma sample taken during screening. The primary \nefficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator. Additional efficacy \noutcome measures included ORR, DoR and overall survival (OS) as assessed by investigator.\n\nPatients were randomised in a 2:1 (TAGRISSO: platinum-based doublet chemotherapy) ratio to \nreceive TAGRISSO (n=279) or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n=140). Randomisation was \nstratified by ethnicity (Asian and non-Asian). Patients in the TAGRISSO arm received TAGRISSO \n80 mg orally once daily until intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient \nwas no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Chemotherapy consisted of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with \ncarboplatin AUC5 or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle \nfor up to 6 cycles. Patients whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based \nchemotherapy may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of \nevery 21-day cycle). Subjects on the chemotherapy arm who had objective radiological progression \n(by the investigator and confirmed by independent central imaging review) were given the \nopportunity to begin treatment with TAGRISSO.\n\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall study population were: median \nage 62, \u226575 years old (15%), female (64%), white (32%), Asian (65%), never smoker (68%), WHO \nperformance status 0 or 1 (100%). Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients had extra-thoracic visceral \nmetastases, including 34% with CNS metastases (identified by CNS lesion site at baseline, medical \nhistory, and/or prior surgery, and/or prior radiotherapy to CNS metastases) and 23% with liver \nmetastases. Forty-two percent (42%) of patients had metastatic bone disease.\n\nAURA3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the patients treated with \nTAGRISSO compared to chemotherapy. Efficacy results from AURA3 by investigator assessment are \nsummarised in Table 5, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 4. No statistically \nsignificant difference was observed between the treatment arms at the final OS analysis.\n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 5.

All patients were \nrequired to have EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the cobas EGFR mutation test \nperformed in a central laboratory prior to treatment. The T790M mutation status was also assessed \nretrospectively using ctDNA extracted from a plasma sample taken during screening. All patients \nreceived TAGRISSO at a dose of 80 mg once daily. The primary efficacy outcome measure of these \ntwo trials was ORR according to RECIST v1.1 as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Central Review \n(BICR). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included Duration of Response (DoR) and \nProgression-Free Survival (PFS).\n\nBaseline characteristics of the overall study population (AURAex and AURA2) were as follows: \nmedian age 63 years, 13% of patients were \u226575 years old, female (68%), White (36%), Asian (60%). \nAll patients received at least one prior line of therapy. Thirty-one percent (31%) (N=129) had \nreceived 1 prior line of therapy (EGFR-TKI treatment only), 69% (N=282) had received 2 or more \nprior lines. Seventy-two percent (72%) of patients were never smokers, 100% of patients had a World \nHealth Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of patients had \nextra-thoracic visceral metastasis including 39% with CNS metastases (identified by CNS lesion site \nat baseline, medical history, and/or prior surgery and/or prior radiotherapy to CNS metastases) and \n29% with liver metastases. Forty-seven percent (47%) of patients had metastatic bone disease. The \nmedian duration of follow up for PFS was 12.6 months.\n\nIn the 411 pre-treated EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients, the total ORR by Blinded \nIndependent Central Review (BICR) was 66% (95% CI: 61, 71). In patients with a confirmed \nresponse by BICR, the median DoR was 12.5 months (95% CI: 11.1, NE). The ORR by BICR in \nAURAex was 62% (95% CI: 55, 68) and 70% (95% CI: 63, 77) in AURA2. The median PFS was \n11.0 months 95% CI (9.6, 12.4).\n\nObjective response rates by BICR above 50% were observed in all predefined subgroups analysed, \nincluding line of therapy, ethnicity, age and region.\n\nIn the evaluable for response population, 85% (223/262) had documentation of response at the time of \nthe first scan (6 weeks); 94% (247/262) had documentation of response at the time of the second scan \n(12 weeks).\n\nCNS metastases efficacy data in Phase 2 studies (AURAex and AURA2)\nA BICR assessment of CNS efficacy by RECIST v 1.1 was performed in a subgroup of 50 (out of \n411) patients identified to have measurable CNS metastases on a baseline brain scan. A CNS ORR of \n54% (27/50 patients; 95% CI: 39.3, 68.2) was observed with 12% of these responses being complete \nresponses.\n\nClinical studies have not been conducted in patients with de novo EGFR T790M mutation-positive \nNSCLC.\n\n\n\n23\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTAGRISSO in all subsets of the paediatric population in NSCLC (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nOsimertinib pharmacokinetic parameters have been characterised in healthy subjects and NSCLC \npatients. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, osimertinib apparent plasma clearance is \n14.3 L/h, apparent volume of distribution is 918 L and terminal half-life of approximately 44 hours. \nThe AUC and Cmax increased dose proportionally over 20 to 240 mg dose range. Administration of \nosimertinib once daily results in approximately 3 fold accumulation with steady-state exposures \nachieved by 15 days of dosing. At steady-state, circulating plasma concentrations are typically \nmaintained within a 1.6 fold range over the 24-hour dosing interval.\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of TAGRISSO, peak plasma concentrations of osimertinib were \nachieved with a median (min-max) tmax of 6 (3-24) hours, with several peaks observed over the first 24 \nhours in some patients. The absolute bioavailability of TAGRISSO is 70% (90% CI 67, 73). Based on \na clinical pharmacokinetic study in patients at 80 mg, food does not alter osimertinib bioavailability to \na clinically meaningful extent. (AUC increase by 6% (90% CI -5, 19) and Cmax decrease by 7% (90% \nCI -19, 6)). In healthy volunteers administered an 80 mg tablet where gastric pH was elevated by \ndosing of omeprazole for 5 days, osimertinib exposure was not affected (AUC and Cmax increase by \n7% and 2%, respectively) with the 90% CI for exposure ratio contained within the 80-125% limit.\n\nDistribution\nPopulation estimated mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) of osimertinib is 918 L \nindicating extensive distribution into tissue. In vitro plasma protein binding of osimertinib is 94.7% \n(5.3% free). Osimertinib has also been demonstrated to bind covalently to rat and human plasma \nproteins, human serum albumin and rat and human hepatocytes.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro studies indicate that osimertinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. \nHowever, with current available data, alternative metabolic pathways cannot be fully ruled out. Based \non in vitro studies, 2 pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) have subsequently \nbeen identified in the plasma of preclinical species and in humans after oral dosing with osimertinib; \nAZ7550 showed a similar pharmacological profile to TAGRISSO while AZ5104 showed greater \npotency across both mutant and wild-type EGFR. Both metabolites appeared slowly in plasma after \nadministration of TAGRISSO to patients, with a median (min-max) tmax of 24 (4-72) and 24 (6-72) \nhours, respectively. In human plasma, parent osimertinib accounted for 0.8%, with the 2 metabolites \ncontributing 0.08% and 0.07% of the total radioactivity with the majority of the radioactivity being \ncovalently bound to plasma proteins. The geometric mean exposure of both AZ5104 and AZ7550, \nbased on AUC, was approximately 10% each of the exposure of osimertinib at steady-state. \n\nThe main metabolic pathway of osimertinib was oxidation and dealkylation. At least 12 components \nwere observed in the pooled urine and faecal samples in humans with 5 components accounting for \n>1% of the dose of which unchanged osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550, accounted for approximately \n1.9, 6.6 and 2.7% of the dose while a cysteinyl adduct (M21) and an unknown metabolite (M25) \naccounted for 1.5% and 1.9% of the dose, respectively.\n\nBased on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP 3A4/5 but not CYP1A2, 2A6, \n2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Based on in vitro studies, \nosimertinib is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations \nhepatically. Intestinal inhibition of UGT1A1 is possible but the clinical impact is unknown.\n\n\n\n24\n\nElimination\nFollowing a single oral dose of 20 mg, 67.8% of the dose was recovered in faeces (1.2% as parent) \nwhile 14.2% of the administered dose (0.8% as parent) was found in urine by 84 days of sample \ncollection. Unchanged osimertinib accounted for approximately 2% of the elimination with 0.8% in \nurine and 1.2% in faeces.\n\nInteractions with transport proteins\nIn vitro studies have shown that osimertinib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In vitro, \nosimertinib does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, OCT2 and MATE2K at \nclinically relevant concentrations. \n\nEffects of osimertinib on P-gp and BCRP\nBased on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but is unlikely to result in \nclinically relevant drug interactions with active substances by osimertinib at the clinical doses. Based \non in vitro data, osimertinib is an inhibitor of BCRP and P-gp (see section 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\nIn a population based pharmacokinetic analyses (n=1367), no clinically significant relationships were \nidentified between predicted steady-state exposure (AUCss) and patient\u2019s age (range: 25 to 91 years), \ngender (65% female), ethnicity (including White, Asian, Japanese, Chinese and non-Asian-non-White \npatients), line of therapy and smoking status (n=34 current smokers, n=419 former smokers). \nPopulation PK analysis indicated that body weight was a significant covariate with a less than 20% \nchange in osimertinib AUCss expected across a body weight range of 88 kg to 43 kg respectively \n(95% to 5% quantiles) when compared to the AUCss for the median body weight of 61 kg. Taking the \nextremes of body weight into consideration, from <43 kg to >88 kg, AZ5104 metabolite ratios ranged \nfrom 11.8% to 9.6% while for AZ7550 it ranged from 12.8% to 8.1%, respectively. Based on \npopulation PK analysis, serum albumin was identified as a significant covariate with a <30% change \nin osimertinib AUCss expected across the albumin range of 29 to 46 g/L respectively (95% to 5% \nquantiles) when compared to the AUCss for the median baseline albumin of 39 g/L. These exposure \nchanges due to body weight or baseline albumin differences are not considered clinically relevant. \n\nHepatic impairment\nOsimertinib is eliminated mainly via the liver. In a clinical trial, patients with different types of \nadvanced solid tumours and with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A, mean score = 5.3, n=7) or \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B, mean score = 8.2, n=5) had no increase in exposure \ncompared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=10) after a single 80 mg dose of TAGRISSO.\nThe geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of osimertinib AUC and Cmax was 63.3% (47.3, 84.5) and 51.4% \n(36.6, 72.3) in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 68.4% (49.6, 94.2) and 60.7% (41.6, 88.6) \nin patients with moderate hepatic impairment; for the metabolite AZ5104 the AUC and Cmax were\n66.5% (43.4, 101.9) and 66.3% (45.3, 96.9) in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 50.9% \n(31.7, 81.6) and 44.0% (28.9, 67.1) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, compared to the \nexposure in patients with normal hepatic function. Based on population PK analysis, there was no \nrelationship between markers of hepatic function (ALT, AST, bilirubin) and osimertinib exposure. \nThe hepatic impairment marker serum albumin showed an effect on the PK of osimertinib. Clinical \nstudies that were conducted excluded patients with AST or ALT >2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), \nor if due to underlying malignancy, >5.0x ULN or with total bilirubin >1.5x ULN. Based on a \npharmacokinetic analysis of 134 patients with mild hepatic impairment, 8 patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment and 1216 patients with normal hepatic function osimertinib exposures were \nsimilar. There are no data available on patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nIn a clinical trial, patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to less than 30 mL/min; n=7) \ncompared to patients with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 90 mL/min; n=8) after \na single 80 mg oral dose of TAGRISSO showed a 1.85-fold increase in AUC (90% CI; 0.94, 3.64) \n\n\n\n25\n\nand a 1.19-fold increase in Cmax (90% CI: 0.69, 2.07). Furthermore, based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of 593 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to less than \n90 mL/min), 254 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to less than 60 mL/min), 5\npatients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to less than 30 mL/min) and 502 patients with normal \nrenal function (greater than or equal to 90 mL/min), osimertinib exposures were similar. Patients with \nCLcr less than or equal to 10 mL/min were not included in the clinical trials.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe main findings observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs comprised atrophic, \ninflammatory and/or degenerative changes affecting the epithelia of the cornea (accompanied by \ncorneal translucencies and opacities in dogs at ophthalmology examination), GI tract (including \ntongue), skin, and male and female reproductive tracts with secondary changes in spleen. These \nfindings occurred at plasma concentrations that were below those seen in patients at the 80 mg \ntherapeutic dose. The findings present following 1 month of dosing were largely reversible within 1 \nmonth of cessation of dosing with the exception of partial recovery for some of the corneal changes.\n\nOsimertinib penetrated the intact blood-brain barrier of the cynomolgus monkey (i.v. dosing), rat and \nmouse (oral administration). \n\nNon-clinical data indicate that osimertinib and its metabolite (AZ5104) inhibit the h-ERG channel, \nand QTc prolonging effect cannot be excluded.\n\nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with osimertinib. Osimertinib did not cause genetic \ndamage in in vitro and in vivo assays.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nDegenerative changes were present in the testes in rats and dogs exposed to osimertinib for \u22651 month \nand there was a reduction in male fertility in rats following exposure to osimertinib for 3 months. \nThese findings were seen at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Pathology findings in the testes\nseen following 1 month dosing were reversible in rats; however, a definitive statement on reversibility \nof these lesions in dogs cannot be made.\n\nBased on studies in animals, female fertility may be impaired by treatment with osimertinib. In repeat \ndose toxicity studies, an increased incidence of anoestrus, corpora lutea degeneration in the ovaries \nand epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were seen in rats exposed to osimertinib for \u22651 month \nat clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Findings in the ovaries seen following 1 month dosing \nwere reversible. In a female fertility study in rats, administration of osimertinib at 20 mg/kg/day \n(approximately equal to the recommended daily clinical dose of 80 mg) had no effects on oestrus \ncycling or the number of females becoming pregnant, but caused early embryonic deaths. These \nfindings showed evidence of reversibility following a 1 month off-dose.\n\nIn a modified embryofoetal development study in the rat, osimertinib caused embryolethality when \nadministered to pregnant rats prior to embryonic implantation. These effects were seen at a maternally \ntolerated dose of 20 mg/kg where exposure was equivalent to the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose of 80 mg daily (based on total AUC). Exposure at doses of 20 mg/kg and above \nduring organogenesis caused reduced foetal weights but no adverse effects on external or visceral \nfoetal morphology. When osimertinib was administered to pregnant female rats throughout gestation \nand then through early lactation, there was demonstrable exposure to osimertinib and its metabolites \nin suckling pups plus a reduction in pup survival and poor pup growth (at doses of 20 mg/kg and \nabove).\n\n\n\n26\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What TAGRISSO is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take TAGRISSO\n3. How to take TAGRISSO\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store TAGRISSO\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What TAGRISSO is and what it is used for\n\nTAGRISSO contains the active substance osimertinib, which belongs to a group of medicines called\nprotein kinase inhibitors which are used to treat cancer. TAGRISSO is used to treat adults with a type \nof lung cancer called \u2018non-small cell lung cancer.\u2019 If a test has shown that your cancer has certain \nchanges (mutations) in a gene called \u2018EGFR\u2019 (epidermal growth factor receptor) and has spread to \nyour other lung or other organs, your cancer is likely to respond to treatment with TAGRISSO. \nTAGRISSO can be prescribed for you:\n\n\uf0b7 as the first medicine you receive for your cancer\nor\n\n\uf0b7 in certain circumstances if you have been treated for your cancer before with other protein kinase \ninhibitor medicines.\n\nHow TAGRISSO works\n\nTAGRISSO works by blocking EGFR and may help to slow or stop your lung cancer from growing. \nIt may also help to reduce the size of the tumour.\n\n\uf0b7 If TAGRISSO is the first protein kinase inhibitor medicine you are receiving, it means that your \ncancer contains defects in the EGFR gene, for example \u2018exon 19 deletions\u2019 or \u2018exon 21 \nsubstitution mutations\u2019.  \n\n\uf0b7 If your cancer has progressed while you were being treated with other protein kinase inhibitor \nmedicines, it means that your cancer contains a gene defect called \u2018T790M\u2019. Because of this \ndefect, other protein kinase medicines may no longer work.\n\n\n\n40\n\nIf you have any questions about how this medicine works or why this medicine has been prescribed \nfor you, ask your doctor.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take TAGRISSO\n\nDo not take TAGRISSO if:\n\uf0b7 you are allergic (hypersensitive) to osimertinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n\uf0b7 you are taking St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking TAGRISSO.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking TAGRISSO if:\n\uf0b7 you have suffered from inflammation of your lungs (a condition called \u2018interstitial lung disease\u2019).\n\uf0b7 you have ever had heart problems \u2013 your doctor may want to keep a close eye on you.\n\uf0b7 you have a history of eye problems.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nTell your doctor straight away while taking this medicine if:\n\uf0b7 you have sudden difficulty in breathing together with a cough or fever. \n\uf0b7 you have severe peeling of your skin.\n\nSee \u2018Serious side effects\u2019 in section 4 for more information.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nTAGRISSO has not been studied in children or adolescents. Do not give this medicine to children or \nadolescents under the age of 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and TAGRISSO\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription. This is \nbecause TAGRISSO can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way TAGRISSO works.\n\nTell your doctor before taking TAGRISSO if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\nThe following medicines may reduce how well TAGRISSO works:\n\uf0b7 Phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital \u2013 used for seizures or fits.\n\uf0b7 Rifabutin or rifampicin \u2013 used for tuberculosis (TB).\n\uf0b7 St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) \u2013 an herbal medicine used for depression.\n\nTAGRISSO may affect how well the following medicines work and/or increase side effects of these \nmedicines:\n\uf0b7 Rosuvastatin \u2013 used to lower cholesterol.\n\uf0b7 Oral hormonal contraceptive pill\u2013 used to prevent pregnancy. \n\uf0b7 Bosentan \u2013 used for high blood pressure in the lungs.\n\uf0b7 Efavirenz and etravirine \u2013 used to treat HIV infections/AIDS.\n\uf0b7 Modafinil \u2013 used for sleep disorders.\n\uf0b7 Dabigatran \u2013 used to prevent blood clots.\n\uf0b7 Digoxin \u2013 used for irregular heart beat or other heart problems.\n\n\n\n41\n\n\uf0b7 Aliskiren \u2013 used for high blood pressure.\n\nIf you are taking any of the medicines listed above, tell your doctor before taking TAGRISSO. \nYour doctor will discuss appropriate treatment options with you.\n\nPregnancy \u2013 information for women\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before taking this medicine. If you do become pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor \nstraight away.

called protein kinase inhibitors which are used to treat cancer. tagrisso is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called 'non-small cell lung cancer.' if a test has shown that your cancer has certain changes (mutations) in a gene called 'egfr' (epidermal growth factor receptor) and has spread to your other lung or other organs, your cancer is likely to respond to treatment with tagrisso. tagrisso can be prescribed for you: as the first medicine you receive for your cancer or in certain circumstances if you have been treated for your cancer before with other protein kinase inhibitor medicines. how tagrisso works tagrisso works by blocking egfr and may help to slow or stop your lung cancer from growing. it may also help to reduce the size of the tumour. if tagrisso is the first protein kinase inhibitor medicine you are receiving, it means that your cancer contains defects in the egfr gene, for example 'exon 19 deletions' or 'exon 21 substitution mutations'. if your cancer has progressed while you were being treated with other protein kinase inhibitor medicines, it means that your cancer contains a gene defect called 't790m'. because of this defect, other protein kinase medicines may no longer work. if you have any questions about how this medicine works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
