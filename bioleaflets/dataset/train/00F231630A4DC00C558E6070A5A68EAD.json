CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) \n\nSutent is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal \n\nstromal tumour (GIST) in adults after failure of imatinib treatment due to resistance or intolerance. \n\n \n\nMetastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) \n\nSutent is indicated for the treatment of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) in adults. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNET) \n\nSutent is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic \n\nneuroendocrine tumours (pNET) with disease progression in adults.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTherapy with Sutent should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer \n\nagents. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nFor GIST and MRCC, the recommended dose of Sutent is 50 mg taken orally once daily, for \n\n4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period (Schedule 4/2) to comprise a complete cycle of \n\n6 weeks. \n\n \n\nFor pNET, the recommended dose of Sutent is 37.5 mg taken orally once daily without a scheduled \n\nrest period. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments \n\n \n\nSafety and tolerability  \n\nFor GIST and MRCC, dose modifications in 12.5 mg steps may be applied based on individual safety \n\nand tolerability. Daily dose should not exceed 75 mg nor be decreased below 25 mg. \n\n \n\nFor pNET, dose modification in 12.5 mg steps may be applied based on individual safety and \n\ntolerability. The maximum dose administered in the Phase 3 pNET study was 50 mg daily. \n\n \n\nDose interruptions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers  \n\nCo-administration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampicin, should be avoided \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). If this is not possible, the dose of sunitinib may need to be increased in \n\n12.5 mg steps (up to 87.5 mg per day for GIST and MRCC or 62.5 mg per day for pNET) based on \n\ncareful monitoring of tolerability. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, should be \n\navoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). If this is not possible, the dose of sunitinib may need to be reduced \n\nto a minimum of 37.5 mg daily for GIST and MRCC or 25 mg daily for pNET, based on careful \n\nmonitoring of tolerability.  \n\n \n\nSelection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or \n\ninhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Sutent in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. \n\n \n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \n\nposology can be made. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nApproximately one-third of the patients in clinical studies who received sunitinib were 65 years of age \n\nor over. No significant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between younger and older \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo starting dose adjustment is recommended when administering sunitinib to patients with mild or \n\nmoderate (Child-Pugh class A and B) hepatic impairment. Sunitinib has not been studied in subjects \n\nwith severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment and therefore its use in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment cannot be recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo starting dose adjustment is required when administering sunitinib to patients with renal impairment \n\n(mild-severe) or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. Subsequent dose adjustments \n\nshould be based on individual safety and tolerability (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nSutent is for oral administration. It may be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not be given an additional dose. The patient should take the \n\nusual prescribed dose on the following day. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCo-administration with potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided because it may decrease sunitinib \n\nplasma concentration (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nCo-administration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided because it may increase the \n\nplasma concentration of sunitinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSkin and tissue disorders \n\nPatients should be advised that depigmentation of the hair or skin may occur during treatment with \n\nsunitinib. Other possible dermatological effects may include dryness, thickness or cracking of the skin, \n\nblisters, or rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. \n\n \n\nThe above reactions were not cumulative, were typically reversible, and generally did not result in \n\ntreatment discontinuation. Cases of pyoderma gangrenosum, generally reversible after discontinuation \n\nof sunitinib, have been reported. Severe cutaneous reactions have been reported, including cases of \n\nerythema multiforme (EM), cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis (TEN), some of which were fatal. If signs or symptoms of SJS, TEN, or EM \n\n(e.g., progressive skin rash often with blisters or mucosal lesions) are present, sunitinib treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. If the diagnosis of SJS or TEN is confirmed, treatment must not be restarted. \n\nIn some cases of suspected EM, patients tolerated the reintroduction of sunitinib therapy at a lower \n\ndose after resolution of the reaction; some of these patients also received concomitant treatment with \n\ncorticosteroids or antihistamines (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage and tumour bleeding \n\nHaemorrhagic events, some of which were fatal, reported in clinical studies with sunitinib and during \n\npostmarketing surveillance have included gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary tract, and brain \n\nhaemorrhages (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRoutine assessment of bleeding events should include complete blood counts and physical \n\nexamination. \n\n \n\nEpistaxis was the most common haemorrhagic adverse reaction, having been reported for \n\napproximately half of the patients with solid tumours who experienced haemorrhagic events. Some of \n\nthe epistaxis events were severe, but very rarely fatal. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nEvents of tumour haemorrhage, sometimes associated with tumour necrosis, have been reported; some \n\nof these haemorrhagic events were fatal. \n\n \n\nTumour haemorrhage may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumours, may present as \n\nsevere and life-threatening haemoptysis or pulmonary haemorrhage. Cases of pulmonary \n\nhaemorrhage, some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in clinical trials and have been reported \n\nin postmarketing experience in patients treated with sunitinib for MRCC, GIST, and lung cancer. \n\nSutent is not approved for use in patients with lung cancer.  \n\n \n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, acenocoumarole) may be \n\nperiodically monitored by complete blood counts (platelets), coagulation factors (PT/INR), and \n\nphysical examination. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and stomatitis/oral pain were the most \n\ncommonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions; oesophagitis events have been also reported \n\n(see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nSupportive care for gastrointestinal adverse reactions requiring treatment may include medicinal \n\nproducts with antiemetic, antidiarrhoeal, or antacid properties. \n\n \n\nSerious, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal perforation were \n\nreported in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies treated with sunitinib.  \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nHypertension has been reported in association with sunitinib, including severe hypertension \n\n(> 200 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic). Patients should be screened for hypertension and \n\ncontrolled as appropriate. Temporary suspension is recommended in patients with severe hypertension \n\nthat is not controlled with medical management. Treatment may be resumed once hypertension is \n\nappropriately controlled (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nHaematological disorders \n\nDecreased absolute neutrophil counts and decreased platelet counts were reported in association with \n\nsunitinib (see section 4.8). The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible, and \n\ngenerally did not result in treatment discontinuation. None of these events in the Phase 3 studies were \n\nfatal, but rare fatal haematological events, including haemorrhage associated with thrombocytopenia \n\nand neutropenic infections, have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. \n\n \n\nAnaemia has been observed to occur early as well as late during treatment with sunitinib. \n\n \n\nComplete blood counts should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for patients \n\nreceiving treatment with sunitinib (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCardiovascular events, including heart failure, cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction \n\ndecline to below the lower limit of normal, myocarditis, myocardial ischaemia and myocardial \n\ninfarction, some of which were fatal, have been reported in patients treated with sunitinib. These data \n\nsuggest that sunitinib increases the risk of cardiomyopathy. No specific additional risk factors for \n\nsunitinib-induced cardiomyopathy apart from the drug-specific effect have been identified in the \n\ntreated patients. Use sunitinib with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, \n\nthese events (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to sunitinib administration, such as \n\nmyocardial infarction (including severe/unstable angina), coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, \n\nsymptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack, or \n\npulmonary embolism were excluded from all sunitinib clinical studies. It is unknown whether patients \n\n\n\n6 \n\nwith these concomitant conditions may be at a higher risk of developing sunitinib-related left \n\nventricular dysfunction. \n\n \n\nPhysicians are advised to weigh this risk against the potential benefits of sunitinib. Patients should be \n\ncarefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF while receiving sunitinib especially \n\npatients with cardiac risk factors and/or history of coronary artery disease. Baseline and periodic \n\nevaluations of LVEF should also be considered while the patient is receiving sunitinib. In patients \n\nwithout cardiac risk factors, a baseline evaluation of ejection fraction should be considered. \n\n \n\nIn the presence of clinical manifestations of CHF, discontinuation of sunitinib is recommended. The \n\nadministration of sunitinib should be interrupted and/or the dose reduced in patients without clinical \n\nevidence of CHF but with an ejection fraction < 50% and > 20% below baseline. \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\nProlongation of QT interval and Torsade de pointes have been observed in sunitinib-exposed patients. \n\nQT interval prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including \n\nTorsade de pointes.  \n\n \n\nSunitinib should be used with caution in patients with a known history of QT interval prolongation, \n\npatients who are taking antiarrhythmics or medicinal products that can prolong QT interval, or patients \n\nwith relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. Concomitant \n\nadministration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be limited because of the possible \n\nincrease in sunitinib plasma concentrations (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolic events \n\nTreatment-related venous thromboembolic events were reported in patients who received sunitinib \n\nincluding deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see section 4.8). Cases of pulmonary \n\nembolism with fatal outcome have been observed in postmarketing surveillance.  \n\n \n\nArterial thromboembolic events \n\nCases of arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with sunitinib. The most frequent events included cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic \n\nattack, and cerebral infarction. Risk factors associated with ATE, in addition to the underlying \n\nmalignant disease and age \uf0b3 65 years, included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and prior \n\nthromboembolic disease. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\nThe use of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors in patients with or without \n\nhypertension may promote the formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating \n\nsunitinib, this risk should be carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or \n\nhistory of aneurysm. \n\n \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n\nThe diagnosis of TMA, including thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP) and haemolytic \n\nuraemic syndrome (HUS), sometimes leading to renal failure or a fatal outcome, should be considered \n\nin the occurrence of haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, fluctuating neurological \n\nmanifestation, renal impairment, and fever. Sunitinib therapy should be discontinued in patients who \n\ndevelop TMA and prompt treatment is required. Reversal of the effects of TMA has been observed \n\nafter treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThyroid dysfunction  \n\nBaseline laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended in all patients. Patients with \n\npre-existing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice \n\nprior to the start of sunitinib treatment. During sunitinib treatment, routine monitoring of thyroid \n\nfunction should be performed every 3 months. In addition, patients should be observed closely for \n\nsigns and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during treatment, and patients who develop any signs \n\nand/or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction should have laboratory testing of thyroid function \n\n\n\n7 \n\nperformed as clinically indicated. Patients who develop thyroid dysfunction should be treated as per \n\nstandard medical practice. \n\n \n\nHypothyroidism has been observed to occur early as well as late during treatment with sunitinib (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nPancreatitis  \n\nIncreases in serum lipase and amylase activities were observed in patients with various solid tumours \n\nwho received sunitinib. Increases in lipase activities were transient and were generally not \n\naccompanied by signs or symptoms of pancreatitis in subjects with various solid tumours (see section \n\n4.8).  \n\n \n\nCases of serious pancreatic events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported. If symptoms of \n\npancreatitis are present, patients should have sunitinib discontinued and be provided with appropriate \n\nsupportive care. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\nHepatotoxicity has been observed in patients treated with sunitinib. Cases of hepatic failure, some with \n\na fatal outcome, were observed in < 1% of solid tumour patients treated with sunitinib. Monitor liver \n\nfunction tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin levels) before \n\ninitiation of treatment, during each cycle of treatment, and as clinically indicated. If signs or symptoms \n\nof hepatic failure are present, sunitinib should be discontinued and appropriate supportive care should \n\nbe provided (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\nCases of renal impairment, renal failure and/or acute renal failure, in some cases with fatal outcome, \n\nhave been reported (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRisk factors associated with renal impairment/failure in patients receiving sunitinib included, in \n\naddition to underlying RCC, older age, diabetes mellitus, underlying renal impairment, cardiac failure, \n\nhypertension, sepsis, dehydration/hypovolaemia, and rhabdomyolysis. \n\n \n\nThe safety of continued sunitinib treatment in patients with moderate to severe proteinuria has not \n\nbeen systematically evaluated.  \n\n \n\nCases of proteinuria and rare cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported. Baseline urinalysis is \n\nrecommended, and patients should be monitored for the development or worsening of proteinuria. \n\nDiscontinue sunitinib in patients with nephrotic syndrome. \n\n \n\nFistula \n\nIf fistula formation occurs, sunitinib treatment should be interrupted. Limited information is available \n\non the continued use of sunitinib in patients with fistulae (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nImpaired wound healing \n\nCases of impaired wound healing have been reported during sunitinib therapy. \n\n \n\nNo formal clinical studies of the effect of sunitinib on wound healing have been conducted. \n\nTemporary interruption of sunitinib therapy is recommended for precautionary reasons in patients \n\nundergoing major surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience regarding the timing of \n\nreinitiation of therapy following major surgical intervention. Therefore, the decision to resume \n\nsunitinib therapy following a major surgical intervention should be based upon clinical judgment of \n\nrecovery from surgery. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \n\nCases of ONJ have been reported in patients treated with Sutent. The majority of cases were reported \n\nin patients who had received prior or concomitant treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates, for \n\n\n\n8 \n\nwhich ONJ is an identified risk. Caution should therefore be exercised when Sutent and intravenous \n\nbisphosphonates are used either simultaneously or sequentially. \n\n \n\nInvasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. Prior to treatment with Sutent, a dental \n\nexamination and appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered. In patients who have \n\npreviously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates, invasive dental procedures should \n\nbe avoided if possible (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity/angioedema \n\nIf angioedema due to hypersensitivity occurs, sunitinib treatment should be interrupted and standard \n\nmedical care provided (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSeizures \n\nIn clinical studies of sunitinib and from postmarketing surveillance, seizures have been reported. \n\nPatients with seizures and signs/symptoms consistent with posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy \n\nsyndrome (RPLS), such as hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning \n\nand visual loss, including cortical blindness, should be controlled with medical management including \n\ncontrol of hypertension. Temporary suspension of sunitinib is recommended; following resolution, \n\ntreatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating physician (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n\nCases of TLS, some fatal, have been rarely observed in clinical trials and have been reported in \n\npostmarketing surveillance in patients treated with sunitinib. Risk factors for TLS include high tumour \n\nburden, pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency, oliguria, dehydration, hypotension, and acidic urine. \n\nThese patients should be monitored closely and treated as clinically indicated, and prophylactic \n\nhydration should be considered. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nSerious infections, with or without neutropenia, including some with a fatal outcome, have been \n\nreported. Uncommon cases of necrotising fasciitis, including of the perineum, sometimes fatal, have \n\nbeen reported (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nSunitinib therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis, and appropriate \n\ntreatment should be promptly initiated. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nDecreases in blood glucose, in some cases clinically symptomatic and requiring hospitalisation due to \n\nloss of consciousness, have been reported during sunitinib treatment. In case of symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemia, sunitinib should be temporarily interrupted. Blood glucose levels in diabetic patients \n\nshould be checked regularly in order to assess if antidiabetic medicinal product\u2019s dosage needs to be \n\nadjusted to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations \n\nEffect of CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nIn healthy volunteers, concomitant administration of a single dose of sunitinib with the potent \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in an increase of the combined [sunitinib + primary \n\nmetabolite] maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0-\uf0a5) values of 49% and \n\n51%, respectively. \n\n \n\nAdministration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, \n\nclarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase sunitinib concentrations. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nCombination with CYP3A4 inhibitors should therefore be avoided, or the selection of an alternate \n\nconcomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. \n\n \n\nIf this is not possible, the dose of Sutent may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily for \n\nGIST and MRCC or 25 mg daily for pNET, based on careful monitoring of tolerability (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nEffect of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) inhibitors \n\nLimited clinical data are available on the interaction between sunitinib and BCRP inhibitors and the \n\npossibility of an interaction between sunitinib and other BCRP inhibitors cannot be excluded (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations \n\nEffect of CYP3A4 inducers \n\nIn healthy volunteers, concomitant administration of a single dose of sunitinib with the \n\nCYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction of the combined [sunitinib + primary metabolite] \n\nCmax and AUC0-\uf0a5 values of 23% and 46%, respectively. \n\n \n\nAdministration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, \n\ncarbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s \n\nWort/Hypericum perforatum) may decrease sunitinib concentrations. Combination with \n\nCYP3A4 inducers should therefore be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal \n\nproduct, with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. If this is not possible, \n\nthe dose of Sutent may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87.5 mg per day for GIST \n\nand MRCC or 62.5 mg per day for pNET), based on careful monitoring of tolerability (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception and avoid becoming \n\npregnant while receiving treatment with Sutent. \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nThere are no studies in pregnant women using sunitinib. Studies in animals have shown reproductive \n\ntoxicity including foetal malformations (see section 5.3). Sutent should not be used during pregnancy \n\nor in women not using effective contraception, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \n\nthe foetus. If Sutent is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while on treatment \n\nwith Sutent, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nSunitinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in rat milk. It is not known whether sunitinib or its \n\nprimary active metabolite is excreted in human milk. Because active substances are commonly \n\nexcreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding \n\ninfants, women should not breast-feed while taking Sutent. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nBased on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with \n\nsunitinib (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nSutent has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised that \n\nthey may experience dizziness during treatment with sunitinib. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most serious adverse reactions associated with sunitinib, some fatal, are renal failure, heart failure, \n\npulmonary embolism, gastrointestinal perforation, and haemorrhages (e.g., respiratory tract, \n\ngastrointestinal, tumour, urinary tract, and brain haemorrhages). The most common adverse reactions \n\nof any grade (experienced by patients in RCC, GIST, and pNET registrational trials) included \n\ndecreased appetite, taste disturbance, hypertension, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders (i.e. diarrhoea, \n\nnausea, stomatitis, dyspepsia, and vomiting), skin discolouration, and palmar-plantar \n\nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome. These symptoms may diminish as treatment continues. \n\nHypothyroidism may develop during treatment. Haematological disorders (e.g., neutropenia, \n\nthrombocytopenia, and anaemia) are amongst the most common adverse drug reactions. \n\n \n\nFatal events other than those listed in section 4.4 above or in section 4.8 below that were considered \n\npossibly related to sunitinib included multi-system organ failure, disseminated intravascular \n\ncoagulation, peritoneal haemorrhage, adrenal insufficiency, pneumothorax, shock, and sudden death. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions that were reported in GIST, MRCC, and pNET patients in a pooled dataset of \n\n7,115 patients are listed below, by system organ class, frequency and grade of severity (NCI-CTCAE). \n\nPost-marketing adverse reactions identified in clinical studies are also included. Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\uf0b31/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 \n\nto <1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \n\nthe available data). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

have \n\nbeen reported. Cases of necrotising fasciitis, including of the perineum, sometimes fatal, have been \n\nreported (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nDecreased absolute neutrophil counts of Grade 3 and 4 severities, respectively, were reported in 10% \n\nand 1.7% of patients on the Phase 3 GIST study, in 16% and 1.6% of patients on the Phase 3 MRCC \n\nstudy, and in 13% and 2.4% of patients on the Phase 3 pNET study. Decreased platelet counts of \n\nGrade 3 and 4 severities, respectively, were reported in 3.7% and 0.4% of patients on the Phase 3 \n\nGIST study, in 8.2% and 1.1% of patients on the Phase 3 MRCC study, and in 3.7% and 1.2% of \n\npatients on the Phase 3 pNET study (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBleeding events were reported in 18% of patients receiving sunitinib in a Phase 3 GIST study vs 17% \n\nof patients receiving placebo. In patients receiving sunitinib for treatment-na\u00efve MRCC, 39% had \n\nbleeding events vs 11% of patients receiving interferon-\uf061 (IFN-\u03b1). Seventeen (4.5%) patients on \n\nsunitinib versus 5 (1.7%) patients on IFN-\u03b1 experienced Grade 3 or greater bleeding events. Of \n\npatients receiving sunitinib for cytokine-refractory MRCC, 26% experienced bleeding. Bleeding \n\nevents, excluding epistaxis, were reported in 21.7% of patients receiving sunitinib in the Phase 3 \n\npNET study compared to 9.85% of patients receiving placebo (see section 4.4) \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, tumour haemorrhage was reported in approximately 2% of patients with GIST. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, have been reported (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEndocrine disorders \n\nHypothyroidism was reported as an adverse reaction in 7 patients (4%) receiving sunitinib across the \n\n2 cytokine-refractory MRCC studies; in 61 patients (16%) on sunitinib and 3 patients (< 1%) in the \n\nIFN-\uf061 arm in the treatment-na\u00efve MRCC study.  \n\n \n\nAdditionally, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevations were reported in 4 cytokine-refractory \n\nMRCC patients (2%). Overall, 7% of the MRCC population had either clinical or laboratory evidence \n\nof treatment-emergent hypothyroidism. Acquired hypothyroidism was noted in 6.2% of GIST patients \n\non sunitinib versus 1% on placebo. In the Phase 3 pNET study hypothyroidism was reported in \n\n6 patients (7.2%) receiving sunitinib and in 1 patient (1.2%) on placebo. \n\n \n\nThyroid function was monitored prospectively in 2 studies in patients with breast cancer; Sutent is not \n\napproved for use in breast cancer. In 1 study, hypothyroidism was reported in 15 (13.6%) patients on \n\nsunitinib and 3 (2.9%) patients on standard of care. Blood TSH increase was reported in 1 (0.9%) \n\npatient on sunitinib and no patients on standard of care. Hyperthyroidism was reported in no \n\nsunitinib-treated patients and 1 (1.0%) patient receiving standard of care. In the other study \n\nhypothyroidism was reported in a total of 31 (13%) patients on sunitinib and 2 (0.8%) patients on \n\ncapecitabine. Blood TSH increase was reported in 12 (5.0%) patients on sunitinib and no patients on \n\ncapecitabine. Hyperthyroidism was reported in 4 (1.7%) patients on sunitinib and no patients on \n\ncapecitabine. Blood TSH decrease was reported in 3 (1.3%) patients on sunitinib and no patients on \n\ncapecitabine. T4 increase was reported in 2 (0.8%) patients on sunitinib and 1 (0.4%) patient on \n\ncapecitabine. T3 increase was reported in 1 (0.8%) patient on sunitinib and no patients on \n\ncapecitabine. All thyroid-related events reported were Grade 1-2 (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nA higher incidence rate of hypoglycaemia events was reported in patients with pNET in comparison to \n\nMRCC and GIST. Nevertheless, most of these adverse events observed in clinical studies were not \n\nconsidered related to study treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nIn clinical studies of sunitinib and from postmarketing surveillance, there have been few reports \n\n(< 1%), some fatal, of subjects presenting with seizures and radiological evidence of RPLS. Seizures \n\nhave been observed in patients with or without radiological evidence of brain metastases (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nIn clinical trials, decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \uf0b3 20% and below the lower \n\nlimit of normal were reported in approximately 2% of sunitinib-treated GIST patients, 4% of \n\ncytokine-refractory MRCC patients, and 2% of placebo-treated GIST patients. These LVEF declines \n\ndo not appear to have been progressive and often improved as treatment continued. In the \n\ntreatment-na\u00efve MRCC study, 27% of patients on sunitinib and 15% of patients on IFN-\uf061 had an \n\nLVEF value below the lower limit of normal. Two patients (< 1%) who received sunitinib were \n\ndiagnosed with CHF.  \n\n \n\nIn GIST patients \u2018cardiac failure\u2019, \u2018cardiac failure congestive\u2019, or \u2018left ventricular failure\u2019 were \n\nreported in 1.2% of patients treated with sunitinib and 1% of patients treated with placebo. In the \n\npivotal Phase 3 GIST study (N = 312), treatment-related fatal cardiac reactions were reported in 1% of \n\npatients on each arm of the study (i.e. sunitinib and placebo arms). In a Phase 2 study in \n\ncytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 0.9% of patients experienced treatment-related fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction and in the Phase 3 study in treatment-na\u00efve MRCC patients, 0.6% of patients on the IFN-\uf061 \n\narm and 0% of patients on the sunitinib arm experienced fatal cardiac events. In the Phase 3 pNET \n\nstudy, 1 (1%) patient who received sunitinib had treatment-related fatal cardiac failure.  \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  \n\nHypertension \n\nHypertension was a very common adverse reaction reported in clinical trials. The dose of sunitinib \n\nwas reduced or its administration temporarily suspended in approximately 2.7% of the patients who \n\nexperienced hypertension. Sunitinib was not permanently discontinued in any of these patients. Severe \n\nhypertension (> 200 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic) was reported in 4.7% of patients with \n\nsolid tumours. Hypertension was reported in approximately 33.9% of patients receiving sunitinib for \n\ntreatment-na\u00efve MRCC compared to 3.6% of patients receiving IFN-\uf061. Severe hypertension was \n\nreported in 12% of treatment-na\u00efve patients on sunitinib and < 1% of patients on IFN-\uf061. Hypertension \n\nwas reported in 26.5% of patients receiving sunitinib in a Phase 3 pNET study, compared to 4.9% of \n\npatients receiving placebo. Severe hypertension was reported in 10% of pNET patients on sunitinib \n\nand 3% of patients on placebo. \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolic events \n\nTreatment-related venous thromboembolic events were reported in approximately 1.0% of patients \n\nwith solid tumours who received sunitinib on clinical trials, including GIST and RCC. \n\n \n\nSeven patients (3%) on sunitinib and none on placebo in a Phase 3 GIST study experienced venous \n\nthromboembolic events; 5 of the 7 were Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and 2 were Grade 1 \n\nor 2. Four of these 7 GIST patients discontinued treatment following first observation of DVT. \n\n \n\nThirteen patients (3%) receiving sunitinib in the Phase 3 treatment-na\u00efve MRCC study and 4 patients \n\n(2%) on the 2 cytokine-refractory MRCC studies had venous thromboembolic events reported. Nine of \n\nthese patients had pulmonary embolisms; 1 was Grade 2 and 8 were Grade 4. Eight of these patients \n\nhad DVT; 1 with Grade 1, 2 with Grade 2, 4 with Grade 3, and 1 with Grade 4. One patient with \n\npulmonary embolism in the cytokine-refractory MRCC study experienced dose interruption. \n\n \n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve MRCC patients receiving IFN-\uf061, 6 (2%) venous thromboembolic events were \n\nreported; 1 patient (< 1%) experienced a Grade 3 DVT and 5 patients (1%) had pulmonary embolisms, \n\nall with Grade 4. \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolic events were reported for 1 (1.2%) patient in the sunitinib arm and 5 (6.1%) \n\npatients in the placebo arm in the Phase 3 pNET study. Two of these patients on placebo had DVT, \n\n1 with Grade 2 and 1 with Grade 3. \n\n \n\nNo cases with fatal outcome were reported in GIST, MRCC, and pNET registrational studies. Cases \n\nwith fatal outcome have been observed in the postmarketing surveillance. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nCases of pulmonary embolism were observed in approximately 3.1% of patients with GIST and in \n\napproximately 1.2% of patients with MRCC, who received sunitinib in Phase 3 studies. No pulmonary \n\nembolism was reported for patients with pNET who received sunitinib in the Phase 3 study. Rare cases \n\nwith fatal outcome have been observed in the postmarketing surveillance. \n\n \n\nPatients who presented with pulmonary embolism within the previous 12 months were excluded from \n\nsunitinib clinical studies. \n\n \n\nIn patients who received sunitinib in Phase 3 registrational studies, pulmonary events (i.e. dyspnoea, \n\npleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary oedema) were reported in approximately 17.8% \n\nof patients with GIST, in approximately 26.7% of patients with MRCC and in 12% of patients with \n\npNET. \n\n \n\nApproximately 22.2% of patients with solid tumours, including GIST and MRCC, who received \n\nsunitinib in clinical trials experienced pulmonary events. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nPancreatitis has been observed uncommonly (< 1%) in patients receiving sunitinib for GIST or \n\nMRCC. No treatment-related pancreatitis was reported in the Phase 3 pNET study (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFatal gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.98% of patients receiving placebo in the GIST Phase \n\n3 study. \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nHepatic dysfunction has been reported and may include Liver Function Test abnormalities, hepatitis, \n\nor liver failure (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCases of pyoderma gangrenosum, generally reversible after discontinuation of sunitinib, have been \n\nreported (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCases of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis, some with acute renal failure, have been reported. Patients \n\nwith signs or symptoms of muscle toxicity should be managed as per standard medical practice (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nCases of fistula formation, sometimes associated with tumour necrosis and regression, in some cases \n\nwith fatal outcomes, have been reported (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCases of ONJ have been reported in patients treated with Sutent, most of which occurred in patients \n\nwho had identified risk factors for ONJ, in particular, exposure to intravenous bisphosphonates and/or \n\na history of dental disease requiring invasive dental procedures (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nData from non clinical (in vitro and in vivo) studies, at doses higher than the recommended human \n\ndose, indicated that sunitinib has the potential to inhibit the cardiac action potential repolarisation \n\nprocess (e.g., prolongation of QT interval).  \n\n \n\nIncreases in the QTc interval to over 500 msec were reported in 0.5%, and changes from baseline in \n\nexcess of 60 msec were reported in 1.1% of the 450 solid tumour patients; both of these parameters are \n\nrecognised as potentially significant changes. At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, \n\nsunitinib has been shown to prolong the QTcF interval (Fridericia corrected QT interval). \n\n \n\nQTc interval prolongation was investigated in a trial in 24 patients, ages 20-87 years, with advanced \n\nmalignancies. The results of this study demonstrated that sunitinib had an effect on QTc interval \n\n(defined as a mean placebo-adjusted change of > 10 msec with a 90% confidence interval [CI] upper \n\nlimit > 15 msec) at therapeutic concentration (Day 3) using the within-day baseline correction method, \n\n\n\n16 \n\nand at greater than therapeutic concentration (Day 9) using both baseline correction methods. No \n\npatients had a QTc interval > 500 msec. Although an effect on QTcF interval was observed on Day 3 \nat 24 hours postdose (i.e., at therapeutic plasma concentration expected after the recommended starting \n\ndose of 50 mg) with the within-day baseline correction method, the clinical significance of this finding \n\nis unclear. \n\n \n\nUsing comprehensive serial ECG assessments at times corresponding to either therapeutic or greater \n\nthan therapeutic exposures, none of the patients in the evaluable or intent-to-treat (ITT) populations \n\nwere observed to develop QTc interval prolongation considered as \u201csevere\u201d (i.e. equal to or greater \n\nthan Grade 3 by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 3.0).  \n\n \n\nAt therapeutic plasma concentrations, the maximum QTcF interval (Frederica\u2019s correction) mean \n\nchange from baseline was 9 msec (90% CI: 15.1 msec). At approximately twice therapeutic \n\nconcentrations, the maximum QTcF interval change from baseline was 15.4 msec (90% \n\nCI: 22.4 msec). Moxifloxacin (400 mg) used as a positive control showed a 5.6 msec maximum mean \n\nQTcF interval change from baseline. No subjects experienced an effect on the QTc interval greater \n\nthan Grade 2 (CTCAE version 3.0) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLong-term safety in MRCC \n\nThe long-term safety of sunitinib in patients with MRCC was analysed across 9 completed clinical \n\nstudies conducted in the first-line, bevacizumab-refractory, and cytokine-refractory treatment settings \n\nin 5,739 patients, of whom 807 (14%) were treated for \u2265 2 years up to 6 years. In the 807 patients who \n\nreceived long-term sunitinib treatment, most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred \n\ninitially in the first 6 months\u20131 year and then were stable or decreased in frequency over time, with the \n\nexception of hypothyroidism, which gradually increased over time, with new cases occurring over the \n\n6 year period. Prolonged treatment with sunitinib did not appear to be associated with new types of \n\nTRAEs. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety profile of sunitinib has been derived from a Phase 1 dose-escalation study, a Phase 2 \n\nopen-label study, a Phase 1/2 single-arm study and from publications as described below. \n\n \n\nA Phase 1 dose-escalation study of oral sunitinib was conducted in 35 patients comprised of \n\n30 paediatric patients (aged 3 years to 17 years) and 5 young adult patients (aged 18 to 21 years), with \n\nrefractory solid tumours, the majority of whom had a primary diagnosis of brain tumour. All study \n\nparticipants experienced adverse drug reactions; most of these were severe (toxicity grade \u2265 3) and \n\nincluded cardiac toxicity. The most common adverse drug reactions were gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, \n\nneutropenia, fatigue, and ALT elevation. The risk of cardiac adverse drug reactions appeared to be \n\nhigher in paediatric patients with previous exposure to cardiac irradiation or anthracycline compared \n\nto those paediatric patients without previous exposure. In these paediatric patients without previous \n\nexposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been \n\nidentified (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nA phase 2 open-label study was conducted in 29 patients comprised of 27 paediatric patients (aged \n\n3 years to 16 years) and 2 young adult patients (aged 18 years to 19 years) with \n\nrecurrent/progressive/refractory high grade glioma (HGG) or ependymoma. There were no Grade 5 \n\nadverse reactions in either group. The most common (\u226510%) treatment-related adverse events were \n\nneutrophil count decreased (6 [20.7%] patients) and haemorrhage intracranial (3[10.3%] patients). \n\n \n\nA Phase 1/2 single-arm, study was conducted in 6 paediatric patients (aged 13 years to 16 years) with \n\nadvanced unresectable GIST. The most frequent adverse drug reactions were diarrhoea, nausea, WBC \n\ncount decreased, neutropenia, and headache in 3 (50.0%) patients each, primarily Grade 1 or 2 in \n\nseverity. Four out of 6 patients (66.7%) experienced Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events \n\n(Grade 3 hypophosphataemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient each and a Grade 4 \n\nneutropenia in 1 patient). There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 5 adverse drug \n\nreactions reported in this study. In both the clinical study and the publications, the safety profile was \n\nconsistent with the known safety profile in adults.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Sutent and treatment of overdose should consist of \n\ngeneral supportive measures. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance may be achieved \n\nby emesis or gastric lavage. Cases of overdose have been reported; some cases were associated with \n\nadverse reactions consistent with the known safety profile of sunitinib. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01XE04 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nSunitinib inhibits multiple RTKs that are implicated in tumour growth, neoangiogenesis, and \n\nmetastatic progression of cancer. Sunitinib was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth \n\nfactor receptors (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3), stem \n\ncell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor \n\n(CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). The primary metabolite \n\nexhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe clinical safety and efficacy of sunitinib has been studied in the treatment of patients with GIST \n\nwho were resistant to imatinib (i.e., those who experienced disease progression during or following \n\ntreatment with imatinib) or intolerant to imatinib (i.e., those who experienced significant toxicity \n\nduring treatment with imatinib that precluded further treatment), the treatment of patients with MRCC, \n\nand the treatment of patients with unresectable pNET.  \n\nEfficacy is based on time-to-tumour progression (TTP) and an increase in survival in GIST, on \n\nprogression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORR) for treatment-na\u00efve and \n\ncytokine-refractory MRCC respectively, and on PFS for pNET. \n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumours  \n\nAn initial open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted in patients with GIST after failure of \n\nimatinib (median maximum daily dose 800 mg) due to resistance or intolerance. Ninety-seven patients \n\nwere enrolled at various doses and schedules; 55 patients received 50 mg at the recommended \n\ntreatment Schedule 4 weeks on /2 weeks off (\u201cSchedule 4/2\u201d). \n\nIn this study, the median TTP was 34.0 weeks (95% CI: 22.0, 46.0). \n\nA Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sunitinib was conducted in patients \n\nwith GIST who were intolerant to, or had experienced disease progression during or following \n\ntreatment with imatinib (median maximum daily dose 800 mg). In this study, 312 patients were \n\nrandomised (2:1) to receive either 50 mg sunitinib or placebo, orally once daily on Schedule 4/2 until \n\ndisease progression or withdrawal from the study for another reason (207 patients received sunitinib \n\nand 105 patients received placebo). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was TTP, defined as \n\nthe time from randomisation to first documentation of objective tumour progression. At the time of the \n\nprespecified interim analysis, the median TTP on sunitinib was 28.9 weeks (95% CI: 21.3, 34.1) as \n\nassessed by the investigator and 27.3 weeks (95% CI: 16.0, 32.1) as assessed by the independent \n\n\n\n18 \n\nreview and was statistically significantly longer than the TTP on placebo of 5.1 weeks \n\n(95% CI: 4.4, 10.1) as assessed by the investigator and 6.4 weeks (95% CI: 4.4, 10.0) as assessed by \n\nthe independent review. The difference in overall survival (OS) was statistically in favour of sunitinib \n\n[hazard ratio (HR): 0.491; (95% CI: 0.290, 0.831)]; the risk of death was 2 times higher in patients in \n\nthe placebo arm compared to the sunitinib arm.  \n\n \n\nAfter the interim analysis of efficacy and safety, at the recommendation of the independent Data and \n\nSafety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the study was unblinded and patients on the placebo arm were \n\noffered open-label sunitinib treatment. \n\n \n\nA total of 255 patients received sunitinib in the open-label treatment phase of the study, including \n\n99 patients who were initially treated with placebo.  \n\n \n\nThe analyses of primary and secondary endpoints in the open-label phase of the study reaffirmed the \n\nresults obtained at the time of the interim analysis, as shown in Table 2: \n\n \n\nTable 2.

In this analysis, the placebo arm included \n\nthose patients randomised to placebo who subsequently received open-label sunitinib treatment. \n\n \n\nTreatment-na\u00efve metastatic renal cell carcinoma  \n\nA Phase 3, randomised, multi-centre, international study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sunitinib \n\ncompared with IFN-\uf061 in treatment-na\u00efve MRCC patients was conducted. Seven hundred and fifty \n\npatients were randomised 1:1 to the treatment arms; they received treatment with either sunitinib in \n\nrepeated 6-week cycles, consisting of 4 weeks of 50 mg daily oral administration followed by 2 weeks \n\n\n\n19 \n\nof rest (Schedule 4/2), or IFN-\u03b1, administered as a subcutaneous injection of 3 million units (MU) the \n\nfirst week, 6 MU the second week, and 9 MU the third week and thereafter, on 3 nonconsecutive days \n\neach week.  \n\n \n\nThe median duration of treatment was 11.1 months (range: 0.4-46.1) for sunitinib treatment and \n\n4.1 months (range: 0.1-45.6) for IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Treatment-related serious adverse events (TRSAEs) \n\nwere reported in 23.7% of patients receiving sunitinib and in 6.9% of patients receiving IFN-\u03b1. \n\nHowever, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 20% for sunitinib and 23% for IFN-\u03b1. \n\nDose interruptions occurred in 202 patients (54%) on sunitinib and 141 patients (39%) on IFN-\u03b1. Dose \n\nreductions occurred in 194 patients (52%) on sunitinib and 98 patients (27%) on IFN-\u03b1. Patients were \n\ntreated until disease progression or withdrawal from the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was \n\nPFS. A planned interim analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for sunitinib over IFN-\u03b1, \n\nin this study, the median PFS for the sunitinib-treated group was 47.3 weeks, compared with \n\n22.0 weeks for the IFN-\u03b1-treated group; the HR was 0.415 (95% CI: 0.320, 0.539; p-value < 0.001). \n\nOther endpoints included ORR, OS, and safety. Core radiology assessment was discontinued after the \n\nprimary endpoint had been met. At the final analysis, the ORR as determined by the investigator\u2019s \n\nassessment was 46% (95% CI: 41%, 51%) for the sunitinib arm and 12.0% (95% CI: 9%, 16%) for the \n\nIFN-\u03b1 arm (p<0.001). \n\n \n\nSunitinib treatment was associated with longer survival compared to IFN-\u03b1. The median OS was \n\n114.6 weeks for the sunitinib arm (95% CI: 100.1, 142.9) and 94.9 weeks for the IFN-\u03b1 arm \n\n(95% CI: 77.7, 117.0) with a hazard ratio of 0.821 (95% CI: 0.673, 1.001; p=0.0510 by unstratified \n\nlog-rank).  \n\n \n\nThe overall PFS and OS, observed in the ITT population, as determined by the core radiology \n\nlaboratory assessment, are summarised in Table 3. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Sixty-three patients received a starting dose of 50 mg sunitinib orally, \n\nonce daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period, to comprise a complete cycle of \n\n6 weeks (Schedule 4/2). The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, based on Response Evaluation \n\nCriteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST). \n\n \n\nIn this study the objective response rate was 36.5% (95% CI: 24.7%, 49.6%) and the median TTP was \n\n37.7 weeks (95% CI: 24.0, 46.4). \n\n \n\nA confirmatory, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of \n\nsunitinib was conducted in patients with MRCC who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy. One \n\nhundred and 6 patients received at least one 50 mg dose of sunitinib on Schedule 4/2. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of this study was ORR. Secondary endpoints included TTP, duration of \n\nresponse (DR) and OS. \n\n \n\nIn this study the ORR was 35.8% (95% CI: 26.8% , 47.5 %). The median DR and OS had not yet been \n\nreached. \n\n \n\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumours \n\nA supportive Phase 2, open-label, multi-centre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of single-agent \n\nsunitinib 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 in patients with unresectable pNET. In a pancreatic islet cell \n\ntumour cohort of 66 patients, the primary endpoint of response rate was 17%.  \n\n \n\nA pivotal Phase 3, multi-centre, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of \n\nsingle-agent sunitinib was conducted in patients with unresectable pNET.  \n\n \n\nPatients were required to have documented progression, based on RECIST, within the prior 12 months \n\nand were randomised (1:1) to receive either 37.5 mg sunitinib once daily without a scheduled rest \n\nperiod (N = 86) or placebo (N = 85).  \n\n \n\nThe primary objective was to compare PFS in patients receiving sunitinib versus patients receiving \n\nplacebo. Other endpoints included OS, ORR, PROs, and safety.  \n\n \n\nDemographics were comparable between the sunitinib and placebo groups. Additionally, 49% of \n\nsunitinib patients had nonfunctioning tumours versus 52% of placebo patients and 92% of patients in \n\nboth arms had liver metastases.  \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nUse of somatostatin analogues was allowed in the study. \n\n \n\nA total of 66% of sunitinib patients received prior systemic therapy compared with 72% of placebo \n\npatients. In addition, 24% of sunitinib patients had received somatostatin analogues compared with \n\n22% of placebo patients. \n\n \n\nA clinically significant advantage in investigator-assessed PFS for sunitinib over placebo was \n\nobserved. The median PFS was 11.4 months for the sunitinib arm compared to 5.5 months for the \n\nplacebo arm [hazard ratio: 0.418 (95% CI: 0.263, 0.662), p-value=0.0001]; similar results were \n\nobserved when derived tumour response assessments based upon application of RECIST to \n\ninvestigator tumour measurements were used to determine disease progression, as shown in Table 4. \n\nA hazard ratio favouring sunitinib was observed in all subgroups of baseline characteristics evaluated, \n\nincluding an analysis by number of prior systemic therapies. A total of 29 patients in the sunitinib arm \n\nand 24 in the placebo arm had received no prior systemic treatment; among these patients, the hazard \n\nratio for PFS was 0.365 (95% CI: 0.156, 0.857), p=0.0156. Similarly, among 57 patients in the \n\nsunitinib arm (including 28 with 1 prior systemic therapy and 29 with 2 or more prior systemic \n\ntherapies) and 61 patients in the placebo arm (including 25 with 1 prior systemic therapy and 36 with 2 \n\nor more prior systemic therapies), the hazard ratio for PFS was 0.456 (95% CI: 0.264, 0.787), \n\np=0.0036. \n\n \n\nA sensitivity analysis of PFS was conducted where progression was based upon investigator-reported \n\ntumour measurements and where all subjects censored for reasons other than study termination were \n\ntreated as PFS events. This analysis provided a conservative estimate of the treatment effect of \n\nsunitinib and supported the primary analysis, demonstrating a hazard ratio of 0.507 (95% CI: 0.350, \n\n0.733), p=0.000193. The pivotal study in pancreatic NET was terminated prematurely at the \n\nrecommendation of an independent drug monitoring committee and the primary endpoint was based \n\nupon investigator assessment, both of which may have affected the estimates of the treatment effect.  \n\n \n\nIn order to rule out bias in the investigator-based assessment of PFS, a BICR of scans was performed; \n\nthis review supported the investigator assessment, as shown in Table 4. \n\n \n\nTable 4 - pNET efficacy results from the Phase 3 study \n\nEfficacy parameter Sutent \n\n(N = 86) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N = 85) \n\nHazard Ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n\nProgression-free survival [median, \n\nmonths (95% CI)] by Investigator \n\nAssessment \n\n11.4 \n\n(7.4, 19.8) \n\n5.5 \n\n(3.6, 7.4) \n\n0.418 \n\n(0.263, 0.662) \n\n0.0001a \n\nProgression-free survival [median, \n\nmonths (95% CI)] by derived tumour \n\nresponse assessment based upon \n\napplication of RECIST to \n\ninvestigator tumour assessments \n\n12.6 \n\n(7.4, 16.9) \n\n5.4 \n\n(3.5, 6.0) \n\n0.401 \n\n(0.252, 0.640) \n\n0.000066a \n\nProgression-free survival [median, \n\nmonths (95% CI)] by blinded \n\nindependent central review of \n\ntumour assessments \n\n12.6 \n\n(11.1, 20.6) \n\n5.8 \n\n(3.8, 7.2) \n\n0.315 \n\n(0.181, 0.546) \n\n0.000015a \n\nOverall survival [5 years follow-up] \n\n[median, months (95% CI)] \n\n38.6 \n\n(25.6, 56.4) \n\n29.1 \n\n(16.4, 36.8) \n\n0.730 \n\n(0.504, 1.057) \n\n0.0940a \n\nObjective response rate \n\n[%, (95% CI)] \n\n9.3 \n\n(3.2, 15.4) \n\n0 NA 0.0066b \n\nAbbreviations: CI=confidence interval; N=number of patients; NA=not applicable; pNET=pancreatic \n\nneuroendocrine tumours; RECIST=response evaluation criteria in solid tumours. \na  2-sided unstratified log-rank test \nb  Fisher\u2019s Exact test \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nFigure 1.

There were 9 deaths in the sunitinib arm and \n\n21 deaths in the placebo arm.  \n\n \n\nUpon disease progression, patients were unblinded and placebo patients were offered access to \n\nopen-label sunitinib in a separate extension study. As a result of the early study closure, remaining \n\npatients were unblinded and offered access to open-label sunitinib in an extension study. A total of 59 \n\nout of 85 patients (69.4%) from the placebo arm crossed over to open-label sunitinib following disease \n\nprogression or unblinding at study closure. OS observed after 5 years of follow-up in the extension \n\nstudy showed a hazard ratio of 0.730 (95% CI: 0.504, 1.057).  \n\n \n\nResults from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life \n\nQuestionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) showed that the overall global health-related quality of life and the \n\n5 functioning domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social) were maintained for patients \n\non sunitinib treatment as compared to placebo with limited adverse symptomatic effects. \n\n \n\nA Phase 4 multinational, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety \n\nof sunitinib was conducted in patients with progressive, advanced/metastatic, well-differentiated, \n\nunresectable pNET. \n\n \n\nOne hundred six patients (61 patients in the treatment-na\u00efve cohort and 45 patients in the later-line \n\ncohort) received treatment with sunitinib orally at 37.5 mg once a day on a continuous daily dosing \n\n(CDD) schedule. \n\n \n\nThe investigator-assessed median PFS was 13.2 months, both in the overall population (95% CI: 10.9, \n\n16.7) and in the treatment-na\u00efve cohort (95% CI: 7.4, 16.8). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nExperience on the use of sunitinib in paediatric patients is limited (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nA Phase 1 dose-escalation study of oral sunitinib was conducted in 35 patients comprised of \n\n30 paediatric patients (aged 3 years to 17 years) and 5 young adult patients (aged: 18 years to \n\n21 years), with refractory solid tumours, the majority of whom were enrolled with a primary diagnosis \n\nof brain tumour. Dose-limiting cardiotoxicity was observed in the first part of the study which was \n\ntherefore amended to exclude patients with previous exposure to potentially cardiotoxic therapies \n\n(including anthracyclines) or cardiac radiation. In the second part of the study, including patients with \n\nprior anticancer therapy but without risk factors for cardiac toxicity, sunitinib was generally tolerable \n\nand clinically manageable at the dose of 15 mg/m2 daily (MTD) on Schedule 4/2. None of the subjects \n\nachieved complete response or partial response. Stable disease was observed in 6 patients (17%). One \n\npatient with GIST was enrolled at the 15 mg/m2 dose level with no evidence of benefit. The observed \n\nadverse drug reactions were similar overall to those seen in adults (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nA Phase 2 open-label study was conducted in 29 patients comprised of 27 paediatric patients (aged \n\n3 years to 16 years) and 2 young adult patients (aged 18 years to 19 years) with HGG or ependymoma. \n\nThe study was closed at the time of planned interim analysis due to the lack of disease control. Median \n\nPFS was 2.3 months in the HGG group and 2.7 months in the ependymoma group. Median overall OS \n\nwas 5.1 months in the HGG group and 12.3 months in the ependymoma group. The most common \n\n(\u226510%) reported treatment-related adverse events in patients in both groups combined were neutrophil \n\ncount decreased (6 patients [20.7%]) and haemorrhage intracranial (3 patients [10.3%]) (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\nEvidence from a Phase 1/2 study of oral sunitinib conducted in 6 paediatric patients with GIST aged \n\n13 years to 16 years who received sunitinib on Schedule 4/2, at doses ranging between 15 mg/m2 daily \n\nand 30 mg/m2 daily, and available published data (20 paediatric or young adult patients with GIST) \n\nindicated that sunitinib treatment resulted in disease stabilization in 18 of 26 (69.2%) patients, either \n\nafter imatinib failure or intolerance (16 patients with stable disease out of 21), or de novo/after surgery \n\n(2 patients with stable disease out of 5). In the Phase 1/2 study, stable disease and disease progression \n\nwas observed in 3 out of 6 patients each (1 patient received neo adjuvant and 1 patient received \n\nadjuvant imatinib, respectively). In the same study, 4 out of 6 patients (66.7%) experienced Grade 3-4 \n\ntreatment-related adverse events (Grade 3 hypophosphataemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in \n\n1 patient each and a Grade 4 neutropenia in 1 patient). In addition, the publications reported the \n\nfollowing Grade 3 adverse drug reactions experienced by 5 patients: fatigue (2), gastrointestinal \n\nadverse drug reactions (including diarrhoea) (2), haematologic adverse drug reactions (including \n\nanaemia) (2), cholecystitis (1), hyperthyroidism (1), and mucositis (1). \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis was \n\nconducted with the scope to extrapolate the PK and key safety and efficacy endpoints of sunitinib in \n\npaediatric patients with GIST (aged: 6 years to 17 years). This analysis was based on data collected \n\nfrom adults with GIST or solid tumours and from paediatric patients with solid tumours. Based on the \n\nmodelling analyses, the younger age and lower body size did not appear to affect negatively the safety \n\nand efficacy responses to sunitinib plasma exposures. Sunitinib benefit/risk did not appear to be \n\nnegatively affected by younger age or lower body size, and was mainly driven by its plasma exposure.  \n\n \n\nThe EMA has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Sutent in all subsets of the \n\npaediatric population for the treatment of kidney or renal pelvis carcinoma (excluding \n\nnephroblastoma, nephroblastomatosis, clear cell sarcoma, mesoblastic nephroma, renal medullary \n\ncarcinoma, and rhabdoid tumour of the kidney) (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe EMA has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with Sutent in all subsets of \n\nthe paediatric population for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours \n\n(excluding neuroblastoma, neuroganglioblastoma, and phaeochromocytoma) (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe PK of sunitinib were evaluated in 135 healthy volunteers and 266 patients with solid tumours. The \n\nPK were similar in all solid tumours populations tested and in healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIn the dosing ranges of 25 to 100 mg, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and \n\nCmax increase proportionally with dose. With repeated daily administration, sunitinib accumulates 3- to \n\n4-fold and its primary active metabolite accumulates 7- to 10-fold. Steady-state concentrations of \n\nsunitinib and its primary active metabolite are achieved within 10 to 14 days. By Day 14, combined \n\nplasma concentrations of sunitinib and its active metabolite are 62.9-101 ng/ml, which are target \n\nconcentrations predicted from preclinical data to inhibit receptor phosphorylation in vitro and result in \n\ntumour stasis/growth reduction in vivo. The primary active metabolite comprises 23% to 37% of the \n\ntotal exposure. No significant changes in the PK of sunitinib or the primary active metabolite are \n\nobserved with repeated daily administration or with repeated cycles in the dosing schedules tested. \n\n \n\nAbsorption  \n\nAfter oral administration of sunitinib, Cmax are generally observed from 6 to 12 hours time to \n\nmaximum concentration (tmax) postadministration.  \n\n \n\nFood has no effect on the bioavailability of sunitinib. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nIn vitro, binding of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite to human plasma protein was 95% and \n\n90%, respectively, with no apparent concentration dependence. The apparent volume of distribution \n\n(Vd) for sunitinib was large, 2230 L, indicating distribution into the tissues. \n\n \n\nMetabolic interactions \n\nThe calculated in vitro Ki values for all cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, and CYP4A9/11) indicated \n\nthat sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are unlikely to induce metabolism, to any clinically \n\nrelevant extent, of other actives substances that may be metabolised by these enzymes. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nSunitinib is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4, the CYP isoform which produces its primary active \n\nmetabolite, desethyl sunitinib, which is then further metabolised by the same isoenzyme. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors should be avoided because \n\nthe plasma levels of sunitinib may be altered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nExcretion is primarily via faeces (61%), with renal elimination of unchanged active substance and \n\nmetabolites accounting for 16% of the administered dose. Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite \n\nwere the major compounds identified in plasma, urine, and faeces, representing 91.5%, 86.4%, and \n\n73.8% of radioactivity in pooled samples, respectively. Minor metabolites were identified in urine and \n\nfaeces, but generally were not found in plasma. Total oral clearance (CL/F) was 34-62 L/h. Following \n\noral administration in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-lives of sunitinib and its primary active \n\ndesethyl metabolite are approximately 40-60 hours and 80-110 hours, respectively. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with medicinal products that are BCRP inhibitors \n\nIn vitro, sunitinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP. In study A6181038 the \n\nco-administration of gefitinib, a BCRP inhibitor, did not result in a clinically relevant effect on the \n\nCmax and AUC for sunitinib or total drug (sunitinib + metabolite) (see section 4.5). This study was a \n\nmulti-centre, open-label, Phase 1/2 study examining the safety/tolerability, the maximum tolerated \n\ndose, and the antitumour activity of sunitinib in combination with gefitinib in subjects with MRCC. \n\nThe PK of gefitinib (250 mg daily) and sunitinib (37.5 mg [Cohort 1, n=4] or 50 mg [Cohort 2, n=7] \n\ndaily on a 4-weeks on followed by 2 weeks-off schedule) when co-administered was evaluated as a \n\nsecondary study objective. Changes in sunitinib PK parameters were of no clinical significance and \ndid not indicate any drug-drug interactions; however, considering the relatively low number of \n\nsubjects (i.e. N=7+4) and the moderate-large interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters, caution needs to be taken when interpreting the PK drug-drug interaction findings from \n\nthis study. \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nSunitinib and its primary metabolite are mainly metabolised by the liver. Systemic exposures after a \n\nsingle dose of sunitinib were similar in subjects with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) \n\nhepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Sutent was not studied in \n\nsubjects with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nStudies in cancer patients have excluded patients with ALT or AST > 2.5 x ULN (upper limit of \n\nnormal) or > 5.0 x ULN if due to liver metastasis.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nPopulation PK analyses indicated that sunitinib apparent clearance (CL/F) was not affected by \n\ncreatinine clearance (CLcr) within the range evaluated (42-347 ml/min). Systemic exposures after a \n\nsingle dose of sunitinib were similar in subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min) \n\ncompared to subjects with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 ml/min). Although sunitinib and its \n\nprimary metabolite were not eliminated through haemodialysis in subjects with ESRD, the total \n\nsystemic exposures were lower by 47% for sunitinib and 31% for its primary metabolite compared to \n\nsubjects with normal renal function. \n\n \n\nWeight, performance status \n\nPopulation PK analyses of demographic data indicate that no starting dose adjustments are necessary \n\nfor weight or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nAvailable data indicate that females could have about 30% lower apparent clearance (CL/F) of \n\nsunitinib than males: this difference, however, does not necessitate starting dose adjustments. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nExperience on the use of sunitinib in paediatric patients is limited (see section 4.2). Population PK \n\nanalyses of a pooled dataset from adult patients with GIST and solid tumours and paediatric patients \n\nwith solid tumours were completed. Stepwise covariate modelling analyses were performed to \n\nevaluate the effect of age and body size (total body weight or body surface area) as well as other \n\ncovariates on important PK parameters for sunitinib and its active metabolite. Among age and \n\nbodysize related covariates tested, age was a significant covariate on apparent clearance of sunitinib \n\n(the younger the age of the paediatric patient, the lower the apparent clearance). Similarly, body \n\nsurface area was a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of the active metabolite (the lower \n\nthe body surface area, the lower the apparent clearance).  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, based on an integrated population PK analysis of pooled data from the 3 paediatric \n\nstudies (2 paediatric solid tumour studies and 1 paediatric GIST study; ages: 6 years to 11 years and \n\n12 years to 17 years), baseline body surface area (BSA) was a significant covariate on apparent \n\nclearance of sunitinib and its active metabolite. Based on this analysis, a dose of approximately \n\n20 mg/m2 daily in paediatric patients, with BSA values between 1.10 and 1.87 m2, is expected to \n\nprovide plasma exposures to sunitinib and its active metabolite comparable (between 75 and 125% of \n\nthe AUC) to those in adults with GIST administered sunitinib 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (AUC \n\n1233 ng.hr/mL). In paediatric studies, the starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 (based on the MTD \n\nidentified in the Phase 1 dose-escalation study, see section 5.1), which in paediatric patients with GIST \n\nincreased to 22.5 mg/m2 and subsequently to 30 mg/m2 (not to exceed the total dose of 50 mg/day) \n\nbased on individual patient safety/tolerability. Furthermore, according to the published literatures in \n\npaediatric patients with GIST, the calculated starting dose ranged from 16.6 mg/m2 to 36 mg/m2, \n\nincreased to doses as high as 40.4 mg/m2 (not exceeding the total dose of 50 mg/day). \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn rat and monkey repeated-dose toxicity studies up to 9-months duration, the primary target organ \n\neffects were identified in the gastrointestinal tract (emesis and diarrhoea in monkeys); adrenal gland \n\n(cortical congestion and/or haemorrhage in rats and monkeys, with necrosis followed by fibrosis in \n\nrats); haemolymphopoietic system (bone morrow hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion of thymus, \n\nspleen, and lymph node); exocrine pancreas (acinar cell degranulation with single cell necrosis); \n\nsalivary gland (acinar hypertrophy); bone joint (growth plate thickening); uterus (atrophy); and ovaries \n\n(decreased follicular development). All findings occurred at clinically relevant sunitinib plasma \n\nexposure levels. Additional effects observed in other studies included: QTc interval prolongation, \n\nLVEF reduction and testicular tubular atrophy, increased mesangial cells in kidney, haemorrhage in \n\ngastrointestinal tract and oral mucosa, and hypertrophy of anterior pituitary cells. Changes in the \n\nuterus (endometrial atrophy) and bone growth plate (physeal thickening or dysplasia of cartilage) are \n\nthought to be related to the pharmacological action of sunitinib. Most of these findings were reversible \n\nafter 2 to 6 weeks without treatment. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity  \n\nThe genotoxic potential of sunitinib was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Sunitinib was not mutagenic in \n\nbacteria using metabolic activation provided by rat liver. Sunitinib did not induce structural \n\nchromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cells in vitro. Polyploidy (numerical \n\nchromosome aberrations) was observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, both in the \n\npresence and absence of metabolic activation. Sunitinib was not clastogenic in rat bone marrow \n\nin vivo. The major active metabolite was not evaluated for genotoxic potential. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\nIn a 1-month, oral gavage dose-range finding study (0, 10, 25, 75, or 200 mg/kg/day) with continuous \n\ndaily dosing in rasH2 transgenic mice, carcinoma and hyperplasia of Brunner\u2019s glands of the \n\nduodenum were observed at the highest dose (200 mg/kg/day) tested. \n\n \n\nA 6-month, oral gavage carcinogenicity study (0, 8, 25, 75 [reduced to 50] mg/kg/day), with daily \n\ndosing was conducted in rasH2 transgenic mice. Gastroduodenal carcinomas, an increased incidence \n\nof background haemangiosarcomas, and/or gastric mucosal hyperplasia were observed at doses \n\nof \u2265 25 mg/kg/day following 1- or 6-months duration (\u2265 7.3 times the AUC in patients administered \n\nthe recommended daily dose \uf05bRDD\uf05d).  \n\n \n\nIn a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study (0, 0.33, 1, or 3 mg/kg/day), administration of sunitinib in 28-day \n\ncycles followed by 7-day dose-free periods resulted in increases in the incidence of \n\nphaeochromocytomas and hyperplasia in the adrenal medulla of male rats given 3 mg/kg/day \n\nfollowing > 1 year of dosing (\u2265 7.8 times the AUC in patients administered the RDD). Brunner\u2019s \n\nglands carcinoma occurred in the duodenum at \u2265 1 mg/kg/day in females and at 3 mg/kg/day in males, \n\nand mucous cell hyperplasia was evident in the glandular stomach at 3 mg/kg/day in males, which \n\noccurred at \u2265 0.9, 7.8, and 7.8 times the AUC in patients administered the RDD, respectively. The \n\nrelevance to humans of the neoplastic findings observed in the mouse (rasH2 transgenic) and rat \n\ncarcinogenicity studies with sunitinib treatment is unclear. \n\n \n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity \n\nNo effects on male or female fertility were observed in reproductive toxicity studies. However, in \n\nrepeated-dose toxicity studies performed in rats and monkeys, effects on female fertility were \n\nobserved in the form of follicular atresia, degeneration of corpora lutea, endometrial changes in the \n\nuterus, and decreased uterine and ovarian weights at clinically relevant systemic exposure levels. \n\nEffects on male fertility in rat were observed in the form of tubular atrophy in the testes, reduction of \n\nspermatozoa in epididymides, and colloid depletion in prostate and seminal vesicles at plasma \n\nexposure levels 25 times the systemic exposure in humans. \n\n \n\nIn rats, embryo-foetal mortality was evident as significant reductions in the number of live foetuses, \n\nincreased numbers of resorptions, increased postimplantation loss, and total litter loss in 8 of \n\n28 pregnant females at plasma exposure levels 5.5 times the systemic exposure in humans. In rabbits, \n\n\n\n27 \n\nreductions in gravid uterine weights and number of live foetuses were due to increases in the number \n\nof resorptions, increases in postimplantation loss and complete litter loss in 4 of 6 pregnant females at \n\nplasma exposure levels 3 times the systemic exposure in humans. Sunitinib treatment in rats during \n\norganogenesis resulted in developmental effects at \uf0b3 5 mg/kg/day consisting of increased incidence of \n\nfoetal skeletal malformations, predominantly characterised as retarded ossification of thoracic/lumbar \n\nvertebrae and occurred at plasma exposure levels 5.5 times the systemic exposure in humans. In \n\nrabbits, developmental effects consisted of increased incidence of cleft lip at plasma exposure levels \n\napproximately equal to that observed in clinic, and cleft lip and cleft palate at plasma exposure levels \n\n2.7 times the systemic exposure in humans. \n\n \n\nSunitinib (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg/day) was evaluated in a pre-and postnatal development study in \n\npregnant rats. Maternal body weight gains were reduced during gestation and lactation at \n\n\u2265 1 mg/kg/day but no maternal reproductive toxicity was observed up to 3 mg/kg/day (estimate \n\nexposure \u2265 2.3 times the AUC in patients administered the RDD). Reduced offspring body weights \n\nwere observed during the preweaning and postweaning periods at 3 mg/kg/day. No development \n\ntoxicity was observed at 1 mg/kg/day (approximate exposure \u2265 0.9 times the AUC in patients \n\nadministered the RDD). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Sutent is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sutent \n\n3. How to take Sutent \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Sutent \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Sutent is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSutent contains the active substance sunitinib, which is a protein kinase inhibitor. It is used to treat \n\ncancer by preventing the activity of a special group of proteins which are known to be involved in the \n\ngrowth and spread of cancer cells. \n\n \n\nSutent is used to treat adults with the following types of cancer:  \n\n \n\n- Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), a type of cancer of the stomach and bowel, where \nimatinib (another anticancer medicine) no longer works or you cannot take imatinib. \n\n- Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC), a type of kidney cancer that has spread to other parts \nof the body. \n\n- Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNET) (tumours of the hormone-producing cells in the \npancreas) that have progressed or cannot be removed with surgery. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Sutent works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sutent \n\n \n\nDo not take Sutent: \n\n \n\n- If you are allergic to sunitinib or any of the other ingredients of Sutent (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Sutent: \n\n \n\n-  If you have high blood pressure. Sutent can raise blood pressure. Your doctor may check your \n\nblood pressure during treatment with Sutent, and you may be treated with medicines to reduce \n\nthe blood pressure, if needed.  \n\n \n\n- If you have or have had blood disease, bleeding problems, or bruising. Treatment with \nSutent may lead to a higher risk of bleeding or lead to changes in the number of certain cells in \n\nthe blood which may lead to anaemia or affect the ability of your blood to clot. If you are taking \n\nwarfarin or acenocoumarole, medicines which thin the blood to prevent blood clots, there may \n\nbe a greater risk of bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding while on treatment with \n\nSutent.  \n\n \n\n- If you have heart problems. Sutent can cause heart problems.
