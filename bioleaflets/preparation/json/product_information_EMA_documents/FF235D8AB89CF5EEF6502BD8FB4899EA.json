CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBrintellix is indicated for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe starting and recommended dose of Brintellix is 10 mg vortioxetine once daily in adults less than \n65 years of age. \n \nDepending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg \nvortioxetine once daily or decreased to a minimum of 5 mg vortioxetine once daily. \n \nAfter the depressive symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is recommended for \nconsolidation of the antidepressive response. \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nPatients treated with vortioxetine can abruptly stop taking the medicinal product without the need for a \ngradual reduction in dose (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nThe lowest effective dose of 5 mg vortioxetine once daily should always be used as the starting dose in \npatients ≥ 65 years of age. Caution is advised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses \nhigher than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily for which data are limited (see section 4.4). \n \nCytochrome P450 inhibitors \nDepending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if a strong \nCYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. bupropion, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) is added to vortioxetine \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n \nCytochrome P450 inducers \nDepending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment of vortioxetine may be considered if a \nbroad cytochrome P450 inducer (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is added to vortioxetine \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed based on renal or hepatic function (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nBrintellix is for oral use. \nThe film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nConcomitant use with nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or selective MAO-A \ninhibitors (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nUse in paediatric population \n \nBrintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since \nthe safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in this age group (see section 4.2). In \nclinical studies in children and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related \nbehaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, \noppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo. \n \nSuicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening \n \nDepression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide \n(suicide-related events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not \noccur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such \nimprovement occurs. It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early \nstages of recovery. \n \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies of antidepressants in adult patients with psychiatric disorders \nshowed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo, in patients \nless than 25 years old. \n \nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany treatment \nespecially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should \nbe alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and \nunusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. \n \nSeizures \n \nSeizures are a potential risk with antidepressants. Therefore, vortioxetine should be introduced \ncautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or in patients with unstable epilepsy (see section \n4.5). Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures or for whom there is an \nincrease in seizure frequency. \n \nSerotonin Syndrome (SS) or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nSerotonin Syndrome (SS) or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), potentially life-threatening \nconditions, may occur with vortioxetine. The risk of SS or NMS is increased with concomitant use of \nserotonergic-active substances (including triptans), medicinal products that impair the metabolism of \nserotonin (including MAOIs), antipsychotics, and other dopamine antagonists. Patients should be \nmonitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of SS or NMS (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nSerotonin Syndrome symptoms include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), \nautonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \naberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, uncoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea). If this occurs, treatment with vortioxetine should be discontinued immediately \nand symptomatic treatment should be initiated. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMania/hypomania \n \nVortioxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania/hypomania and should be \ndiscontinued in any patient entering a manic phase. \n \nAggression/agitation \n\nPatients treated with antidepressants, including vortioxetine, may also experience feelings of \naggression, anger, agitation and irritability. Patient’s condition and disease status should be closely \nmonitored. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted to seek medical advice, if \naggressive/agitated behaviour emerges or aggravates. \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nBleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and other haemorrhagic events, such as \ngastrointestinal or gynaecological bleeding, have been reported rarely with the use of antidepressants \nwith serotonergic effect, including vortioxetine. Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants \nand/or medicinal products known to affect platelet function [e.g., atypical antipsychotics and \nphenothiazines, most tricyclic antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nacetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] (see section 4.5) and in patients with known bleeding tendencies/disorders. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia, probably due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), has been \nreported rarely with the use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect (SSRIs, SNRIs). Caution \nshould be exercised in patients at risk, such as the elderly, patients with cirrhosis of the liver or \npatients concomitantly treated with medicinal products known to cause hyponatraemia. \nDiscontinuation of vortioxetine should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatraemia and \nappropriate medical intervention should be instituted. \n \nGlaucoma \n \nMydriasis has been reported in association with use of antidepressants, including vortioxetine. This \nmydriatic effect has the potential to narrow the eye angle resulting in increased intraocular pressure \nand angle-closure glaucoma. Caution is advised when prescribing vortioxetine to patients with \nincreased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nElderly \n \nData on the use of Brintellix in elderly patients with major depressive episodes are limited. Therefore, \ncaution should be exercised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses higher than 10 mg \nvortioxetine once daily (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nGiven that subjects with renal or hepatic impairment are vulnerable and given that the data on the use \nof Brintellix in these subpopulations are limited, caution should be exercised when treating these \npatients. (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nBrintellix contains Sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nVortioxetine is extensively metabolised in the liver, primarily through oxidation catalysed by CYP2D6 \nand to a minor extent CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 (see section 5.2). \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect vortioxetine \n \nIrreversible non-selective MAOIs \nDue to the risk of serotonin syndrome, vortioxetine is contraindicated in any combination with \nirreversible non-selective MAOIs. Vortioxetine must not be initiated for at least 14 days after \ndiscontinuation of treatment with an irreversible non-selective MAOI. Vortioxetine must be \ndiscontinued for at least 14 days before starting treatment with an irreversible non-selective MAOI \n(see section 4.3). \n \nReversible, selective MAO-A inhibitor (moclobemide) \nThe combination of vortioxetine with a reversible and selective MAO-A inhibitor, such as \nmoclobemide, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). If the combination proves necessary, the added \nmedicinal product should be given with minimum dosage and under close clinical monitoring for \nserotonin sSyndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nReversible, non-selective MAOI (linezolid) \nThe combination of vortioxetine with a weak reversible and non-selective MAOI, such as the \nantibiotic linezolid, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). If the combination proves necessary, the added \nmedicinal product should be given with minimum dosage and under close clinical monitoring for \nserotonin syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nIrreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor (selegiline, rasagiline) \nAlthough a lower risk of serotonin syndrome is expected with selective MAO-B inhibitors than with \nMAO-A inhibitors, the combination of vortioxetine with irreversible MAO-B inhibitors, such as \nselegiline or rasagiline should be administered with caution. Close monitoring for serotonin syndrome \nis necessary if used concomitantly (see section 4.4). \n \nSerotonergic medicinal products \nCo-administration of medicinal products with serotonergic effect (e.g., tramadol, sumatriptan and \nother triptans) may lead to serotonin syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nSt. John’s wort \nConcomitant use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect and herbal remedies containing St. John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum) may result in a higher incidence of adverse reactions including \nSerotonin Syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products lowering the seizure threshold \nAntidepressants with serotonergic effect can lower the seizure threshold. Caution is advised when \nconcomitantly using other medicinal products capable of lowering the seizure threshold [e.g., \nantidepressants (tricyclics, SSRIs, SNRIs), neuroleptics (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes and \nbutyrophenones), mefloquine, bupropion, tramadol] (see section 4.4). \n \nECT (electroconvulsive therapy) \nThere is no clinical experience with concurrent administration of vortioxetine and ECT, therefore \ncaution is advisable. \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nThe exposure to vortioxetine increased 2.3-fold for area under the curve (AUC) when vortioxetine \n10 mg/day was co-administered with bupropion (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor 150 mg twice daily) for \n14 days in healthy subjects. Co-administration resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions \nwhen bupropion was added to vortioxetine than when vortioxetine was added to bupropion. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nDepending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if strong \nCYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., bupropion, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) is added to vortioxetine \ntreatment (see section 4.2). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 inhibitors \nWhen vortioxetine was co-administered following 6 days of ketoconazole 400 mg/day (a CYP3A4/5 \nand P-glycoprotein inhibitor) or following 6 days of fluconazole 200 mg/day (a CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nand CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) in healthy subjects, a 1.3-fold and 1.5-fold increase, respectively, in \nvortioxetine AUC was observed. No dose adjustment is needed. \n \nNo inhibitory effect of 40 mg single-dose omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor) was observed on the \nmultiple-dose pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in healthy subjects. \n \nInteractions in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nCo-administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (such as itraconazol, voriconazole, clarithromycin, \ntelithromycin, nefazodone, conivaptan and many of the HIV protease inhibitors) and inhibitors of \nCYP2C9 (such as fluconazole and amiodarone) to CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (see section 5.2) has \nnot been investigated specifically, but it is anticipated that it will lead to a more marked increased \nexposure of vortioxetine in these patients as compared to the moderate effect described above. \nDepending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if a strong \ninhibitor of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 is co-administered in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. \n \nCytochrome P450 inducers \nWhen a single dose of 20 mg vortioxetine was co-administered following 10 days of rifampicin \n600 mg/day (a broad inducer of CYP isozymes) in healthy subjects, a 72% decrease in AUC of \nvortioxetine was observed. Depending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment may be \nconsidered if a broad cytochrome P450 inducer (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is added \nto vortioxetine treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nAlcohol \nNo effect on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine or ethanol and no significant impairment, relative to \nplacebo, in cognitive function were observed when vortioxetine in a single dose of 20 mg or 40 mg \nwas co-administered with a single dose of ethanol (0.6 g/kg) in healthy subjects. However, alcohol \nintake is not advisable during antidepressant treatment. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid \nNo effect of multiple doses of acetylsalicylic acid 150 mg/day on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics \nof vortioxetine was observed in healthy subjects. \n \nPotential for vortioxetine to affect other medicinal products \n \nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet medicinal products \nNo significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in INR, prothrombin or plasma \nR-/S-warfarin values following co-administration of multiple doses of vortioxetine with stable doses \nof warfarin in healthy subjects. Also, no significant inhibitory effect, relative to placebo, on platelet \naggregation or pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid or salicylic acid was observed when \nacetylsalicylic acid 150 mg/day was co-administered following multiple doses of vortioxetine \nadministration in healthy subjects. However, caution should be exercised when vortioxetine is \ncombined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet medicinal products due to a potential increased risk \nof bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction (see section 4.4). \n \nCytochrome P450 substrates \nIn vitro, vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for inhibition or induction of \ncytochrome P450 isozymes (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFollowing multiple doses of vortioxetine, no inhibitory effect was observed in healthy subjects for the \ncytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C19 (omeprazole, diazepam), CYP3A4/5 (ethinyl estradiol, \nmidazolam), CYP2B6 (bupropion), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide, S-warfarin), CYP1A2 (caffeine) or \nCYP2D6 (dextromethorphan). \n \nNo pharmacodynamic interactions were observed. No significant impairment, relative to placebo, in \ncognitive function was observed for vortioxetine following co-administration with a single 10 mg dose \nof diazepam. No significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in the levels of sex hormones \nfollowing co-administration of vortioxetine with a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol \n30 µg/ levonorgestrel 150 µg). \n \nLithium, tryptophan \nNo clinically relevant effect was observed during steady-state lithium exposure following co-\nadministration with multiple doses of vortioxetine in healthy subjects. However, there have been \nreports of enhanced effects when antidepressants with serotonergic effect have been given together \nwith lithium or tryptophan; therefore, concomitant use of vortioxetine with these medicinal products \nshould be undertaken with caution. \n \nInterference with urine drug screens \nThere have been reports of false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone in \npatients who have taken vortioxetine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive \nurine drug screen results, and confirmation by an alternative analytical technique (e.g., \nchromatographic methods) should be considered. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of vortioxetine in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe following symptoms may occur in the newborn after maternal use of a serotonergic medicinal \nproduct in the later stages of pregnancy: respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnoea, seizures, temperature \ninstability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, hypertonia, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, \njitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, somnolence and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms \ncould be due to either discontinuation effects or excess serotonergic activity. In the majority of \ninstances, such complications began immediately or soon (<24 hours) after delivery. \n \nEpidemiological data suggest that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy, may \nincrease the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). Although no studies \nhave investigated the association of PPHN with vortioxetine treatment, this potential risk cannot be \nruled out taking into account the related mechanism of action (increase in serotonin concentrations). \n \nBrintellix should only be administered to pregnant women if the expected benefits outweigh the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAvailable data in animals have shown excretion of vortioxetine/ vortioxetine metabolites in milk. It is \nexpected that vortioxetine will be excreted into human milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to the breastfeeding child cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nBrintellix treatment taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nFertility \n \nFertility studies in male and female rats showed no effect of vortioxetine on fertility, sperm quality or \nmating performance (see section 5.3). \nHuman case reports with medicinal products from the related pharmacological class of antidepressants \n(SSRIs) have shown an effect on sperm quality that is reversible. Impact on human fertility has not \nbeen observed so far. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBrintellix has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, as adverse \nreactions such as dizziness have been reported, patients should exercise caution when driving or \noperating hazardous machinery, especially when starting treatment with vortioxetine or when \nchanging the dose. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction was nausea.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  The list is based on \ninformation from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION \nImmune system disorders  Not known* Anaphylactic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Not known * Hyponatraemia \nPsychiatric disorders Common Abnormal dreams \n\nNot known * Insomnia \nNot known * Agitation, aggression (see section 4.4) \n\nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \nNot known * Serotonin Syndrome  \n\nEye disorders Rare  Mydriasis (which may lead to acute \nnarrow angle glaucoma - see section \n4.4) \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon Flushing \nNot known* Haemorrhage (including contusion, \n\necchymosis, epistaxis, gastrointestinal \nor vaginal bleeding) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea \nCommon Diarrhoea, \n\nConstipation, \nVomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common Pruritus, including pruritus \ngeneralised \n\nUncommon Night sweats \nNot known* Angioedema, \n\nUrticaria \nRash \n\n* Based on post-marketing cases \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nNausea \nNausea was usually mild or moderate and occurred within the first two weeks of treatment. The \nreactions were usually transient and did not generally lead to cessation of therapy. Gastrointestinal \nadverse reactions, such as nausea, occurred more frequently in women than men. \n \nElderly patients \nFor doses ≥10 mg vortioxetine once daily, the withdrawal rate from the studies was higher in patients \naged ≥65 years. \nFor doses of 20 mg vortioxetine once daily, the incidences of nausea and constipation were higher in \npatients aged ≥65 years (42% and 15%, respectively) than in patients aged <65 years (27% and 4%, \nrespectively)(see section 4.4). \n \nSexual dysfunction \nIn clinical studies, sexual dysfunction was assessed using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale \n(ASEX). Doses of 5 to 15 mg showed no difference to placebo. However, the 20 mg dose of \nvortioxetine was associated with an increase in sexual dysfunction (TESD)(see section 5.1) . \n \nClass effect \nEpidemiological studies, mainly conducted in patients 50 years of age and older, show an increased \nrisk of bone fractures in patients receiving a medicinal product from related pharmacological classes \nof antidepressants (SSRIs or TCAs). The mechanism behind this risk is unknown, and it is not known \nif this risk is also relevant for vortioxetine. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIngestion of vortioxetine in clinical trials in the dose range of 40 mg to 75 mg has caused an \naggravation of the following adverse reactions: nausea, postural dizziness, diarrhoea, abdominal \ndiscomfort, generalised pruritus, somnolence and flushing. \n \nPost-marketing experience mainly concerns vortioxetine overdoses of up to 80 mg. In the majority of \ncases, no symptoms or mild symptoms were reported. The most frequently reported symptoms were \nnausea and vomiting.  \n \nThere is limited experience with vortioxetine overdoses above 80 mg. Following dosages several fold \nhigher than the therapeutic dose range, events of seizure and serotonin syndrome have been reported. \n \nManagement of overdose should consist of treating clinical symptoms and relevant monitoring. \nMedical follow-up in a specialised environment is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other antidepressants, ATC code: N06AX26 \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of vortioxetine is thought to be related to its direct modulation of \nserotonergic receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter. Nonclinical data \nindicate that vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial \nagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter, leading to modulation of \nneurotransmission in several systems, including predominantly the serotonin but probably also the \nnorepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate systems. This multimodal \nactivity is considered responsible for the antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects and the \nimprovement of cognitive function, learning and memory observed with vortioxetine in animal \nstudies. However, the precise contribution of the individual targets to the observed pharmacodynamic \nprofile remains unclear and caution should be applied when extrapolating animal data directly to man.  \n \nIn humans, two positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been conducted using 5-HT \ntransporter ligands (11C-MADAM or 11C-DASB) to quantify the 5-HT transporter occupancy in the \nbrain across different dose levels. The mean 5-HT transporter occupancy in the raphe nuclei was \napproximately 50% at 5 mg/day, 65% at 10 mg/day and increased to above 80% at 20 mg/day.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of vortioxetine have been studied in a clinical programme that included more \nthan 6,700 patients, of whom more than 3,700 were treated with vortioxetine in short-term \n(≤12 weeks) studies of major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve double-blind, placebo controlled, \n6/8-week, fixed-dose studies have been conducted to investigate the short-term efficacy of \nvortioxetine in MDD in adults (including the elderly). The efficacy of vortioxetine was demonstrated \nwith at least one dosage group across 9 of the 12 studies, showing at least a 2-point difference to \nplacebo in the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or Hamilton Depression \nRating Scale 24-item (HAM-D24) total score. This was supported by clinical relevance as \ndemonstrated by the proportions of responders and remitters and the improvement in the Clinical \nGlobal Impression – Global Improvement (CGI-I) score. The efficacy of vortioxetine increased with \nincreasing dose.  \n \nThe effect in the individual studies was supported by the meta-analysis (MMRM) of the mean change \nfrom baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6/8 in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies in \nadults. In the meta-analysis, the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically \nsignificant: -2.3 points (p = 0.007), -3.6 points (p <0.001), and -4.6 points (p <0.001) for the 5, 10, and \n20 mg/day doses, respectively; the 15 mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis, \nbut the mean difference to placebo was -2.6 points. The efficacy of vortioxetine is supported by the \npooled responder analysis, in which the proportion of responders ranged from 46% to 49% for \nvortioxetine versus 34% for placebo (p <0.01; NRI analysis). \n \nFurthermore, vortioxetine, in the dose range of 5-20 mg/day, demonstrated efficacy on the broad range \nof depressive symptoms (assessed by improvement in all MADRS single–item scores).  \n \nThe efficacy of vortioxetine 10 or 20 mg/day was further demonstrated in a 12-week, double-blind, \nflexible-dose comparative study versus agomelatine 25 or 50 mg/day in patients with MDD. \nVortioxetine was statistically significantly better than agomelatine as measured by improvement in the \nMADRS total score and supported by the clinical relevance as demonstrated by the proportions of \nresponders and remitters and improvement in the CGI-I. \n \nMaintenance \nThe maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse-prevention study. Patients \nin remission after an initial 12-week open-label treatment period with vortioxetine were randomised to \nvortioxetine 5 or 10 mg/day or placebo and observed for relapse during a double-blind period of at \nleast 24 weeks (24 to 64 weeks). Vortioxetine was superior (p=0.004) to placebo on the primary \n\n\n\n12 \n\noutcome measure, the time to relapse of MDD, with a hazard ratio of 2.0; that is, the risk of relapse \nwas two times higher in the placebo group than in the vortioxetine group. \n \nElderly \nIn the 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in elderly depressed patients (aged \n≥65 years, n=452, 156 of whom were on vortioxetine), vortioxetine 5 mg/day was superior to placebo \nas measured by improvement in the MADRS and HAM-D24 total scores. The effect seen with \nvortioxetine was a 4.7 point difference to placebo in MADRS total score at Week 8 (MMRM \nanalysis). \n \nPatients with severe depression or with depression and high levels of anxiety symptoms \nIn severely depressed patients (baseline MADRS total score ≥30) and in depressed patients with a high \nlevel of anxiety symptoms (baseline HAM-A total score ≥20) vortioxetine also demonstrated efficacy \nin the short-term studies in adults (the overall mean difference to placebo in MADRS total score at \nWeek 6/8 ranged from 2.8 to 7.3 points and from 3.6 to 7.3 points, respectively,(MMRM analysis)). In \nthe dedicated study in elderly, vortioxetine was also effective in these patients. \nThe maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was also demonstrated in this patient population in the \nlong-term relapse prevention study. \n \nEffects of vortioxetine on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the University of California San \nDiego Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) (objective measures) and Perceived Deficits \nQuestionnaire (PDQ) and Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire CPFQ (subjective \nmeasures) scores \nThe efficacy of vortioxetine (5-20 mg/day) in patients with MDD has been investigated in 2 adult and \n1 elderly short-term, placebo-controlled studies. \n \nVortioxetine had a statistically significant effect versus placebo on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test \n(DSST), ranging from Δ = 1.75 (p = 0.019) to 4.26 (p <0.0001) in the 2 studies in adults and Δ = 2.79 \n(p = 0.023) in the study in the elderly. In the meta-analyses (ANCOVA, LOCF) of the mean change \nfrom baseline in DSST number of correct symbols in all 3 studies, vortioxetine separated from placebo \n(p<0.05) with a standardised effect size of 0.35. When adjusting for the change in MADRS the total \nscore in the meta-analysis of the same studies showed that vortioxetine separated from placebo \n(p<0.05) with a standardised effect size of 0.24.  \n \nOne study assessed the effect of vortioxetine on functional capacity using the University of California \nSan Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA). Vortioxetine separated from placebo \nstatistically with results of 8.0 for vortioxetine versus 5.1 points for placebo (p=0.0003). \n \nIn one study, vortioxetine was superior to placebo on subjective measures, evaluated using the \nPerceived Deficits Questionnaire with results of -14.6 for vortioxetine and -10.5 for placebo \n(p=0.002). Vortioxetine did not separate from placebo on subjective measures when evaluated using \nthe Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire with results of -8.1 for vortioxetine versus -6.9 \nfor placebo (p=0.086). \n \nTolerability and safety \nThe safety and tolerability of vortioxetine have been established in short- and long-term studies across \nthe dose range of 5 to 20 mg/day. For information on undesirable effects, see section 4.8. \nVortioxetine did not increase the incidence of insomnia or somnolence relative to placebo. \n \nIn clinical short- and long-term placebo-controlled studies, potential discontinuation symptoms were \nsystematically evaluated after abrupt treatment cessation of vortioxetine. There was no clinically \nrelevant difference to placebo in the incidence or nature of the discontinuation symptoms after either \nshort-term (6-12 weeks) or long-term (24-64 weeks) treatment with vortioxetine. \n \nThe incidence of self-reported adverse sexual reactions was low and similar to placebo in clinical \nshort- and long-term studies with vortioxetine. In studies using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale \n\n\n\n13 \n\n(ASEX), the incidence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) and the ASEX total score \nshowed no clinically relevant difference to placebo in symptoms of sexual dysfunction at the 5 to \n15 mg/day doses of vortioxetine. For the 20 mg/day dose, an increase in TESD was seen compared to \nplacebo (an incidence difference of 14.2%, 95% CI [1.4, 27.0]). \n \nThe effect of vortioxetine on sexual function was further evaluated in an 8-week, double-blind, \nflexible-dose, comparative study (n=424) versus escitalopram in patients treated for at least 6 weeks \nwith an SSRI (citalopram, paroxetine, or sertraline), with a low level of depressive symptoms \n(baseline CGI-S ≤ 3) and TESD induced by the prior SSRI treatment. Vortioxetine 10-20 mg/day had \nstatistically significantly less TESD than escitalopram 10-20 mg/day as measured by change in the \nCSFQ-14 total score (2.2 points, p=0.013) at week 8. The proportion of responders  was not \nsignificantly different in the vortioxetine group (162 (74.7%)) compared with the escitalopram group \n(137 (66.2%)) at week 8  (OR 1.5 p=0.057). The antidepressant effect was maintained in both \ntreatment groups. \n \nVortioxetine had no effect relative to placebo on body weight, heart rate, or blood pressure in clinical \nshort- and long-term studies. \n \nNo clinically significant changes were observed in hepatic or renal assessments in clinical studies.  \n \nVortioxetine has not shown any clinically significant effect on ECG parameters, including the QT, \nQTc, PR and QRS intervals, in patients with MDD. In a thorough QTc study in healthy subjects at \ndoses up to 40 mg daily, no potential for the prolongation of the QTc interval was observed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in major \ndepressive disorder with vortioxetine in children aged less than 7 years (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies in major \ndepressive disorder with vortioxetine in children and adolescents aged 7 to 18 years (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n\nVortioxetine is slowly, but well absorbed after oral administration and the peak plasma concentration \nis reached within 7 to 11 hours. Following multiple dosing of 5, 10, or 20 mg/day, mean Cmax values of \n9 to 33 ng/mL were observed. The absolute bioavailability is 75%. No effect of food on the \npharmacokinetics was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n\nThe mean volume of distribution (Vss) is 2,600 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. \nVortioxetine is highly bound to plasma proteins (98 to 99%) and the binding appears to be \nindependent of vortioxetine plasma concentrations. \n \nBiotransformation \n\nVortioxetine is extensively metabolised in the liver, primarily through oxidation catalysed by CYP2D6 \nand to a minor extent CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9, and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. \n \nNo inhibitory or inducing effect of vortioxetine was observed in the drug-drug interaction studies for \nthe CYP isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, \nor CYP3A4/5 (see section 4.5). Vortioxetine is a poor P-gp substrate and inhibitor. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe major metabolite of vortioxetine is pharmacologically inactive. \n \nElimination \n\nThe mean elimination half-life and oral clearance are 66 hours and 33 L/h, respectively. \nApproximately 2/3 of the inactive vortioxetine metabolites are excreted in the urine and approximately \n1/3 in the faeces. Only negligible amounts of vortioxetine are excreted in the faeces. Steady-state \nplasma concentrations are achieved in approximately 2 weeks. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nThe pharmacokinetics are linear and time independent in the dose range studied (2.5 to 60 mg/day). \n \nIn accordance with the half-life, the accumulation index is 5 to 6 based on AUC0-24h following multiple \ndoses of 5 to 20 mg/day. \n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nIn elderly healthy subjects (aged ≥65 years; n=20), the exposure to vortioxetine increased up to 27% \n(Cmax and AUC) compared to young healthy control subjects (aged ≤45 years) after multiple doses of \n10 mg/day. The lowest effective dose of 5 mg vortioxetine once daily should always be used as the \nstarting dose in patients ≥ 65 years (see section 4.2). However, caution should be exercised when \nprescribing to elderly patients at doses higher than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nFollowing a single dose of 10 mg vortioxetine, renal impairment estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault \nformula (mild, moderate, or severe; n=8 per group) caused modest exposure increases (up to 30%), \ncompared to healthy matched controls. In patients with end-stage renal disease, only a small fraction \nof vortioxetine was lost during dialysis (AUC and Cmax were 13% and 27% lower, respectively; n=8) \nfollowing a single 10 mg dose of vortioxetine. No dose adjustment is needed based on renal function \n(see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics in subjects (N = 6-8) with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh Criteria A, B, or C, respectively) were compared to healthy volunteers. The changes in AUC \nwere less than 10% lower in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, and 10% higher in \nthose with severe hepatic impairment. The changes in Cmax were less than 25% lower in all groups. No \ndose adjustment is needed based on hepatic function (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP2D6 gene types \nThe plasma concentration of vortioxetine was approximately two times higher in CYP2D6 poor \nmetabolisers than in extensive metabolisers. Co-administration of strong CYP3A4/2C9 inhibitors to \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers could potentially result in higher exposure (see section 4.5). \n \nIn CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers, the plasma concentration of vortioxetine 10 mg/day were \nbetween those obtained in extensive metabolisers at 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day. \nDepending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment may be considered (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of vortioxetine in the general toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs was mainly \nassociated with CNS-related clinical signs. These included salivation (rat and dog), pupil dilatation \n(dog), and two incidences of convulsions in dogs in the general toxicity study programme. A no-effect \nlevel for convulsions was established with a corresponding safety margin of 5 considering the \nmaximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. Target organ toxicity was restricted to \nkidneys (rats) and liver (mice and rats). The changes in the kidney in rats (glomerulonephritis, renal \n\n\n\n15 \n\ntubular obstruction, crystalline material in renal tubule) and in the liver of mice and rats \n(hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocyte necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, crystalline material in bile \nducts) were seen at exposures more than 10-fold (mice) and 2-fold (rats) the human exposure at the \nmaximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. These findings were mainly attributed to \nrodent-specific vortioxetine-related crystalline material obstruction of the renal tubules and the bile \nducts, respectively, and considered of low risk to humans. \n \nVortioxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n \nBased on results from conventional 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice or rats, vortioxetine is not \nconsidered to pose a risk of carcinogenicity in humans. \n \nVortioxetine had no effect on rat fertility, mating performance, reproductive organs, or sperm \nmorphology and motility. Vortioxetine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but reproductive toxicity \nin terms of effects on foetal weight and delayed ossification were seen in the rat at exposures more \nthan 10-fold the human exposure at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. \nSimilar effects were seen in the rabbit at sub-therapeutic exposure. \n \nIn a pre- and post-natal study in rats, vortioxetine was associated with increased pup mortality, \nreduced bodyweight gain, and delayed pup development at doses that did not result in maternal \ntoxicity and with associated exposures similar to those achieved in humans following administration \nof vortioxetine 20 mg/day (see section 4.6). \n \nVortioxetine-related material was distributed to the milk of lactating rats (see section 4.6). \nIn juvenile toxicity studies in rats, all vortioxetine treatment-related findings were consistent with \nthose noted in adult animals. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that vortioxetine has the potential to be persistent, \nbioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (risk to fish). However, by recommended patient usage \nvortioxetine is considered to pose negligible risk to the aquatic and terrestrial environment (see section \n6.6). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBrintellix 20 mg/ml oral drops, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains vortioxetine (D,L)-lactate equivalent to 20 mg vortioxetine. \n \nEach drop contains vortioxetine (D,L)-lactate equivalent to 1 mg vortioxetine. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach drop contains 4.25 mg of ethanol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral drops, solution. \n \nClear, nearly colourless to yellowish solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBrintellix is indicated for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe starting and recommended dose of Brintellix is 10 mg vortioxetine once daily in adults less than \n65 years of age. \n \nDepending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg \nvortioxetine once daily or decreased to a minimum of 5 mg vortioxetine once daily. \n \n5 mg corresponding to 5 drops. \n10 mg corresponding to 10 drops. \n15 mg corresponding to 15 drops. \n20 mg corresponding to 20 drops. \n \nAfter the depressive symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is recommended for \nconsolidation of the antidepressive response. \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nPatients treated with vortioxetine can abruptly stop taking the medicinal product without the need for a \ngradual reduction in dose (see section 5.1). \n \n \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nThe lowest effective dose of 5 mg vortioxetine once daily should always be used as the starting dose in \npatients ≥ 65 years of age. Caution is advised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses \nhigher than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily for which data are limited (see section 4.4). \n \nCytochrome P450 inhibitors \nDepending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if a strong \nCYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., bupropion, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) is added to vortioxetine \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n \nCytochrome P450 inducers \nDepending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment of vortioxetine may be considered if a \nbroad cytochrome P450 inducer (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is added to vortioxetine \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed based on renal or hepatic function (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nBrintellix is for oral use. \nThe oral drops can be taken with or without food.  \nThe drops can be mixed with water, juice or other non-alcoholic drinks. \n \nThe bottle must be turned completely upside down. If no drops come out, the bottle can be tapped lightly \nto start the flow. \n \n\n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use with nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or selective MAO-A \ninhibitors (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nUse in paediatric population \n \nBrintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since \nthe safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in this age group (see section 4.2). In \nclinical studies in children and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related \nbehaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, \noppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo. \n\n\n\n21 \n\nSuicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening \n \nDepression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide \n(suicide-related events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not \noccur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such \nimprovement occurs. It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early \nstages of recovery. \n \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies of antidepressants in adult patients with psychiatric disorders \nshowed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo, in patients \nless than 25 years old. \n \nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany treatment \nespecially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should \nbe alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and \nunusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. \n \nSeizures \n \nSeizures are a potential risk with antidepressants. Therefore, vortioxetine should be introduced \ncautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or in patients with unstable epilepsy (see section \n4.5). Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures or for whom there is an \nincrease in seizure frequency. \n \nSerotonin Syndrome (SS) or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nSerotonin Syndrome (SS) or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), potentially life-threatening \nconditions, may occur with vortioxetine. The risk of SS or NMS is increased with concomitant use of \nserotonergic-active substances (including triptans), medicinal products that impair the metabolism of \nserotonin (including MAOIs), antipsychotics, and other dopamine antagonists. Patients should be \nmonitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of SS or NMS (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nSerotonin Syndrome symptoms include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), \nautonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \naberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, uncoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea). If this occurs, treatment with vortioxetine should be discontinued immediately \nand symptomatic treatment should be initiated. \n \nMania/hypomania \n \nVortioxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania/hypomania and should be \ndiscontinued in any patient entering a manic phase. \n \nAggression/agitation \n\nPatients treated with antidepressants, including vortioxetine, may also experience feelings of \naggression, anger, agitation and irritability. Patient’s condition and disease status should be closely \nmonitored. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted to seek medical advice, if \naggressive/agitated behaviour emerges or aggravates. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nBleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and other haemorrhagic events, such as \ngastrointestinal or gynaecological bleeding, have been reported rarely with the use of antidepressants \nwith serotonergic effect, including vortioxetine. Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants \nand/or medicinal products known to affect platelet function [e.g. atypical antipsychotics and \nphenothiazines, most tricyclic antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nacetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] (see section 4.5) and in patients with known bleeding tendencies/disorders. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia, probably due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), has been \nreported rarely with the use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect (SSRIs, SNRIs). Caution \nshould be exercised in patients at risk, such as the elderly, patients with cirrhosis of the liver or \npatients concomitantly treated with medicinal products known to cause hyponatraemia. \nDiscontinuation of vortioxetine should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatraemia and \nappropriate medical intervention should be instituted. \n \nGlaucoma \n \nMydriasis has been reported in association with use of antidepressants, including vortioxetine. This \nmydriatic effect has the potential to narrow the eye angle resulting in increased intraocular pressure \nand angle-closure glaucoma. Caution is advised when prescribing vortioxetine to patients with \nincreased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nElderly \n \nData on the use of Brintellix in elderly patients with major depressive episodes are limited. Therefore,  \ncaution should be exercised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses higher than 10 mg \nvortioxetine once daily (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nGiven that subjects with renal or hepatic impairment are vulnerable and given that the data on the use \nof Brintellix in these subpopulations are limited, caution should be exercised when treating these \npatients. (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n Excipient contents \nThis medicinal product contains 85 mg of alcohol (ethanol 96%) in each ml which is equivalent to \n10.1 % v/v.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nVortioxetine is extensively metabolised in the liver, primarily through oxidation catalysed by CYP2D6 \nand to a minor extent CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 (see section 5.2). \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect vortioxetine \n \nIrreversible non-selective MAOIs \nDue to the risk of Serotonin Syndrome, vortioxetine is contraindicated in any combination with \nirreversible non-selective MAOIs. Vortioxetine must not be initiated for at least 14 days after \ndiscontinuation of treatment with an irreversible non-selective MAOI. Vortioxetine must be \ndiscontinued for at least 14 days before starting treatment with an irreversible non-selective MAOI \n(see section 4.3). \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nReversible, selective MAO-A inhibitor (moclobemide) \nThe combination of vortioxetine with a reversible and selective MAO-A inhibitor, such as \nmoclobemide, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). If the combination proves necessary, the added \nmedicinal product should be given with minimum dosage and under close clinical monitoring for \nSerotonin Syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nReversible, non-selective MAOI (linezolid) \nThe combination of vortioxetine with a weak reversible and non-selective MAOI, such as the \nantibiotic linezolid, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). If the combination proves necessary, the added \nmedicinal product should be given with minimum dosage and under close clinical monitoring for \nSerotonin Syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nIrreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor (selegiline, rasagiline) \nAlthough a lower risk of Serotonin Syndrome is expected with selective MAO-B inhibitors than with \nMAO-A inhibitors, the combination of vortioxetine with irreversible MAO-B inhibitors, such as \nselegiline or rasagiline should be administered with caution. Close monitoring for Serotonin Syndrome \nis necessary if used concomitantly (see section 4.4). \n \nSerotonergic medicinal products \nCo-administration of medicinal products with serotonergic effect (e.g., tramadol, sumatriptan and \nother triptans) may lead to Serotonin Syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nSt. John’s wort \nConcomitant use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect and herbal remedies containing St. John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum) may result in a higher incidence of adverse reactions including \nSerotonin Syndrome (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products lowering the seizure threshold \nAntidepressants with serotonergic effect can lower the seizure threshold. Caution is advised when \nconcomitantly using other medicinal products capable of lowering the seizure threshold [e.g. \nantidepressants (tricyclics, SSRIs, SNRIs), neuroleptics (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes and \nbutyrophenones), mefloquine, bupropion, tramadol] (see section 4.4). \n \nECT (electroconvulsive therapy) \nThere is no clinical experience with concurrent administration of vortioxetine and ECT, therefore \ncaution is advisable. \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nThe exposure to vortioxetine increased 2.3-fold for area under the curve (AUC) when vortioxetine \n10 mg/day was co-administered with bupropion (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor 150 mg twice daily) for \n14 days in healthy subjects. Co-administration resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions \nwhen bupropion was added to vortioxetine than when vortioxetine was added to bupropion. \nDepending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if a strong \nCYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., bupropion, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) is added to vortioxetine \ntreatment (see section 4.2). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 inhibitors \nWhen vortioxetine was co-administered following 6 days of ketoconazole 400 mg/day (a CYP3A4/5 \nand P-glycoprotein inhibitor) or following 6 days of fluconazole 200 mg/day (a CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nand CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) in healthy subjects, a 1.3-fold and 1.5-fold increase, respectively, in \nvortioxetine AUC was observed. No dose adjustment is needed. \n \nNo inhibitory effect of 40 mg single-dose omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor) was observed on the \nmultiple-dose pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in healthy subjects. \n \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nInteractions in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nCo-administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (such as itraconazol, voriconazole, clarithromycin, \ntelithromycin, nefazodone, conivaptan and many of the HIV protease inhibitors) and inhibitors of \nCYP2C9 (such as fluconazole and amiodarone) to CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (see section 5.2) has \nnot been investigated specifically, but it is anticipated that it will lead to a more marked increased \nexposure of vortioxetine in these patients as compared to the moderate effect described above. \nDepending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if a strong \ninhibitor of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 is co-administered in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. \n \nCytochrome P450 inducers \nWhen a single dose of 20 mg vortioxetine was co-administered following 10 days of rifampicin \n600 mg/day (a broad inducer of CYP isozymes) in healthy subjects, a 72% decrease in AUC of \nvortioxetine was observed. Depending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment may be \nconsidered if a broad cytochrome P450 inducer (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is added \nto vortioxetine treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nAlcohol \nNo effect on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine or ethanol and no significant impairment, relative to \nplacebo, in cognitive function were observed when vortioxetine in a single dose of 20 mg or 40 mg \nwas co-administered with a single dose of ethanol (0.6 g/kg) in healthy subjects. However, alcohol \nintake is not advisable during antidepressant treatment. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid \nNo effect of multiple doses of acetylsalicylic acid 150 mg/day on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics \nof vortioxetine was observed in healthy subjects. \n \nPotential for vortioxetine to affect other medicinal products \n \nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet medicinal products \nNo significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in INR, prothrombin or plasma \nR-/S-warfarin values following co-administration of multiple doses of vortioxetine with stable doses \nof warfarin in healthy subjects. Also, no significant inhibitory effect, relative to placebo, on platelet \naggregation or pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid or salicylic acid was observed when \nacetylsalicylic acid 150 mg/day was co-administered following multiple doses of vortioxetine \nadministration in healthy subjects. However, caution should be exercised when vortioxetine is \ncombined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet medicinal products due to a potential increased risk \nof bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction (see section 4.4). \n \nCytochrome P450 substrates \nIn vitro, vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for inhibition or induction of cytochrome \nP450 isozymes (see section 5.2). \n \nFollowing multiple doses of vortioxetine, no inhibitory effect was observed in healthy subjects for the \ncytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C19 (omeprazole, diazepam), CYP3A4/5 (ethinyl estradiol, \nmidazolam), CYP2B6 (bupropion), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide, S-warfarin), CYP1A2 (caffeine) or \nCYP2D6 (dextromethorphan). \n \nNo pharmacodynamic interactions were observed. No significant impairment, relative to placebo, in \ncognitive function was observed for vortioxetine following co-administration with a single 10 mg dose \nof diazepam. No significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in the levels of sex hormones \nfollowing co-administration of vortioxetine with a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol \n30 µg/ levonorgestrel 150 µg). \n \nLithium, tryptophan \nNo clinically relevant effect was observed during steady-state lithium exposure following co-\nadministration with multiple doses of vortioxetine in healthy subjects. However, there have been \n\n\n\n25 \n\nreports of enhanced effects when antidepressants with serotonergic effect have been given together \nwith lithium or tryptophan; therefore, concomitant use of vortioxetine with these medicinal products \nshould be undertaken with caution. \n \nInterference with urine drug screens \nThere have been reports of false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone in \npatients who have taken vortioxetine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive \nurine drug screen results, and confirmation by an alternative analytical technique (e.g., \nchromatographic methods) should be considered. \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of vortioxetine in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe following symptoms may occur in the newborn after maternal use of a serotonergic medicinal \nproduct in the later stages of pregnancy: respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnoea, seizures, temperature \ninstability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, hypertonia, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, \njitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, somnolence and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms \ncould be due to either discontinuation effects or excess serotonergic activity. In the majority of \ninstances, such complications began immediately or soon (<24 hours) after delivery. \n \nEpidemiological data suggest that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy, may \nincrease the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). Although no studies \nhave investigated the association of PPHN with vortioxetine treatment, this potential risk cannot be \nruled out taking into account the related mechanism of action (increase in serotonin concentrations). \n \nBrintellix should only be administered to pregnant women if the expected benefits outweigh the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAvailable data in animals have shown excretion of vortioxetine/ vortioxetine metabolites in milk. It is \nexpected that vortioxetine will be excreted into human milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to the breastfeeding child cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nBrintellix treatment taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nFertility studies in male and female rats showed no effect of vortioxetine on fertility, sperm quality or \nmating performance (see section 5.3). \nHuman case reports with medicinal products from the related pharmacological class of antidepressants \n(SSRIs) have shown an effect on sperm quality that is reversible. Impact on human fertility has not \nbeen observed so far. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBrintellix has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, as adverse \nreactions such as diziness have been reported, patients should exercise caution when driving or \n\n\n\n26 \n\noperating hazardous machinery, especially when starting treatment with vortioxetine or when \nchanging the dose. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction was nausea.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). The list is based on information \nfrom clinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION \nImmune system disorders  Not known * Anaphylactic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Not known * Hyponatraemia \nPsychiatric disorders Common Abnormal dreams \n\nNot known * Insomnia \nNot known * Agitation, aggression (see section 4.4) \n\nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \nNot known * Serotonin Syndrome  \n\nEye disorders Rare  Mydriasis (which may lead to acute \nnarrow angle glaucoma - see section \n4.4) \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon Flushing \nNot known * Haemorrhage (including contusion, \n\necchymosis, epistaxis, gastrointestinal \nor vaginal bleeding) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea \nCommon Diarrhoea, \n\nConstipation, \nVomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common Pruritus, including  pruritus generalised \nUncommon Night sweats \nNot known* Angioedema, \n\nUrticaria \nRash \n\n* Based on post-marketing cases \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nNausea \nNausea was usually mild or moderate and occurred within the first two weeks of treatment. The \nreactions were usually transient and did not generally lead to cessation of therapy. Gastrointestinal \nadverse reactions, such as nausea, occurred more frequently in women than men. \n \nElderly patients \nFor doses ≥10 mg vortioxetine once daily, the withdrawal rate from the studies was higher in patients \naged ≥65 years. \nFor doses of 20 mg vortioxetine once daily, the incidences of nausea and constipation were higher in \npatients aged ≥65 years (42% and 15%, respectively) than in patients aged <65 years (27% and 4%, \nrespectively)(see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n27 \n\nSexual dysfunction \nIn clinical studies, sexual dysfunction was assessed using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale \n(ASEX). Doses of 5 to 15 mg showed no difference to placebo. However, the 20 mg dose of \nvortioxetine was associated with an increase in  sexual dysfunction (TESD)(see section 5.1) . \n \nClass effect \nEpidemiological studies, mainly conducted in patients 50 years of age and older, show an increased \nrisk of bone fractures in patients receiving a medicinal productfrom related pharmacological classes of \nantidepressants (SSRIs or TCAs). The mechanism behind this risk is unknown, and it is not known if \nthis risk is also relevant for vortioxetine. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIngestion of vortioxetine in clinical trials in the dose range of 40 mg to 75 mg has caused an \naggravation of the following adverse reactions: nausea, postural dizziness, diarrhoea, abdominal \ndiscomfort, generalised pruritus, somnolence and flushing. \n \nPost-marketing experience mainly concerns vortioxetine overdoses of up to 80 mg. In the majority of \ncases, no symptoms or mild symptoms were reported. The most frequently reported symptoms were \nnausea and vomiting.  \n \nThere is limited experience with vortioxetine overdoses above 80 mg. Following dosages several fold \nhigher than the therapeutic dose range, events of seizure and serotonin syndrome have been reported. \n \nManagement of overdose should consist of treating clinical symptoms and relevant monitoring. \nMedical follow-up in a specialised environment is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other antidepressants, ATC-code: N06AX26 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of vortioxetine is thought to be related to its direct modulation of \nserotonergic receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter. Nonclinical data \nindicate that vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial \nagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter, leading to modulation of \nneurotransmission in several systems, including predominantly the serotonin but probably also the \nnorepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate systems. This multimodal \nactivity is considered responsible for the antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects and the \nimprovement of cognitive function, learning and memory observed with vortioxetine in animal \nstudies. However, the precise contribution of the individual targets to the observed pharmacodynamic \nprofile remains unclear and caution should be applied when extrapolating animal data directly to man.  \n \nIn humans, two positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been conducted using 5-HT \ntransporter ligands (11C-MADAM or 11C-DASB) to quantify the 5-HT transporter occupancy in the \n\n\n\n28 \n\nbrain across different dose levels. The mean 5-HT transporter occupancy in the raphe nuclei was \napproximately 50% at 5 mg/day, 65% at 10 mg/day and increased to above 80% at 20 mg/day.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of vortioxetine have been studied in a clinical programme that included more \nthan 6,700 patients, of whom more than 3,700 were treated with vortioxetine in short-term \n(≤12 weeks) studies of major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve double-blind, placebo-controlled, \n6/8-week, fixed-dose studies have been conducted to investigate the short-term efficacy of \nvortioxetine in MDD in adults (including the elderly). The efficacy of vortioxetine was demonstrated \nwith at least one dosage group across 9 of the 12 studies, showing at least a 2-point difference to \nplacebo in the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or Hamilton Depression \nRating Scale 24-item (HAM-D24) total score. This was supported by clinical relevance as \ndemonstrated by the proportions of responders and remitters and the improvement in the Clinical \nGlobal Impression – Global Improvement (CGI-I) score. The efficacy of vortioxetine increased with \nincreasing dose.  \n \nThe effect in the individual studies was supported by the meta-analysis (MMRM) of the mean change \nfrom baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6/8 in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies in \nadults. In the meta-analysis, the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically \nsignificant: -2.3 points (p = 0.007), -3.6 points (p <0.001), and -4.6 points (p <0.001) for the 5, 10, and \n20 mg/day doses, respectively; the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis, \nbut the mean difference to placebo was -2.6 points. The efficacy of vortioxetine is supported by the \npooled responder analysis, in which the proportion of responders ranged from 46% to 49% for \nvortioxetine versus 34% for placebo (p <0.01; NRI analysis). \n \nFurthermore, vortioxetine, in the dose range of 5-20 mg/day, demonstrated efficacy on the broad range \nof depressive symptoms (assessed by improvement in all MADRS single–item scores).  \n \nThe efficacy of vortioxetine 10 or 20 mg/day was further demonstrated in a 12-week, \ndouble-blind, flexible-dose comparative study versus agomelatine 25 or 50 mg/day in patients with \nMDD. Vortioxetine was statistically significantly better than agomelatine as measured by \nimprovement in the MADRS total score and supported by the clinical relevance as demonstrated by \nthe proportions of responders and remitters and improvement in the CGI-I. \n \nMaintenance \nThe maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse-prevention study. Patients \nin remission after an initial 12-week open-label treatment period with vortioxetine were randomised to \nvortioxetine 5 or 10 mg/day or placebo and observed for relapse during a double-blind period of at \nleast 24 weeks (24 to 64 weeks). Vortioxetine was superior (p=0.004) to placebo on the primary \noutcome measure, the time to relapse of MDD, with a hazard ratio of 2.0; that is, the risk of relapse \nwas two times higher in the placebo group than in the vortioxetine group. \n \nElderly \nIn the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in elderly depressed patients (aged \n≥65 years, n=452, 156 of whom were on vortioxetine), vortioxetine 5 mg/day was superior to placebo \nas measured by improvement in the MADRS and HAM-D24 total scores. The effect seen with \nvortioxetine was a 4.7 point difference to placebo in MADRS total score at Week 8 (MMRM \nanalysis). \n \nPatients with severe depression or with depression and high levels of anxiety symptoms \nIn severely depressed patients (baseline MADRS total score ≥30) and in depressed patients with a high \nlevel of anxiety symptoms (baseline HAM-A total score ≥20) vortioxetine also demonstrated efficacy \nin the short-term studies in adults (the overall mean difference to placebo in MADRS total score at \nWeek 6/8 ranged from 2.8 to 7.3 points and from 3.6 to 7.3 points, respectively, (MMRM analysis)). \nIn the dedicated study in elderly, vortioxetine was also effective in these patients. \n\n\n\n29 \n\nThe maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was also demonstrated in this patient population in the \nlong-term relapse prevention study. \n \nEffects of vortioxetine on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the University of California San \nDiego Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) (objective measures) and Perceived Deficits \nQuestionnaire (PDQ) and Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire CPFQ (subjective \nmeasures) scores \nThe efficacy of vortioxetine (5-20 mg/day) in patients with MDD has been investigated in 2 adult and \n1 elderly short-term, placebo-controlled studies. \n \nVortioxetine had a statistically significant effect versus placebo on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test \n(DSST), ranging from Δ = 1.75 (p = 0.019) to 4.26 (p <0.0001) in the 2 studies in adults and Δ = 2.79 \n(p = 0.023) in the study in the elderly. In the meta-analyses (ANCOVA, LOCF) of the mean change \nfrom baseline in DSST number of correct symbols in all 3 studies, vortioxetine separated from placebo \n(p<0.05) with a standardised effect size of 0.35. When adjusting for the change in MADRS the total \nscore in the meta-analysis of the same studies showed that vortioxetine separated from placebo \n(p<0.05) with a standardised effect size of 0.24.  \nOne study assessed the effect of vortioxetine on functional capacity using the University of California \nSan Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA). Vortioxetine separated from placebo \nstatistically with results of 8.0 for vortioxetine versus 5.1 points for placebo (p=0.0003). \n \nIn one study, vortioxetine was superior to placebo on subjective measures, evaluated using the \nPerceived Deficits Questionnaire with results of -14.6 for vortioxetine and -10.5 for placebo \n(p=0.002). Vortioxetine did not separate from placebo on subjective measures when evaluated using \nthe Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire with results of -8.1 for vortioxetine versus -6.9 \nfor placebo (p=0.086). \n \nTolerability and safety \nThe safety and tolerability of vortioxetine have been established in short- and long-term studies across \nthe dose range of 5 to 20 mg/day. For information on undesirable effects, see section 4.8. \n \nVortioxetine did not increase the incidence of insomnia or somnolence relative to placebo. \nIn clinical short- and long-term placebo-controlled studies, potential discontinuation symptoms were \nsystematically evaluated after abrupt treatment cessation of vortioxetine. There was no clinically \nrelevant difference to placebo in the incidence or nature of the discontinuation symptoms after either \nshort-term (6-12 weeks) or long-term (24-64 weeks) treatment with vortioxetine. \n \nThe incidence of self-reported adverse sexual reactions was low and similar to placebo in clinical \nshort- and long-term studies with vortioxetine. In studies using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale \n(ASEX), the incidence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) and the ASEX total score \nshowed no clinically relevant difference to placebo in symptoms of sexual dysfunction at the 5 to \n15 mg/day doses of vortioxetine. For the 20 mg/day dose, an increase in TESD was seen compared to \nplacebo (an incidence difference of 14.2%, 95% CI [1.4, 27.0]). \n \nThe effect of vortioxetine on sexual function was further evaluated in an 8-week, double-blind, \nflexible-dose, comparative study (n=424) versus escitalopram in patients treated for at least 6 weeks \nwith an SSRI (citalopram, paroxetine, or sertraline), with a low level of depressive symptoms \n(baseline CGI-S ≤ 3) and TESD induced by the prior SSRI treatment. Vortioxetine 10-20 mg/day had \nstatistically significantly less TESD than escitalopram 10-20 mg/day as measured by change in the \nCSFQ-14 total score (2.2 points, p=0.013) at week 8. The proportion of responders was not \nsignificantly different in the vortioxetine group (162 (74.7%)) compared with the escitalopram group \n(137 (66.2%)) at week 8 (OR 1.5 p=0.057). The antidepressant effect was maintained in both \ntreatment groups. \n \nVortioxetine had no effect relative to placebo on body weight, heart rate, or blood pressure in clinical \nshort- and long-term studies. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nNo clinically significant changes were observed in hepatic or renal assessments in clinical studies.  \n \nVortioxetine has not shown any clinically significant effect on ECG parameters, including the QT, \nQTc, PR and QRS intervals, in patients with MDD. In a thorough QTc study in healthy subjects at \ndoses up to 40 mg daily, no potential for the prolongation of the QTc interval was observed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in major \ndepressive disorder with vortioxetine in children aged less than 7 years (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies in major \ndepressive disorder with vortioxetine in children and adolescents aged 7 to 18 years (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n\nVortioxetine is slowly, but well absorbed after oral administration and the peak plasma concentration \nis reached within 7 to 11 hours. Following multiple dosing of 5, 10, or 20 mg/day, mean Cmax values of \n9 to 33 ng/mL were observed. The absolute bioavailability is 75%. No effect of food on the \npharmacokinetics was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n\nThe mean volume of distribution (Vss) is 2,600 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. \nVortioxetine is highly bound to plasma proteins (98 to 99%) and the binding appears to be \nindependent of vortioxetine plasma concentrations. \n \nBiotransformation \n\nVortioxetine is extensively metabolised in the liver, primarily through oxidation catalysed by CYP2D6 \nand to a minor extent CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. \n \nNo inhibitory or inducing effect of vortioxetine was observed in the drug-drug interaction studies for \nthe CYP isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, \nor CYP3A4/5 (see section 4.5). Vortioxetine is a poor P-gp substrate and inhibitor. \n \nThe major metabolite of vortioxetine is pharmacologically inactive. \n \nElimination \n\nThe mean elimination half-life and oral clearance are 66 hours and 33 L/h, respectively. \nApproximately 2/3 of the inactive vortioxetine metabolites are excreted in the urine and approximately \n1/3 in the faeces. Only negligible amounts of vortioxetine are excreted in the faeces. Steady-state \nplasma concentrations are achieved in approximately 2 weeks. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nThe pharmacokinetics are linear and time independent in the dose range studied (2.5 to 60 mg/day). \n \nIn accordance with the half-life, the accumulation index is 5 to 6 based on AUC0-24h following multiple \ndoses of 5 to 20 mg/day. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nIn elderly healthy subjects (aged ≥65 years; n=20), the exposure to vortioxetine increased up to 27% \n(Cmax and AUC) compared to young healthy control subjects (aged ≤45 years) after multiple doses of \n10 mg/day. The lowest effective dose of 5 mg vortioxetine once daily should always be used as the \nstarting dose in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 4.2). However, caution should be exercised \nwhen prescribing to elderly patients at doses higher than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily (see section \n4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nFollowing a single dose of 10 mg vortioxetine, renal impairment estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault \nformula (mild, moderate, or severe; n=8 per group) caused modest exposure increases (up to 30%), \ncompared to healthy matched controls. In patients with end-stage renal disease, only a small fraction \nof vortioxetine was lost during dialysis (AUC and Cmax were 13% and 27% lower, respectively; n=8) \nfollowing a single 10 mg dose of vortioxetine. No dose adjustment is needed based on renal function \n(see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics in subjects (N = 6-8) with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh Criteria A, B, or C, respectively) were compared to healthy volunteers. The changes in AUC \nwere less than 10% lower in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, and 10% higher in \nthose with severe hepatic impairment. The changes in Cmax were less than 25% lower in all groups. No \ndose adjustment is needed based on hepatic function (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP2D6 gene types \nThe plasma concentration of vortioxetine was approximately two times higher in CYP2D6 poor \nmetabolisers than in extensive metabolisers. Co-administration of strong CYP3A4/2C9-inhibitors to \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers could potentially result in higher exposure (see section 4.5). \n \nIn CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers, the plasma concentration of vortioxetine 10 mg/day were \nbetween those obtained in extensive metabolisers at 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day. \nDepending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment may be considered (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of vortioxetine in the general toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs was mainly \nassociated with CNS-related clinical signs. These included salivation (rat and dog), pupil dilatation \n(dog), and two incidences of convulsions in dogs in the general toxicity study programme.. A no-effect \nlevel for convulsions was established with a corresponding safety margin of 5 considering the \nmaximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. Target organ toxicity was restricted to \nkidneys (rats) and liver (mice and rats). The changes in the kidney in rats (glomerulonephritis, renal \ntubular obstruction, crystalline material in renal tubule) and in the liver of mice and rats \n(hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocyte necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, crystalline material in bile \nducts) were seen at exposures more than 10-fold (mice) and 2-fold (rats) the human exposure at the \nmaximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. These findings were mainly attributed to \nrodent-specific vortioxetine-related crystalline material obstruction of the renal tubules and the bile \nducts, respectively, and considered of low risk to humans. \n \nVortioxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n \nBased on results from conventional 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice or rats, vortioxetine is not \nconsidered to pose a risk of carcinogenicity in humans. \n \nVortioxetine had no effect on rat fertility, mating performance, reproductive organs, or sperm \nmorphology and motility. Vortioxetine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but reproductive toxicity \n\n\n\n32 \n\nin terms of effects on foetal weight and delayed ossification were seen in the rat at exposures more \nthan 10-fold the human exposure at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. \nSimilar effects were seen in the rabbit at sub-therapeutic exposure. \n \nIn a pre- and post-natal study in rats, vortioxetine was associated with increased pup mortality, \nreduced bodyweight gain, and delayed pup development at doses that did not result in maternal \ntoxicity and with associated exposures similar to those achieved in humans following administration \nof vortioxetine 20 mg/day (see section 4.6). \n \nVortioxetine-related material was distributed to the milk of lactating rats (see section 4.6). \n \nIn juvenile toxicity studies in rats, all vortioxetine treatment-related findings were consistent with \nthose noted in adult animals. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that vortioxetine has the potential to be pesistent, \nbioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (risk to fish). However, by recommended patient usage \nvortioxetine is considered to pose negligible risk to the aquatic and terrestrial environment (see section \n6.6). \n \n \n6.

It belongs to a group of medicines called \nantidepressants. \n \nBrintellix is used to treat major depressive episodes in adults. \n \nBrintellix has been shown to reduce the broad range of depressive symptoms, including sadness, inner \ntension (feeling anxious), sleep disturbances (reduced sleep), reduced appetite, difficulty in \nconcentrating, feelings of worthlessness, loss of interest in favourite activities, feeling of being slowed \ndown. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Brintellix \n \nDo not take Brintellix: \n \n- if you are allergic to vortioxetine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are taking other medicines for depression known as non-selective monoamine oxidase \n\ninhibitors or selective MAO-A inhibitors. Ask your doctor if you are uncertain.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brintellix if you: \n \n- are taking medicines with a so-called serotonergic effect, such as: \n\n- tramadol (a strong painkiller).  \n- sumatriptan and similar medicines with active substance names ending in “triptans” (used \n\nto treat migraine). \n\n\n\n70 \n\nTaking these medicines together with Brintellix may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. \nThis syndrome may be associated with hallucinations, involuntary twitching, accelerated \nheartbeat, high blood pressure, fever, nausea and diarrhoea. \n \n\n- have had fits (seizures).  \nYour doctor will treat you cautiously if you have a history of fits or have unstable fit \ndisorders/epilepsy. Fits are a potential risk with medicines used to treat depression. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in any patient who develops fits or where there is an increase in the \nfrequency of fits. \n \n\n- have had mania \n- have a tendency to bleed or bruise easily. \n- have low sodium level in the blood. \n- are 65 years of age or older. \n- have a severe kidney disease. \n- have a severe liver disease or a liver disease called cirrhosis. \n- have or previously have had increased pressure in the eye or glaucoma. If your eyes become \n\npainful and you develop blurred vision during treatment, contact your doctor. \n \nWhen you are on antidepressant treatment, including vortioxetine, you may also experience feelings of \naggression, agitation, anger and irritability. If this occurs, you should talk to your doctor.  \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression \n \nIf you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or \nkilling yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all \ntake time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer.  \n \nYou may be more likely to think like this if you:  \n- have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself.  \n- are a young adult.  \n\n \nInformation from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in adults aged less \nthan 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an antidepressant.  \n \nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital \nstraight away. You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have \nan anxiety disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your \ndepression or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nBrintellix is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of information \nfor this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Brintellix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n \n- phenelzine, iproniazid, isocarboxazid, nialamide, tranylcypromine (medicines to treat \n\ndepression called non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors); you must not take any of these \nmedicines together with Brintellix. If you have taken any of these medicines, you will need to \n\n\n\n71 \n\nwait 14 days before you start taking Brintellix. After stopping Brintellix you must allow 14 days \nbefore taking any of these medicines. \n\n- moclobemide (a medicine to treat depression).  \n- selegiline, rasagiline (medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease). \n- linezolid (a medicine to treat bacterial infections). \n- lithium (a medicine to treat depression and mental disorders) or tryptophan. \n- medicines known to cause low sodium level. \n- rifampicin (a medicine to treat tuberculosis and other infections). \n- carbamazepine, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy or other illness). \n- warfarin, dipyridamole, phenprocoumon, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (blood thinning \n\nmedicines). \n \nMedicines that increase the risk of fits: \n- sumatriptan and similar medicines with active substance names ending in “triptans”. \n- tramadol (a strong painkiller).  \n- mefloquine (a medicine to prevent and treat malaria). \n- bupropion (a medicine to treat depression also used to wean from smoking). \n- fluoxetine, paroxetine and other medicines to treat depression called SSRI/SNRIs, tricyclics.  \n- St John’s wort (hypericum perforatum) (a medicine to treat depression). \n- quinidine (a medicine to treat heart rhythm disorders). \n- chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, haloperidol (medicines to treat mental disorders belonging to \n\nthe groups called phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, butyrophenones). \n \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines above, since your doctor needs to know \nif you already are at risk for seizures. \n \nIf you are having a urine drug screen, taking Brintellix may cause positive results for methadone when \nsome test methods are used, even though you may not be taking methadone. If this happens, a more \nspecific test can be performed. \n \nBrintellix with alcohol \n \nCombining this medicine with alcohol is not advisable. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nBrintellix should not be used during pregnancy unless the doctor says it is absolutely necessary. \n \nIf you take medicines to treat depression, including Brintellix, during the last 3 months of your \npregnancy, you should be aware that the following effects may be seen in your newborn baby: trouble \nwith breathing, bluish skin, fits, body temperature changes, feeding difficulties, vomiting, low blood \nsugar, stiff or floppy muscles, vivid reflexes, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, \nsleepiness and sleeping difficulties. Contact your doctor immediately if your newborn baby has any of \nthese symptoms.  \n \nMake sure your midwife and/or doctor know you are on Brintellix. When taken during pregnancy, \nparticularly in the last 3 months of pregnancy, medicines like Brintellix may increase the risk of a \nserious condition in babies, called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making \nthe baby breathe faster and appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours \nafter the baby is born. If this happens to your baby, you should contact your midwife and/or doctor \nimmediately. \n\n\n\n72 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is expected that the ingredients of Brintellix will pass into breast milk. Brintellix is not to be used \nduring breast-feeding. Your doctor will make a decision on whether you should stop breast-feeding, or \nstop using Brintellix taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for your child, and the benefit of \ntherapy for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nBrintellix has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, as adverse \nreactions such as diziness have been reported, caution is advised during such activities when \nbeginning Brintellix treatment or changing the dose. \n \nBrintellix contains Sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to take Brintellix \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose of Brintellix is 10 mg vortioxetine taken as one daily dose in adults less than \n65 years of age. The dose may be increased by your doctor to a maximum of 20 mg vortioxetine per \nday or lowered to a minimum of 5 mg vortioxetine per day depending on your response to treatment. \n \nFor elderly people 65 years of age or older, the starting dose is 5 mg vortioxetine taken once daily. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTake one tablet with a glass of water.  \nThe tablet can be taken with or without food. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nTake Brintellix for as long as your doctor recommends. \n \nContinue to take Brintellix even if it takes some time before you feel any improvement in your \ncondition.  \n \nTreatment should be continued for at least 6 months after you feel well again. \n \nIf you take more Brintellix than you should \n \nIf you take more than the prescribed dose of Brintellix, contact your doctor or nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. Have the container and any remaining tablets available. Do this \neven if there are no signs of discomfort. Overdose signs could be dizziness, nausea, diarrhoea, \nstomach discomfort, itching of the whole body, sleepiness and flushing.  \n \nFollowing intake of dosages several times higher than the prescribed dose, fits (seizures) and a rare \ncondition called serotonin syndrome have been reported. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nIf you forget to take Brintellix \n \nTake the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Brintellix \n \nDo not stop taking Brintellix without talking with your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take Brintellix  \n3. How to take Brintellix  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Brintellix  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Brintellix is and what it is used for \n \nBrintellix contains the active substance vortioxetine.It belongs to a group of medicines called \nantidepressants. \n \nBrintellix is used to treat major depressive episodes in adults. \n \nBrintellix has been shown to reduce the broad range of depressive symptoms, including sadness, inner \ntension (feeling anxious), sleep disturbances (reduced sleep), reduced appetite, difficulty in \nconcentrating, feelings of worthlessness, loss of interest in favourite activities, feeling of being slowed \ndown. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Brintellix \n \nDo not take Brintellix: \n \n- if you are allergic to vortioxetine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are taking other medicines for depression known as non-selective monoamine oxidase \n\ninhibitors or selective MAO-A inhibitors. Ask your doctor if you are uncertain.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brintellix if you: \n \n- are taking medicines with a so-called serotonergic effect, such as: \n\n- tramadol (a strong painkiller). \n- sumatriptan and similar medicines to Brintellix with active substance names ending in \n\n“triptans” (used to treatmigraine).  \n\n\n\n86 \n\nTaking these medicines together with Brintellix may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. \nThis syndrome may be associated with hallucinations, involuntary twitching, accelerated \nheartbeat, high blood pressure, fever, nausea and diarrhoea. \n \n\n- have had fits (seizures).  \nYour doctor will treat you cautiously if you have a history of fits or have unstable fit \ndisorders/elpilepsy. Fits are a potential risk with medicines used to treat depression. Treatment \nshould be discontinued in any patient who develops fits or where there is an increase in the \nfrequency of fits.  \n \n\n- have had mania.  \n- have a tendency bleed or bruise easily. \n- have low sodium level in the blood. \n- are 65 years of age or older. \n- have a severe kidney disease.. \n- have a severe liver disease or a liver disease called cirrhosis. \n- have or previously have had increased pressure in the eye or glaucoma. If your eyes become \n\npainful and you develop blurred vision during treatment, contact your doctor. \nWhen you are on antidepressant treatment, including vortioxetine, you may also experience feelings of \naggression, agitation, anger and irritability. If this occurs, you should talk to your doctor.  \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression \n \nIf you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or \nkilling yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all \ntake time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer.  \n \nYou may be more likely to think like this if you:  \n- have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself.  \n- are a young adult.  \n\n \nInformation from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in adults aged less \nthan 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an antidepressant.  \n \nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital \nstraight away. You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have \nan anxiety disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your \ndepression or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nBrintellix is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of information \nfor this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Brintellix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- phenelzine, iproniazid, isocarboxazid, nialamide, tranylcypromine (medicines to treat \n\ndepression called non-selectve monoamine oxidase inhibitors) you must not take any of these \nmedicines together with Brintellix. If you have taken any of these medicines, you will need to \nwait 14 days before you start taking Brintellix. After stopping Brintellix, you must allow 14 \ndays before taking any of these medicines. \n\n- moclobemide (a medicine to treat depression).  \n\n\n\n87 \n\n- selegiline, rasagiline (medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease).  \n- linezolid (a medicine to treat bacterial infections) . \n- lithium (a medicine to treat depression and mental disorders) or tryptophan. \n- medicines known to cause low sodium level. \n- rifampicin (a medicine to treat tuberculosis and other infections).  \n- carbamazepine, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy or other illness). \n- warfarin, dipyridamole, phenprocoumon, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (blood thinning \n\nmedicines). \n \nMedicines that increase the risk of fits: \n- sumatriptan and similar medicines with active substance names ending in “triptans”.  \n- tramadol (a strong painkiller).  \n- mefloquine (a medicine to prevent and treat malaria).  \n- bupropion (a medicine to treat depression also used to wean from smoking). \n- fluoxetine, paroxetine and other medicine to treat depression called SSRI/SNRIs, tricyclics.  \n- St John’s wort (hypericum perforatum) (a medicine to treat depression). \n- quinidine (a medicine to treat heart rhythm disorders).  \n- chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, haloperidol (medicines to treat mental disorders belonging to \n\nthe group called phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, butyrophenones). \n \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines above, since your doctor needs to know \nif you already are at risk for seizures. \n \nIf you are having a urine drug screen, taking Brintellix may cause positive results for methadone when \nsome test methods are used, even though you may not be taking methadone. If this happens, a more \nspecific test can be performed. \n \nBrintellix with alcohol \n \nCombining this medicine with alcohol is not advisable. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nBrintellix should not be used during pregnancy unless the doctor says it is absolutely necessary. \n \nIf you take medicine to treat depression, including Brintellix, during the last 3 months of your \npregnancy, you should be aware that the following effects may be seen in your newborn baby: trouble \nwith breathing, bluish skin, fits, body temperature changes, feeding difficulties, vomiting, low blood \nsugar, stiff or floppy muscles, vivid reflexes, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, \nsleepiness and sleeping difficulties. Contact your doctor immediately if your newborn baby has any of \nthese symptoms. \n \nMake sure your midwife and/or doctor know you are on Brintellix. When taken during pregnancy, \nparticularly in the last 3 months of pregnancy, medicines like Brintellix may increase the risk of a \nserious condition in babies, called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making \nthe baby breathe faster and appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours \nafter the baby is born. If this happens to your baby, you should contact your midwife and/or doctor \nimmediately. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is expected that the ingredients of Brintellix will pass into breast milk.

However, as adverse \nreactions such as diziness have been reported, caution is advised during such activities when \nbeginning Brintellix treatment or changing the dose. \n \nBrintellix contains Sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3.

The \nPRAC concluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be \namended accordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on insomnia from spontaneous reports including in 99 cases a close \ntemporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal \nrelationship between vortioxetine and insomnia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC \nconcluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be amended \naccordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on agitation and aggression from spontaneous reports including in 351 \nevents within the SMQ hostility / aggression a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge \nand/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal \nrelationship between vortioxetine and aggression and agitation is at least a reasonable possibility. \nThe PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be \namended accordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on glaucoma from clinical trials, spontaneous reports including in 5 cases a \nclose temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible \nmechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and glaucoma \nis at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products \ncontaining vortioxetine should be amended accordingly. \n\n \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  \n\n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for vortioxetine the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vortioxetine is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information. \n\n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
